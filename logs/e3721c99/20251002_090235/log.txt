=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 09:02:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return max((max(row) for row in grid), default=0)

def find_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = set()
    palette = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[i])):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if 0 < c < max_c and c not in seen:
                seen.add(c)
                palette.append(c)
    return palette

def has_full_one_row(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    size = len(grid)
    for row in grid:
        if all(c == 1 for c in row):
            return True
    return False

def get_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    palette = find_palette(grid)
    if not has_full_one_row(grid):
        palette = [c for c in palette if c != 1]
    return palette

def compute_replacement(i: int, j: int, palette: List[int]) -> int:
    if not palette:
        return 0
    return palette[(i + j) % len(palette)]

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 09:16:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty), where the goal is to transform sparse, patterned, or outlined placements of colors into solid, filled blocks or shapes of consistent colors, likely by interpreting scattered high-value cells as frames, checkers, or sparse indicators that need to be densified or replaced to form coherent solid regions. The transformation preserves some existing patterns (like the top solid-like rows in training example 1) but fills in 0s and adjusts high colors to create uniform blocks of lower colors (e.g., 1,2,3,4) in specific geometric arrangements, such as full rows, rectangles, or aligned clusters.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are large (30x30 based on output lists), mostly 0s, with sparse non-zero colors; focus on connected or patterned groups rather than isolated cells.
 * High colors (e.g., max_c like 4 in train 1, 6 in test) appear in sparse or alternating patterns (e.g., checkers in train 1 row 2), which should be resolved into solid blocks of a single lower color, not cycled replacements.
 * Palette extraction should identify unique non-zero, non-max colors (1,2,3 in train 1; 2,3 in train 2), but exclude 1 if no full row of 1s exists—however, this logic fails as it doesn't fill 0s or expand patterns.
 * Full rows of 1s (e.g., row 5 in both trains) are preserved or introduced as dividers/borders; subtle: 1s often form horizontal barriers or solid lines.
 * Patterns like alternating colors (e.g., 3,0,3 in train 1 row 2) become solid (3,3,3), suggesting "fill the gaps" rule for same-color sparse lines or checkers.
 * Blocks must align to form larger shapes: e.g., in train 1 expected, lower sections have rectangular 3s, 4s, 1s, 2s stacked or adjacent; in train 2, vertical/horizontal solids of 2s and 3s.
 * Subtle: Replacements aren't simple (i+j) cycling; instead, entire regions get uniform color (e.g., all 4s in a block), possibly based on majority color or position-based assignment to palette.
 * 0s in between same-color cells must be filled if part of a pattern; isolated high colors may stay or be removed, but connected/sparse groups expand.
 * No full-row-1 check seems universal—train 1 has it, train 2 doesn't emphasize it, but 1s appear in solids anyway.
 * Max color replacement only touches max_c cells, ignoring 0-fills; expected changes many 0s to colors, indicating region detection (e.g., bounding boxes or flood-fill).
 * Consider object extraction: Identify "blobs" (connected components of non-0, ignoring max_c as outlines) and fill their convex hull or minimal bounding rectangle with a palette color.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns stay 0; patterns don't overlap or bleed; test has 4,5,6 suggesting palette [1,4,5?] but needs solid fills like 6->uniform 4 or similar.
 * All non-0 colors < max are palette candidates, but assignment is per-region, not per-cell.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

# Useful for identifying unique colors excluding max and 0
def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return max((max(row) for row in grid), default=0)

def find_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

    seen = set()
    palette = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[i])):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if 0 < c < max_c and c not in seen:
                seen.add(c)
                palette.append(c)
    return sorted(palette)  # Sort for consistent ordering if needed

# Checks for full row of 1s, potentially to decide if 1 is special/barrier
def has_full_one_row(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:

            return True
    return False

# Potentially useful for region detection: find connected components (blobs) of non-0 cells
# This could help identify areas to fill; current version is basic 4-connected
def extract_blobs(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # Returns list of (color, size, max_c_count, positions) for non-0 regions
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    directions = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]  # 4-connected
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = grid[i][j]
                positions = []
                max_c_count = 0
                stack = [(i,j)]
                size = 0
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    positions.append((x,y))
                    size += 1
                    if grid[x][y] == find_max_color(grid):
                        max_c_count += 1
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] != 0:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if size > 0:
                    blobs.append((color, size, max_c_count, positions))
    return blobs

# To fill a bounding box of positions with a single color (helpful for solid blocks)
def fill_region(grid: List[List[int]], positions: List[Tuple[int,int]], fill_color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
    min_i, max_i = min(p[0] for p in positions), max(p[0] for p in positions)
    min_j, max_j = min(p[1] for p in positions), max(p[1] for p in positions)
    for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1):
        for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
            new_grid[i][j] = fill_color  # Overwrite to solid
    return new_grid
```
Note: `extract_blobs` is helpful for detecting regions to fill but needs refinement (e.g., treat max_c as outlines, fill interior 0s). `fill_region` assumes rectangular fill, which matches expected solids but may overfill non-rect shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies max color and basic palette (e.g., [1,2,3] for train 1, excluding 4; [2,3] for train 2, excluding higher), and preserves some top patterns (e.g., rows 1-3 in train 1 match expected).
 * Replacement logic (cycling palette via (i+j) % len(palette) only for max_c cells) works partially for sparse max_c but fails to fill 0s, leading to scattered results instead of solids (e.g., train 1 row 8 generated has isolated 1,2; expected has solid 4,4).
 * has_full_one_row correctly detects row 5 of 1s in train 1 and excludes 1 from palette if absent, but this doesn't help filling and is irrelevant for train 2 where 1s appear in solids without full rows.
 * compute_replacement is unhelpful/broken: (i+j) modulo creates alternating patterns (e.g., train 1 lower generated has mixed 1,2,3,4 instead of uniform blocks like expected's 3,3,3 or 1,1,1,1).
 * No region detection: Program ignores connected components, so it doesn't expand sparse patterns (e.g., train 2 row 2 generated keeps alternating 2,3; expected fills to solid 2s across).
 * Train 1 mismatches in lower half: Generated scatters palette colors into original 0s/max positions (e.g., row 9 has 4,3,1 but isolated; expected has solid 3,3,3), unknown reason but likely due to no fill logic—it's different by not densifying.
 * Train 2 mismatches broadly: Generated introduces wrong placements (e.g., row 1 has 3,2 in position 18-19; expected has 2,2), and fails to create large solids (e.g., row 14 expected has solid 2s and 3s; generated mixes).
 * get_palette excludes 1 correctly sometimes but doesn't use it for filling full rows/blocks.
 * Overall, program only touches max_c cells, but expected changes 0s too, indicating need for blob extraction and filling.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it retains many original 5s and 6s in scattered patterns (e.g., row 2 has mixed 5,6,4; row 3 has long 5s but interrupted), without forming solid blocks like expected in trains (e.g., no uniform 4,5,6 regions).
 * It appears to replace some 6s with palette cycles (possibly [1,4,5]? since 1s in column 24, 4/5/6 mixed elsewhere), but leaves most 5s intact and doesn't fill 0s (e.g., row 0 has isolated 5s and 1; should likely be solid horizontal 5s or similar based on train patterns).
 * Missing solid fills: e.g., row 7 generated has [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,...] with gaps; expected logic would fill to [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,...] or assign uniform color per cluster.
 * Introduces 1s in column 24 across rows, possibly from palette, but they form a vertical line without expansion, unlike train solids; this doesn't match coherent blocks and seems like erroneous per-cell replacement.
 * Lower rows (e.g., row 20) keep sparse 5s without densifying to rectangles, and end with mixed 4s—looks incorrect as it doesn't resolve patterns into uniforms, differing from train expectations where alternates become solids.

[2025-10-02 09:16:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10.

[2025-10-02 09:37:44] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where cells with values ≤4 (including 0s and pre-colored 1-4) remain unchanged, while connected components of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored with cycling colors 1-4 based on the order in which the components are first discovered during a raster-order scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The goal is to produce a output grid that matches expected colorings for these components, likely representing some form of blob detection and labeling in a larger puzzle context, such as distinguishing shapes or regions in a nonogram-like or segmentation task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed only from cells >4, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), treating ≤4 cells as barriers that cannot be crossed.
 * Discovery order for assigning colors is strictly raster: scan row 0 left-to-right, then row 1, etc.; the first unvisited >4 cell encountered starts a new component, which gets the next color in cycle (1 for first, 2 for second, 3 for third, 4 for fourth, then back to 1).
 * All cells in a component must be uniformly colored with the assigned color, replacing their original >4 value; no partial coloring or retention of original values.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous in appearance due to ≤4 barriers, but the flood-fill must not leak across them; easy to miss if stack-based fill visits invalid neighbors.
 * Another subtlety: Large horizontal or vertical strips (e.g., entire rows of >4) form single components if connected, but scattered >4 cells separated by ≤4 are separate components discovered independently.
 * Input grids seem to contain pre-existing 1-4 colors in some areas (unchanged), suggesting the puzzle overlays new component coloring only on >4 regions without overwriting existing 1-4.
 * Potential miss: If input has isolated >4 cells or thin shapes, they each get their own color based on discovery position; over-merging components (e.g., via 8-connectivity) would incorrectly combine them.
 * Flood-fill must mark visited to avoid re-coloring; non-recursive stack is fine but must handle bounds correctly.
 * Overall puzzle likely tests understanding of image segmentation: >4 as "foreground" blobs to label sequentially.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating original."""
    return deepcopy(g)

def is_valid(x: int, y: int, size: int) -> bool:
    """Check if position (x, y) is within grid bounds [0, size-1]."""
    return 0 <= x < size and 0 <= y < size
```

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], g: List[List[int]], x: int, y: int, color: int, size: int):
    """Non-recursive flood-fill for a 4-connected component of >4 cells, coloring with given color."""
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity only
    stack = [(x, y)]
    visited[x][y] = True
    h[x][y] = color
    while stack:
        cx, cy = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_valid(nx, ny, size) and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt uses correct structure for raster-order discovery and 4-connected flood-fill on >4 cells, leaving ≤4 unchanged, which works for basic component detection (e.g., upper regions in training 1 match expected for colors 4,3,1,2 in rows 1-3).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and colors some early-discovered components, like the vertical 4s in row1-3 col1-3, horizontal 3s in row1-3 col5-7, striped 1s in row1-3 col9-13, and long 2s in row1-3 col15-21; also handles full-row 1s in row5 perfectly.
 * What didn't work: Color assignments mismatch for later components due to apparent errors in discovery order or component merging; e.g., in training 1, a small 2x1 component in row8 col10-11 is colored 2 in generated but should be 4 in expected (suggesting it was discovered as the 4th component, not 2nd); similarly, lower-left 3s (rows9-11 col3-6) are correct but adjacent 2s in row10-11 col8-11 become 2s instead of expected 4s, indicating over-merging or skipped components.
 * In training 1, generated incorrectly colors a blob in rows12-16 col20-25 as mixed 4s and 1s, while expected has consistent 1s there, showing flood-fill didn't fully capture the component (possibly due to barriers or visit bugs).
 * In training 2, early components (2s/3s/1s in rows1-6) mostly match, but mid-grid mismatches like row9 col10-12 colored 4 instead of expected 2, and large 3-blob in rows9-25 col20-27 partially correct but with wrong cycling (e.g., row20 col20-24 as 3s but expected has splits into separate 3-components); lower 4s in rows23-27 also mismatched.
 * extract_objects not present in attempt, but could be helpful for debugging: a function to list component sizes/positions before coloring to verify discovery order.
 * The copy_grid and is_valid are helpful and correct; flood_fill is mostly helpful but subtly broken in handling large/irregular shapes (e.g., doesn't fully propagate in L-shapes or around 0-barriers in training 1 lower sections).
 * assign_colors_to_components is the core logic and helpful, but buggy in component ID cycling—perhaps off-by-one in (component_id % 4) + 1, or raster scan misses isolated cells.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, but flood_fill could be improved with queue (BFS) for consistent order vs stack (DFS), though DFS should work if visited is proper.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same logic, coloring >4 regions with 1-4 (e.g., large 3-blob in rows2-7 col1-7, 2s in rows4-6 col20-22, 1s scattered in col24, 4s in col26-28), leaving 0s and presumed pre-4s unchanged, which seems consistent with the attempt's approach.
 * It does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., the sprawling 3 in upper-left might be over-merged (rows2-7 col1-8 includes separated parts via row7 col4-6, but if 0s barrier, should split); similarly, mid-grid 2s in rows9-16 col16-23 appear as one big component but likely should cycle colors for sub-parts like the vertical in row15-16 col16-19 vs horizontal in row12 col13-16.
 * Lower 4s in rows17-30 col26-28 are consistent stripes, but interspersed 1s in col24 suggest correct isolation; however, without expected test output, hard to confirm, but mismatches like irregular 1-blob in rows20-29 col10-24 (jumping around) indicate flood-fill didn't connect properly (e.g., row22 col9-12 as 1s but separated by 0s from row24 col8-11).
 * Overall, test output follows the flawed pattern from training (partial matches in early/simple components, errors in complex/later ones), so likely incorrect in color order/merging; to fix, need to verify input grid's >4 positions mentally—e.g., if test has diagonal >4 connections, 4-connectivity fails.

[2025-10-02 09:37:44] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty), where the goal is to transform sparse, patterned, or outlined placements of colors into solid, filled blocks or shapes of consistent colors, likely by interpreting scattered high-value cells as frames, checkers, or sparse indicators that need to be densified or replaced to form coherent solid regions. The transformation preserves some existing patterns (like the top solid-like rows in training example 1) but fills in 0s and adjusts high colors to create uniform blocks of lower colors (e.g., 1,2,3,4) in specific geometric arrangements, such as full rows, rectangles, or aligned clusters.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are large (30x30 based on output lists), mostly 0s, with sparse non-zero colors; focus on connected or patterned groups rather than isolated cells.
 * High colors (e.g., max_c like 4 in train 1, 6 in test) appear in sparse or alternating patterns (e.g., checkers in train 1 row 2), which should be resolved into solid blocks of a single lower color, not cycled replacements.
 * Palette extraction should identify unique non-zero, non-max colors (1,2,3 in train 1; 2,3 in train 2), but exclude 1 if no full row of 1s exists—however, this logic fails as it doesn't fill 0s or expand patterns.
 * Full rows of 1s (e.g., row 5 in both trains) are preserved or introduced as dividers/borders; subtle: 1s often form horizontal barriers or solid lines.
 * Patterns like alternating colors (e.g., 3,0,3 in train 1 row 2) become solid (3,3,3), suggesting "fill the gaps" rule for same-color sparse lines or checkers.
 * Blocks must align to form larger shapes: e.g., in train 1 expected, lower sections have rectangular 3s, 4s, 1s, 2s stacked or adjacent; in train 2, vertical/horizontal solids of 2s and 3s.
 * Subtle: Replacements aren't simple (i+j) cycling; instead, entire regions get uniform color (e.g., all 4s in a block), possibly based on majority color or position-based assignment to palette.
 * 0s in between same-color cells must be filled if part of a pattern; isolated high colors may stay or be removed, but connected/sparse groups expand.
 * No full-row-1 check seems universal—train 1 has it, train 2 doesn't emphasize it, but 1s appear in solids anyway.
 * Max color replacement only touches max_c cells, ignoring 0-fills; expected changes many 0s to colors, indicating region detection (e.g., bounding boxes or flood-fill).
 * Consider object extraction: Identify "blobs" (connected components of non-0, ignoring max_c as outlines) and fill their convex hull or minimal bounding rectangle with a palette color.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns stay 0; patterns don't overlap or bleed; test has 4,5,6 suggesting palette [1,4,5?] but needs solid fills like 6->uniform 4 or similar.
 * All non-0 colors < max are palette candidates, but assignment is per-region, not per-cell.

                if size > 0:
                    blobs.append((color, size, max_c_count, positions))
    return blobs

# To fill a bounding box of positions with a single color (helpful for solid blocks)
def fill_region(grid: List[List[int]], positions: List[Tuple[int,int]], fill_color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
    min_i, max_i = min(p[0] for p in positions), max(p[0] for p in positions)
    min_j, max_j = min(p[1] for p in positions), max(p[1] for p in positions)
    for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1):
        for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
            new_grid[i][j] = fill_color  # Overwrite to solid
    return new_grid
```
Note: `extract_blobs` is helpful for detecting regions to fill but needs refinement (e.g., treat max_c as outlines, fill interior 0s). `fill_region` assumes rectangular fill, which matches expected solids but may overfill non-rect shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies max color and basic palette (e.g., [1,2,3] for train 1, excluding 4; [2,3] for train 2, excluding higher), and preserves some top patterns (e.g., rows 1-3 in train 1 match expected).
 * Replacement logic (cycling palette via (i+j) % len(palette) only for max_c cells) works partially for sparse max_c but fails to fill 0s, leading to scattered results instead of solids (e.g., train 1 row 8 generated has isolated 1,2; expected has solid 4,4).
 * has_full_one_row correctly detects row 5 of 1s in train 1 and excludes 1 from palette if absent, but this doesn't help filling and is irrelevant for train 2 where 1s appear in solids without full rows.
 * compute_replacement is unhelpful/broken: (i+j) modulo creates alternating patterns (e.g., train 1 lower generated has mixed 1,2,3,4 instead of uniform blocks like expected's 3,3,3 or 1,1,1,1).
 * No region detection: Program ignores connected components, so it doesn't expand sparse patterns (e.g., train 2 row 2 generated keeps alternating 2,3; expected fills to solid 2s across).
 * Train 1 mismatches in lower half: Generated scatters palette colors into original 0s/max positions (e.g., row 9 has 4,3,1 but isolated; expected has solid 3,3,3), unknown reason but likely due to no fill logic—it's different by not densifying.
 * Train 2 mismatches broadly: Generated introduces wrong placements (e.g., row 1 has 3,2 in position 18-19; expected has 2,2), and fails to create large solids (e.g., row 14 expected has solid 2s and 3s; generated mixes).
 * get_palette excludes 1 correctly sometimes but doesn't use it for filling full rows/blocks.
 * Overall, program only touches max_c cells, but expected changes 0s too, indicating need for blob extraction and filling.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it retains many original 5s and 6s in scattered patterns (e.g., row 2 has mixed 5,6,4; row 3 has long 5s but interrupted), without forming solid blocks like expected in trains (e.g., no uniform 4,5,6 regions).
 * It appears to replace some 6s with palette cycles (possibly [1,4,5]? since 1s in column 24, 4/5/6 mixed elsewhere), but leaves most 5s intact and doesn't fill 0s (e.g., row 0 has isolated 5s and 1; should likely be solid horizontal 5s or similar based on train patterns).
 * Missing solid fills: e.g., row 7 generated has [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,...] with gaps; expected logic would fill to [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,...] or assign uniform color per cluster.
 * Introduces 1s in column 24 across rows, possibly from palette, but they form a vertical line without expansion, unlike train solids; this doesn't match coherent blocks and seems like erroneous per-cell replacement.
 * Lower rows (e.g., row 20) keep sparse 5s without densifying to rectangles, and end with mixed 4s—looks incorrect as it doesn't resolve patterns into uniforms, differing from train expectations where alternates become solids.

**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where cells with values ≤4 (including 0s and pre-colored 1-4) remain unchanged, while connected components of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored with cycling colors 1-4 based on the order in which the components are first discovered during a raster-order scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

 * What didn't work: Color assignments mismatch for later components due to apparent errors in discovery order or component merging; e.g., in training 1, a small 2x1 component in row8 col10-11 is colored 2 in generated but should be 4 in expected (suggesting it was discovered as the 4th component, not 2nd); similarly, lower-left 3s (rows9-11 col3-6) are correct but adjacent 2s in row10-11 col8-11 become 2s instead of expected 4s, indicating over-merging or skipped components.

 * In training 2, early components (2s/3s/1s in rows1-6) mostly match, but mid-grid mismatches like row9 col10-12 colored 4 instead of expected 2, and large 3-blob in rows9-25 col20-27 partially correct but with wrong cycling (e.g., row20 col20-24 as 3s but expected has splits into separate 3-components); lower 4s in rows23-27 also mismatched.
 * extract_objects not present in attempt, but could be helpful for debugging: a function to list component sizes/positions before coloring to verify discovery order.
 * The copy_grid and is_valid are helpful and correct; flood_fill is mostly helpful but subtly broken in handling large/irregular shapes (e.g., doesn't fully propagate in L-shapes or around 0-barriers in training 1 lower sections).
 * assign_colors_to_components is the core logic and helpful, but buggy in component ID cycling—perhaps off-by-one in (component_id % 4) + 1, or raster scan misses isolated cells.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same logic, coloring >4 regions with 1-4 (e.g., large 3-blob in rows2-7 col1-7, 2s in rows4-6 col20-22, 1s scattered in col24, 4s in col26-28), leaving 0s and presumed pre-4s unchanged, which seems consistent with the attempt's approach.
 * It does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., the sprawling 3 in upper-left might be over-merged (rows2-7 col1-8 includes separated parts via row7 col4-6, but if 0s barrier, should split); similarly, mid-grid 2s in rows9-16 col16-23 appear as one big component but likely should cycle colors for sub-parts like the vertical in row15-16 col16-19 vs horizontal in row12 col13-16.
 * Lower 4s in rows17-30 col26-28 are consistent stripes, but interspersed 1s in col24 suggest correct isolation; however, without expected test output, hard to confirm, but mismatches like irregular 1-blob in rows20-29 col10-24 (jumping around) indicate flood-fill didn't connect properly (e.g., row22 col9-12 as 1s but separated by 0s from row24 col8-11).
 * Overall, test output follows the flawed pattern from training (partial matches in early/simple components, errors in complex/later ones), so likely incorrect in color order/merging; to fix, need to verify input grid's >4 positions mentally—e.g., if test has diagonal >4 connections, 4-connectivity fails.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 09:50:05] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from collections import deque

def is_high(c: int) -> bool:
    return c > 4

def get_color(component_id: int) -> int:
    palette = [4, 3, 1, 2]
    return palette[component_id % len(palette)]

def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and is_high(g[nx][ny]) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    h = copy.deepcopy(g)
    visited = [[False] * size for _ in range(size)]
    component_id = 0
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if is_high(g[i][j]) and not visited[i][j]:
                color = get_color(component_id)
                flood_fill(h, visited, g, i, j, color, size)
                component_id += 1
    return h
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 09:51:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of height values where cells greater than 4 ("high" cells) form connected components that must be colored using a cycling palette of [4, 3, 1, 2], while low cells (≤4) remain 0 in the output; the goal is to produce an output grid `h` that matches expected colorings for these components. The current program uses flood fill to identify and color 4-connected components in row-major order, but it fails to match expected outputs due to incorrect color assignments for specific components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * High cells (>4) are connected only via 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count, which is correctly implemented but may not explain all mismatches.
 * Components are discovered in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), assigning colors sequentially from the palette; this order leads to wrong colors in expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle may require a different discovery order (e.g., by component size, position, or sorted by starting coordinates) or non-cycling assignment rules.
 * Low cells (≤4) are preserved from the input grid in `h` but appear as 0 in all printed outputs, implying input low cells are already 0 or the printing normalizes them; however, the program correctly avoids overwriting them.
 * Palette cycles every 4 components: ID 0→4, 1→3, 2→1, 3→2, 4→4, etc.; mismatches occur when a component gets a color offset from expected (e.g., a component colored 2 in generated but 4 in expected), indicating ~2 fewer prior components in discovery or a shifted palette start.
 * Subtle element: Some components in expected outputs appear "split" or "merged" differently, but shapes match exactly across generated/expected—differences are purely in color values, not filled positions, so the issue is assignment logic, not connectivity or `is_high`.
 * All components, regardless of size, must be colored if they contain high cells; no omission based on size or holes (no evidence of hole-counting rules).
 * Grid size is square (e.g., 30x30 in examples), and output must exactly replicate expected structure, including isolated high cells as single-cell components.
 * Potential miss: Colors might be assigned based on the minimum row/column of the component's starting cell (e.g., sorted by topmost/leftmost position), or perhaps by component area/size descending, which would reorder discovery and fix color offsets.
 * Visually, outputs resemble "islands" or "blobs" of terrain heights, suggesting a map-coloring puzzle where adjacent blobs get different colors, but the cycling is fixed, not adjacency-based (no conflict resolution needed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def is_high(c: int) -> bool:
    return c > 4
```
(This correctly identifies cells to color; keep it.)

```python
def get_color(component_id: int) -> int:
    palette = [4, 3, 1, 2]
    return palette[component_id % len(palette)]
```
(This implements cycling but may need adjustment, e.g., different palette order [4,1,3,2] or non-modulo logic; currently helpful for basic assignment.)

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and is_high(g[nx][ny]) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
(This performs correct 4-connected BFS flood fill on high cells only; essential and bug-free—keep and reuse.)

(The main `program` function is helpful as a skeleton: it deep-copies `g` to `h`, initializes visited, and iterates to find unvisited high cells, but the row-major iteration order causes color mismatches.)

(No extraction functions like for objects/holes were used or needed; the problem doesn't involve counting holes or extracting separate elements beyond components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and fills all high-cell components with consistent shapes matching expected (no shape errors), but assigns wrong colors due to discovery order—e.g., in Training 1, row 12 columns 12-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 14 columns 9-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 15 columns 9-12 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), suggesting a color offset of 2 for later components.
 * In Training 1, row 16 column 5 is 4 (generated) but 3 (expected); row 17-20 have 4 where expected has 3, indicating early components get shifted colors (e.g., second component colored 4 instead of 3).
 * In Training 2, row 1 columns 18-19 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected); row 2-7 have large 4-block where expected has 2, showing a major color shift for a prominent component; row 14 columns 12-14 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected).
 * In Training 2, row 9 columns 10-12 are 1 (generated) but 2 (expected), a small isolated mismatch possibly from single-cell handling.
 * Overall, component discovery in row-major order works for finding all blobs but fails on color sequencing; no evidence of 8-connectivity needed, as shapes match.
 * Flood fill is efficient and correct (uses BFS via deque, marks visited to avoid overlaps); the issue is upstream in iteration order or palette application.
 * No unhelpful functions present—all provided (is_high, get_color, flood_fill) are relevant, though get_color's palette order may need tweaking (e.g., try [1,2,3,4] or sort starts by min_i then min_j explicitly).
 * Attempt demonstrates understanding of connected components but misses the key subtlety of color assignment rules, leading to consistent but offset colorings across both trainings.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed row-major discovery and cycling logic that failed both trainings, likely producing similar color offsets (e.g., early components may get 4 where expected has 3, or vice versa based on component count).
 * Specific issues: In the test output, a large 3-blob in rows 1-6 columns 1-7 appears overcolored as one component, but if expected splits or reorders it, colors like the 4 in row 4 column 20-22 may be wrong; similarly, the 2-blob in rows 2-4 columns 14-18 looks connected but may need different color if discovery order shifts.
 * The 1-column in rows 0-29 column 24 is consistently 1, which might be correct for an isolated vertical component, but if the palette cycles wrong, it could be expected as 4 or 2.
 * Scattered 4-blobs (e.g., rows 11-16 columns 20-29) dominate late, suggesting they get higher IDs and cycle back incorrectly; the output has mixed 2/4 in row 20-29, which visually resembles terrain islands but mismatches if expected uses position-based coloring.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense as colored high regions but fails the core rule of matching expected color patterns, as seen in trainings—e.g., the 3 in row 7 column 9-11 may be an offset from expected 1 or 2; without input g, hard to verify shapes, but assuming shapes are correct (per trainings), colors are likely wrong.

[2025-10-02 09:51:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty), where the goal is to transform sparse, patterned, or outlined placements of colors into solid, filled blocks or shapes of consistent colors, likely by interpreting scattered high-value cells as frames, checkers, or sparse indicators that need to be densified or replaced to form coherent solid regions. The transformation preserves some existing patterns (like the top solid-like rows in training example 1) but fills in 0s and adjusts high colors to create uniform blocks of lower colors (e.g., 1,2,3,4) in specific geometric arrangements, such as full rows, rectangles, or aligned clusters.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are large (30x30 based on output lists), mostly 0s, with sparse non-zero colors; focus on connected or patterned groups rather than isolated cells.
 * High colors (e.g., max_c like 4 in train 1, 6 in test) appear in sparse or alternating patterns (e.g., checkers in train 1 row 2), which should be resolved into solid blocks of a single lower color, not cycled replacements.
 * Palette extraction should identify unique non-zero, non-max colors (1,2,3 in train 1; 2,3 in train 2), but exclude 1 if no full row of 1s exists—however, this logic fails as it doesn't fill 0s or expand patterns.
 * Full rows of 1s (e.g., row 5 in both trains) are preserved or introduced as dividers/borders; subtle: 1s often form horizontal barriers or solid lines.
 * Patterns like alternating colors (e.g., 3,0,3 in train 1 row 2) become solid (3,3,3), suggesting "fill the gaps" rule for same-color sparse lines or checkers.
 * Blocks must align to form larger shapes: e.g., in train 1 expected, lower sections have rectangular 3s, 4s, 1s, 2s stacked or adjacent; in train 2, vertical/horizontal solids of 2s and 3s.
 * Subtle: Replacements aren't simple (i+j) cycling; instead, entire regions get uniform color (e.g., all 4s in a block), possibly based on majority color or position-based assignment to palette.
 * 0s in between same-color cells must be filled if part of a pattern; isolated high colors may stay or be removed, but connected/sparse groups expand.
 * No full-row-1 check seems universal—train 1 has it, train 2 doesn't emphasize it, but 1s appear in solids anyway.
 * Max color replacement only touches max_c cells, ignoring 0-fills; expected changes many 0s to colors, indicating region detection (e.g., bounding boxes or flood-fill).
 * Consider object extraction: Identify "blobs" (connected components of non-0, ignoring max_c as outlines) and fill their convex hull or minimal bounding rectangle with a palette color.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns stay 0; patterns don't overlap or bleed; test has 4,5,6 suggesting palette [1,4,5?] but needs solid fills like 6->uniform 4 or similar.
 * All non-0 colors < max are palette candidates, but assignment is per-region, not per-cell.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]

                while stack:

                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue

                if size > 0:
                    blobs.append((color, size, max_c_count, positions))
    return blobs

# To fill a bounding box of positions with a single color (helpful for solid blocks)
def fill_region(grid: List[List[int]], positions: List[Tuple[int,int]], fill_color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
    min_i, max_i = min(p[0] for p in positions), max(p[0] for p in positions)
    min_j, max_j = min(p[1] for p in positions), max(p[1] for p in positions)
    for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1):
        for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
            new_grid[i][j] = fill_color  # Overwrite to solid
    return new_grid
```
Note: `extract_blobs` is helpful for detecting regions to fill but needs refinement (e.g., treat max_c as outlines, fill interior 0s). `fill_region` assumes rectangular fill, which matches expected solids but may overfill non-rect shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies max color and basic palette (e.g., [1,2,3] for train 1, excluding 4; [2,3] for train 2, excluding higher), and preserves some top patterns (e.g., rows 1-3 in train 1 match expected).
 * Replacement logic (cycling palette via (i+j) % len(palette) only for max_c cells) works partially for sparse max_c but fails to fill 0s, leading to scattered results instead of solids (e.g., train 1 row 8 generated has isolated 1,2; expected has solid 4,4).
 * has_full_one_row correctly detects row 5 of 1s in train 1 and excludes 1 from palette if absent, but this doesn't help filling and is irrelevant for train 2 where 1s appear in solids without full rows.
 * compute_replacement is unhelpful/broken: (i+j) modulo creates alternating patterns (e.g., train 1 lower generated has mixed 1,2,3,4 instead of uniform blocks like expected's 3,3,3 or 1,1,1,1).
 * No region detection: Program ignores connected components, so it doesn't expand sparse patterns (e.g., train 2 row 2 generated keeps alternating 2,3; expected fills to solid 2s across).
 * Train 1 mismatches in lower half: Generated scatters palette colors into original 0s/max positions (e.g., row 9 has 4,3,1 but isolated; expected has solid 3,3,3), unknown reason but likely due to no fill logic—it's different by not densifying.
 * Train 2 mismatches broadly: Generated introduces wrong placements (e.g., row 1 has 3,2 in position 18-19; expected has 2,2), and fails to create large solids (e.g., row 14 expected has solid 2s and 3s; generated mixes).
 * get_palette excludes 1 correctly sometimes but doesn't use it for filling full rows/blocks.
 * Overall, program only touches max_c cells, but expected changes 0s too, indicating need for blob extraction and filling.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it retains many original 5s and 6s in scattered patterns (e.g., row 2 has mixed 5,6,4; row 3 has long 5s but interrupted), without forming solid blocks like expected in trains (e.g., no uniform 4,5,6 regions).
 * It appears to replace some 6s with palette cycles (possibly [1,4,5]? since 1s in column 24, 4/5/6 mixed elsewhere), but leaves most 5s intact and doesn't fill 0s (e.g., row 0 has isolated 5s and 1; should likely be solid horizontal 5s or similar based on train patterns).
 * Missing solid fills: e.g., row 7 generated has [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,...] with gaps; expected logic would fill to [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,...] or assign uniform color per cluster.
 * Introduces 1s in column 24 across rows, possibly from palette, but they form a vertical line without expansion, unlike train solids; this doesn't match coherent blocks and seems like erroneous per-cell replacement.
 * Lower rows (e.g., row 20) keep sparse 5s without densifying to rectangles, and end with mixed 4s—looks incorrect as it doesn't resolve patterns into uniforms, differing from train expectations where alternates become solids.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where cells with values ≤4 (including 0s and pre-colored 1-4) remain unchanged, while connected components of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored with cycling colors 1-4 based on the order in which the components are first discovered during a raster-order scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The goal is to produce a output grid that matches expected colorings for these components, likely representing some form of blob detection and labeling in a larger puzzle context, such as distinguishing shapes or regions in a nonogram-like or segmentation task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed only from cells >4, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), treating ≤4 cells as barriers that cannot be crossed.
 * Discovery order for assigning colors is strictly raster: scan row 0 left-to-right, then row 1, etc.; the first unvisited >4 cell encountered starts a new component, which gets the next color in cycle (1 for first, 2 for second, 3 for third, 4 for fourth, then back to 1).
 * All cells in a component must be uniformly colored with the assigned color, replacing their original >4 value; no partial coloring or retention of original values.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous in appearance due to ≤4 barriers, but the flood-fill must not leak across them; easy to miss if stack-based fill visits invalid neighbors.
 * Another subtlety: Large horizontal or vertical strips (e.g., entire rows of >4) form single components if connected, but scattered >4 cells separated by ≤4 are separate components discovered independently.
 * Input grids seem to contain pre-existing 1-4 colors in some areas (unchanged), suggesting the puzzle overlays new component coloring only on >4 regions without overwriting existing 1-4.
 * Potential miss: If input has isolated >4 cells or thin shapes, they each get their own color based on discovery position; over-merging components (e.g., via 8-connectivity) would incorrectly combine them.
 * Flood-fill must mark visited to avoid re-coloring; non-recursive stack is fine but must handle bounds correctly.
 * Overall puzzle likely tests understanding of image segmentation: >4 as "foreground" blobs to label sequentially.

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity only
    stack = [(x, y)]
    visited[x][y] = True
    h[x][y] = color
    while stack:
        cx, cy = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_valid(nx, ny, size) and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt uses correct structure for raster-order discovery and 4-connected flood-fill on >4 cells, leaving ≤4 unchanged, which works for basic component detection (e.g., upper regions in training 1 match expected for colors 4,3,1,2 in rows 1-3).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and colors some early-discovered components, like the vertical 4s in row1-3 col1-3, horizontal 3s in row1-3 col5-7, striped 1s in row1-3 col9-13, and long 2s in row1-3 col15-21; also handles full-row 1s in row5 perfectly.
 * What didn't work: Color assignments mismatch for later components due to apparent errors in discovery order or component merging; e.g., in training 1, a small 2x1 component in row8 col10-11 is colored 2 in generated but should be 4 in expected (suggesting it was discovered as the 4th component, not 2nd); similarly, lower-left 3s (rows9-11 col3-6) are correct but adjacent 2s in row10-11 col8-11 become 2s instead of expected 4s, indicating over-merging or skipped components.
 * In training 1, generated incorrectly colors a blob in rows12-16 col20-25 as mixed 4s and 1s, while expected has consistent 1s there, showing flood-fill didn't fully capture the component (possibly due to barriers or visit bugs).
 * In training 2, early components (2s/3s/1s in rows1-6) mostly match, but mid-grid mismatches like row9 col10-12 colored 4 instead of expected 2, and large 3-blob in rows9-25 col20-27 partially correct but with wrong cycling (e.g., row20 col20-24 as 3s but expected has splits into separate 3-components); lower 4s in rows23-27 also mismatched.
 * extract_objects not present in attempt, but could be helpful for debugging: a function to list component sizes/positions before coloring to verify discovery order.
 * The copy_grid and is_valid are helpful and correct; flood_fill is mostly helpful but subtly broken in handling large/irregular shapes (e.g., doesn't fully propagate in L-shapes or around 0-barriers in training 1 lower sections).
 * assign_colors_to_components is the core logic and helpful, but buggy in component ID cycling—perhaps off-by-one in (component_id % 4) + 1, or raster scan misses isolated cells.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, but flood_fill could be improved with queue (BFS) for consistent order vs stack (DFS), though DFS should work if visited is proper.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same logic, coloring >4 regions with 1-4 (e.g., large 3-blob in rows2-7 col1-7, 2s in rows4-6 col20-22, 1s scattered in col24, 4s in col26-28), leaving 0s and presumed pre-4s unchanged, which seems consistent with the attempt's approach.
 * It does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., the sprawling 3 in upper-left might be over-merged (rows2-7 col1-8 includes separated parts via row7 col4-6, but if 0s barrier, should split); similarly, mid-grid 2s in rows9-16 col16-23 appear as one big component but likely should cycle colors for sub-parts like the vertical in row15-16 col16-19 vs horizontal in row12 col13-16.
 * Lower 4s in rows17-30 col26-28 are consistent stripes, but interspersed 1s in col24 suggest correct isolation; however, without expected test output, hard to confirm, but mismatches like irregular 1-blob in rows20-29 col10-24 (jumping around) indicate flood-fill didn't connect properly (e.g., row22 col9-12 as 1s but separated by 0s from row24 col8-11).
 * Overall, test output follows the flawed pattern from training (partial matches in early/simple components, errors in complex/later ones), so likely incorrect in color order/merging; to fix, need to verify input grid's >4 positions mentally—e.g., if test has diagonal >4 connections, 4-connectivity fails.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of height values where cells greater than 4 ("high" cells) form connected components that must be colored using a cycling palette of [4, 3, 1, 2], while low cells (≤4) remain 0 in the output; the goal is to produce an output grid `h` that matches expected colorings for these components. The current program uses flood fill to identify and color 4-connected components in row-major order, but it fails to match expected outputs due to incorrect color assignments for specific components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * High cells (>4) are connected only via 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count, which is correctly implemented but may not explain all mismatches.
 * Components are discovered in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), assigning colors sequentially from the palette; this order leads to wrong colors in expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle may require a different discovery order (e.g., by component size, position, or sorted by starting coordinates) or non-cycling assignment rules.
 * Low cells (≤4) are preserved from the input grid in `h` but appear as 0 in all printed outputs, implying input low cells are already 0 or the printing normalizes them; however, the program correctly avoids overwriting them.
 * Palette cycles every 4 components: ID 0→4, 1→3, 2→1, 3→2, 4→4, etc.; mismatches occur when a component gets a color offset from expected (e.g., a component colored 2 in generated but 4 in expected), indicating ~2 fewer prior components in discovery or a shifted palette start.
 * Subtle element: Some components in expected outputs appear "split" or "merged" differently, but shapes match exactly across generated/expected—differences are purely in color values, not filled positions, so the issue is assignment logic, not connectivity or `is_high`.
 * All components, regardless of size, must be colored if they contain high cells; no omission based on size or holes (no evidence of hole-counting rules).
 * Grid size is square (e.g., 30x30 in examples), and output must exactly replicate expected structure, including isolated high cells as single-cell components.
 * Potential miss: Colors might be assigned based on the minimum row/column of the component's starting cell (e.g., sorted by topmost/leftmost position), or perhaps by component area/size descending, which would reorder discovery and fix color offsets.
 * Visually, outputs resemble "islands" or "blobs" of terrain heights, suggesting a map-coloring puzzle where adjacent blobs get different colors, but the cycling is fixed, not adjacency-based (no conflict resolution needed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def is_high(c: int) -> bool:
    return c > 4
```
(This correctly identifies cells to color; keep it.)

```python
def get_color(component_id: int) -> int:
    palette = [4, 3, 1, 2]
    return palette[component_id % len(palette)]
```
(This implements cycling but may need adjustment, e.g., different palette order [4,1,3,2] or non-modulo logic; currently helpful for basic assignment.)

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and is_high(g[nx][ny]) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
(This performs correct 4-connected BFS flood fill on high cells only; essential and bug-free—keep and reuse.)

(The main `program` function is helpful as a skeleton: it deep-copies `g` to `h`, initializes visited, and iterates to find unvisited high cells, but the row-major iteration order causes color mismatches.)

(No extraction functions like for objects/holes were used or needed; the problem doesn't involve counting holes or extracting separate elements beyond components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and fills all high-cell components with consistent shapes matching expected (no shape errors), but assigns wrong colors due to discovery order—e.g., in Training 1, row 12 columns 12-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 14 columns 9-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 15 columns 9-12 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), suggesting a color offset of 2 for later components.
 * In Training 1, row 16 column 5 is 4 (generated) but 3 (expected); row 17-20 have 4 where expected has 3, indicating early components get shifted colors (e.g., second component colored 4 instead of 3).
 * In Training 2, row 1 columns 18-19 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected); row 2-7 have large 4-block where expected has 2, showing a major color shift for a prominent component; row 14 columns 12-14 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected).
 * In Training 2, row 9 columns 10-12 are 1 (generated) but 2 (expected), a small isolated mismatch possibly from single-cell handling.
 * Overall, component discovery in row-major order works for finding all blobs but fails on color sequencing; no evidence of 8-connectivity needed, as shapes match.
 * Flood fill is efficient and correct (uses BFS via deque, marks visited to avoid overlaps); the issue is upstream in iteration order or palette application.
 * No unhelpful functions present—all provided (is_high, get_color, flood_fill) are relevant, though get_color's palette order may need tweaking (e.g., try [1,2,3,4] or sort starts by min_i then min_j explicitly).
 * Attempt demonstrates understanding of connected components but misses the key subtlety of color assignment rules, leading to consistent but offset colorings across both trainings.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed row-major discovery and cycling logic that failed both trainings, likely producing similar color offsets (e.g., early components may get 4 where expected has 3, or vice versa based on component count).
 * Specific issues: In the test output, a large 3-blob in rows 1-6 columns 1-7 appears overcolored as one component, but if expected splits or reorders it, colors like the 4 in row 4 column 20-22 may be wrong; similarly, the 2-blob in rows 2-4 columns 14-18 looks connected but may need different color if discovery order shifts.
 * The 1-column in rows 0-29 column 24 is consistently 1, which might be correct for an isolated vertical component, but if the palette cycles wrong, it could be expected as 4 or 2.
 * Scattered 4-blobs (e.g., rows 11-16 columns 20-29) dominate late, suggesting they get higher IDs and cycle back incorrectly; the output has mixed 2/4 in row 20-29, which visually resembles terrain islands but mismatches if expected uses position-based coloring.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense as colored high regions but fails the core rule of matching expected color patterns, as seen in trainings—e.g., the 3 in row 7 column 9-11 may be an offset from expected 1 or 2; without input g, hard to verify shapes, but assuming shapes are correct (per trainings), colors are likely wrong.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:08:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns where connected "objects" or blobs (likely defined by cell values above a threshold, such as >4) need to be identified and recolored using a cycling palette of lower colors (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc., derived from colors present in the grid excluding 0 and the maximum value), while strictly preserving all background and low-value patterns (≤4) without overwriting them. The goal appears to be simplifying or solid-filling these high-value blobs to create cleaner, colored shapes without expanding into surrounding areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components (4-directional adjacency) only for cells with values >4; low values (0-4) must remain untouched, including sparse or patterned arrangements like checkerboards, stripes, or isolated cells.
 * Palette is derived from unique colors in the grid that are >0 and < max color; assign colors cyclically to components (e.g., first component gets color 1, second gets 2, cycling back if more components than colors).
 * Do not fill bounding boxes—only recolor the exact cells in each connected component to avoid overwriting preserved low-value areas; this is a critical subtlety, as overfilling creates solid blocks where expected outputs show maintained sparsity or shapes.
 * Grids are square (e.g., 30x30 based on outputs), with 0 as background; high components may be irregular shapes, not rectangles, and filling must match their footprint exactly.
 * Subtle elements: Some "objects" in expected outputs appear to preserve internal low-value holes or patterns (e.g., 0's inside high areas stay 0), but high cells are uniformly recolored; components might touch but not merge if separated by low values; palette order seems sorted ascending (e.g., [1,2,3,...]).
 * Across attempts, note that max color varies (e.g., up to 4 in train1? but >4 threshold assumes higher); test has 1-6, so threshold >4 may work but confirm if it's > max low or fixed.
 * Preserve exact positions: Expected outputs show high areas replaced but low patterns (e.g., dotted lines of 1's or 2's) intact, unlike generated solid fills.
 * Easy to miss: Components are strictly >4 connected; isolated high cells are single-cell components; cycling palette means repeated colors for many components; no modification if no palette or no high components.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    return max((max(row) for row in grid), default=0)
```
(This correctly computes the max color for palette exclusion.)

```python
def get_appearance_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = set()
    palette = []
    for row in grid:
        for c in row:
            if 0 < c < max_c and c not in seen:
                seen.add(c)
                palette.append(c)
    return palette
```
(This extracts a useful palette of intermediate colors, sorted by appearance; helpful for cycling assignments, though may need sorting if order matters.)

```python

    return components
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of >4 cells; uses DFS via stack, captures exact positions without expansion; key for identifying blobs to recolor.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies high components (>4 connected) and derives a palette, but fails by using bounding box filling, which expands recoloring into surrounding low-value areas (e.g., turns sparse patterns into solid blocks).
 * For train1: Generated large solid fills (e.g., full row 5 as all 1's; oversized 4/3/2 blocks in lower half overwriting 0's and patterns), differing from expected where upper patterns match but lower shows sparse recolored blobs (e.g., irregular 4's in rows 8-10, dotted 3's/1's/2's in rows 11-29, no full rows); unknown why palette cycling started with 4/3/1/2 instead of 1/2/3/4, but overfill is main issue.
 * For train2: Generated solid blocks (e.g., extended 1's into rows 1-7; oversized 2's/3's in lower half), differing from expected sparse recoloring (e.g., dotted 2's in rows 1-4, irregular 3's/1's in rows 20-29, no full solid rows); again, bounding box overfill destroys patterns.
 * fill_bounding_box is broken and unhelpful—creates rectangles that ignore component shape and overwrite lows; replace with exact-position filling (e.g., for pos in positions: new_grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] = color).
 * program overall partially works (copies grid, applies per component) but skips exact filling and may cycle palette incorrectly if not sorted.
 * No other attempts provided, but this shows partial understanding: component detection good, but filling/preservation bad.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows large solid blocks (e.g., rows 0-6 mostly 1's with some 5/4/6 intrusions; oversized 5's in rows 9-17; full rows of 6/4 in lower half), which likely overfills bounding boxes and overwrites sparse low patterns (e.g., isolated 1's and 6's in row 0, dotted 6's in row 1), unlike expected training outputs that preserve sparsity (e.g., dotted lines, irregular shapes). This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it homogenizes the grid too much—expected should have recolored high (>4, like 5/6) blobs exactly (e.g., small clusters of uniform color without expansion) while keeping 1/4 patterns intact; unknown exact input but overfill evident from blocky vs. patterned training expects.

[2025-10-02 10:08:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty), where the goal is to transform sparse, patterned, or outlined placements of colors into solid, filled blocks or shapes of consistent colors, likely by interpreting scattered high-value cells as frames, checkers, or sparse indicators that need to be densified or replaced to form coherent solid regions. The transformation preserves some existing patterns (like the top solid-like rows in training example 1) but fills in 0s and adjusts high colors to create uniform blocks of lower colors (e.g., 1,2,3,4) in specific geometric arrangements, such as full rows, rectangles, or aligned clusters.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are large (30x30 based on output lists), mostly 0s, with sparse non-zero colors; focus on connected or patterned groups rather than isolated cells.
 * High colors (e.g., max_c like 4 in train 1, 6 in test) appear in sparse or alternating patterns (e.g., checkers in train 1 row 2), which should be resolved into solid blocks of a single lower color, not cycled replacements.
 * Palette extraction should identify unique non-zero, non-max colors (1,2,3 in train 1; 2,3 in train 2), but exclude 1 if no full row of 1s exists—however, this logic fails as it doesn't fill 0s or expand patterns.
 * Full rows of 1s (e.g., row 5 in both trains) are preserved or introduced as dividers/borders; subtle: 1s often form horizontal barriers or solid lines.
 * Patterns like alternating colors (e.g., 3,0,3 in train 1 row 2) become solid (3,3,3), suggesting "fill the gaps" rule for same-color sparse lines or checkers.
 * Blocks must align to form larger shapes: e.g., in train 1 expected, lower sections have rectangular 3s, 4s, 1s, 2s stacked or adjacent; in train 2, vertical/horizontal solids of 2s and 3s.
 * Subtle: Replacements aren't simple (i+j) cycling; instead, entire regions get uniform color (e.g., all 4s in a block), possibly based on majority color or position-based assignment to palette.
 * 0s in between same-color cells must be filled if part of a pattern; isolated high colors may stay or be removed, but connected/sparse groups expand.
 * No full-row-1 check seems universal—train 1 has it, train 2 doesn't emphasize it, but 1s appear in solids anyway.
 * Max color replacement only touches max_c cells, ignoring 0-fills; expected changes many 0s to colors, indicating region detection (e.g., bounding boxes or flood-fill).
 * Consider object extraction: Identify "blobs" (connected components of non-0, ignoring max_c as outlines) and fill their convex hull or minimal bounding rectangle with a palette color.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns stay 0; patterns don't overlap or bleed; test has 4,5,6 suggesting palette [1,4,5?] but needs solid fills like 6->uniform 4 or similar.
 * All non-0 colors < max are palette candidates, but assignment is per-region, not per-cell.

    min_i, max_i = min(p[0] for p in positions), max(p[0] for p in positions)
    min_j, max_j = min(p[1] for p in positions), max(p[1] for p in positions)
    for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1):
        for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
            new_grid[i][j] = fill_color  # Overwrite to solid
    return new_grid
```
Note: `extract_blobs` is helpful for detecting regions to fill but needs refinement (e.g., treat max_c as outlines, fill interior 0s). `fill_region` assumes rectangular fill, which matches expected solids but may overfill non-rect shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies max color and basic palette (e.g., [1,2,3] for train 1, excluding 4; [2,3] for train 2, excluding higher), and preserves some top patterns (e.g., rows 1-3 in train 1 match expected).
 * Replacement logic (cycling palette via (i+j) % len(palette) only for max_c cells) works partially for sparse max_c but fails to fill 0s, leading to scattered results instead of solids (e.g., train 1 row 8 generated has isolated 1,2; expected has solid 4,4).
 * has_full_one_row correctly detects row 5 of 1s in train 1 and excludes 1 from palette if absent, but this doesn't help filling and is irrelevant for train 2 where 1s appear in solids without full rows.
 * compute_replacement is unhelpful/broken: (i+j) modulo creates alternating patterns (e.g., train 1 lower generated has mixed 1,2,3,4 instead of uniform blocks like expected's 3,3,3 or 1,1,1,1).
 * No region detection: Program ignores connected components, so it doesn't expand sparse patterns (e.g., train 2 row 2 generated keeps alternating 2,3; expected fills to solid 2s across).
 * Train 1 mismatches in lower half: Generated scatters palette colors into original 0s/max positions (e.g., row 9 has 4,3,1 but isolated; expected has solid 3,3,3), unknown reason but likely due to no fill logic—it's different by not densifying.
 * Train 2 mismatches broadly: Generated introduces wrong placements (e.g., row 1 has 3,2 in position 18-19; expected has 2,2), and fails to create large solids (e.g., row 14 expected has solid 2s and 3s; generated mixes).
 * get_palette excludes 1 correctly sometimes but doesn't use it for filling full rows/blocks.
 * Overall, program only touches max_c cells, but expected changes 0s too, indicating need for blob extraction and filling.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it retains many original 5s and 6s in scattered patterns (e.g., row 2 has mixed 5,6,4; row 3 has long 5s but interrupted), without forming solid blocks like expected in trains (e.g., no uniform 4,5,6 regions).
 * It appears to replace some 6s with palette cycles (possibly [1,4,5]? since 1s in column 24, 4/5/6 mixed elsewhere), but leaves most 5s intact and doesn't fill 0s (e.g., row 0 has isolated 5s and 1; should likely be solid horizontal 5s or similar based on train patterns).
 * Missing solid fills: e.g., row 7 generated has [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,...] with gaps; expected logic would fill to [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,...] or assign uniform color per cluster.
 * Introduces 1s in column 24 across rows, possibly from palette, but they form a vertical line without expansion, unlike train solids; this doesn't match coherent blocks and seems like erroneous per-cell replacement.
 * Lower rows (e.g., row 20) keep sparse 5s without densifying to rectangles, and end with mixed 4s—looks incorrect as it doesn't resolve patterns into uniforms, differing from train expectations where alternates become solids.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where cells with values ≤4 (including 0s and pre-colored 1-4) remain unchanged, while connected components of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored with cycling colors 1-4 based on the order in which the components are first discovered during a raster-order scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The goal is to produce a output grid that matches expected colorings for these components, likely representing some form of blob detection and labeling in a larger puzzle context, such as distinguishing shapes or regions in a nonogram-like or segmentation task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed only from cells >4, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), treating ≤4 cells as barriers that cannot be crossed.
 * Discovery order for assigning colors is strictly raster: scan row 0 left-to-right, then row 1, etc.; the first unvisited >4 cell encountered starts a new component, which gets the next color in cycle (1 for first, 2 for second, 3 for third, 4 for fourth, then back to 1).
 * All cells in a component must be uniformly colored with the assigned color, replacing their original >4 value; no partial coloring or retention of original values.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous in appearance due to ≤4 barriers, but the flood-fill must not leak across them; easy to miss if stack-based fill visits invalid neighbors.
 * Another subtlety: Large horizontal or vertical strips (e.g., entire rows of >4) form single components if connected, but scattered >4 cells separated by ≤4 are separate components discovered independently.
 * Input grids seem to contain pre-existing 1-4 colors in some areas (unchanged), suggesting the puzzle overlays new component coloring only on >4 regions without overwriting existing 1-4.
 * Potential miss: If input has isolated >4 cells or thin shapes, they each get their own color based on discovery position; over-merging components (e.g., via 8-connectivity) would incorrectly combine them.
 * Flood-fill must mark visited to avoid re-coloring; non-recursive stack is fine but must handle bounds correctly.
 * Overall puzzle likely tests understanding of image segmentation: >4 as "foreground" blobs to label sequentially.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating original."""
    return deepcopy(g)

def is_valid(x: int, y: int, size: int) -> bool:
    """Check if position (x, y) is within grid bounds [0, size-1]."""
    return 0 <= x < size and 0 <= y < size
```

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], g: List[List[int]], x: int, y: int, color: int, size: int):
    """Non-recursive flood-fill for a 4-connected component of >4 cells, coloring with given color."""
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity only
    stack = [(x, y)]
    visited[x][y] = True
    h[x][y] = color
    while stack:
        cx, cy = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_valid(nx, ny, size) and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt uses correct structure for raster-order discovery and 4-connected flood-fill on >4 cells, leaving ≤4 unchanged, which works for basic component detection (e.g., upper regions in training 1 match expected for colors 4,3,1,2 in rows 1-3).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and colors some early-discovered components, like the vertical 4s in row1-3 col1-3, horizontal 3s in row1-3 col5-7, striped 1s in row1-3 col9-13, and long 2s in row1-3 col15-21; also handles full-row 1s in row5 perfectly.
 * What didn't work: Color assignments mismatch for later components due to apparent errors in discovery order or component merging; e.g., in training 1, a small 2x1 component in row8 col10-11 is colored 2 in generated but should be 4 in expected (suggesting it was discovered as the 4th component, not 2nd); similarly, lower-left 3s (rows9-11 col3-6) are correct but adjacent 2s in row10-11 col8-11 become 2s instead of expected 4s, indicating over-merging or skipped components.
 * In training 1, generated incorrectly colors a blob in rows12-16 col20-25 as mixed 4s and 1s, while expected has consistent 1s there, showing flood-fill didn't fully capture the component (possibly due to barriers or visit bugs).
 * In training 2, early components (2s/3s/1s in rows1-6) mostly match, but mid-grid mismatches like row9 col10-12 colored 4 instead of expected 2, and large 3-blob in rows9-25 col20-27 partially correct but with wrong cycling (e.g., row20 col20-24 as 3s but expected has splits into separate 3-components); lower 4s in rows23-27 also mismatched.
 * extract_objects not present in attempt, but could be helpful for debugging: a function to list component sizes/positions before coloring to verify discovery order.
 * The copy_grid and is_valid are helpful and correct; flood_fill is mostly helpful but subtly broken in handling large/irregular shapes (e.g., doesn't fully propagate in L-shapes or around 0-barriers in training 1 lower sections).
 * assign_colors_to_components is the core logic and helpful, but buggy in component ID cycling—perhaps off-by-one in (component_id % 4) + 1, or raster scan misses isolated cells.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, but flood_fill could be improved with queue (BFS) for consistent order vs stack (DFS), though DFS should work if visited is proper.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same logic, coloring >4 regions with 1-4 (e.g., large 3-blob in rows2-7 col1-7, 2s in rows4-6 col20-22, 1s scattered in col24, 4s in col26-28), leaving 0s and presumed pre-4s unchanged, which seems consistent with the attempt's approach.
 * It does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., the sprawling 3 in upper-left might be over-merged (rows2-7 col1-8 includes separated parts via row7 col4-6, but if 0s barrier, should split); similarly, mid-grid 2s in rows9-16 col16-23 appear as one big component but likely should cycle colors for sub-parts like the vertical in row15-16 col16-19 vs horizontal in row12 col13-16.
 * Lower 4s in rows17-30 col26-28 are consistent stripes, but interspersed 1s in col24 suggest correct isolation; however, without expected test output, hard to confirm, but mismatches like irregular 1-blob in rows20-29 col10-24 (jumping around) indicate flood-fill didn't connect properly (e.g., row22 col9-12 as 1s but separated by 0s from row24 col8-11).
 * Overall, test output follows the flawed pattern from training (partial matches in early/simple components, errors in complex/later ones), so likely incorrect in color order/merging; to fix, need to verify input grid's >4 positions mentally—e.g., if test has diagonal >4 connections, 4-connectivity fails.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of height values where cells greater than 4 ("high" cells) form connected components that must be colored using a cycling palette of [4, 3, 1, 2], while low cells (≤4) remain 0 in the output; the goal is to produce an output grid `h` that matches expected colorings for these components. The current program uses flood fill to identify and color 4-connected components in row-major order, but it fails to match expected outputs due to incorrect color assignments for specific components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * High cells (>4) are connected only via 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count, which is correctly implemented but may not explain all mismatches.
 * Components are discovered in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), assigning colors sequentially from the palette; this order leads to wrong colors in expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle may require a different discovery order (e.g., by component size, position, or sorted by starting coordinates) or non-cycling assignment rules.
 * Low cells (≤4) are preserved from the input grid in `h` but appear as 0 in all printed outputs, implying input low cells are already 0 or the printing normalizes them; however, the program correctly avoids overwriting them.
 * Palette cycles every 4 components: ID 0→4, 1→3, 2→1, 3→2, 4→4, etc.; mismatches occur when a component gets a color offset from expected (e.g., a component colored 2 in generated but 4 in expected), indicating ~2 fewer prior components in discovery or a shifted palette start.
 * Subtle element: Some components in expected outputs appear "split" or "merged" differently, but shapes match exactly across generated/expected—differences are purely in color values, not filled positions, so the issue is assignment logic, not connectivity or `is_high`.
 * All components, regardless of size, must be colored if they contain high cells; no omission based on size or holes (no evidence of hole-counting rules).
 * Grid size is square (e.g., 30x30 in examples), and output must exactly replicate expected structure, including isolated high cells as single-cell components.
 * Potential miss: Colors might be assigned based on the minimum row/column of the component's starting cell (e.g., sorted by topmost/leftmost position), or perhaps by component area/size descending, which would reorder discovery and fix color offsets.
 * Visually, outputs resemble "islands" or "blobs" of terrain heights, suggesting a map-coloring puzzle where adjacent blobs get different colors, but the cycling is fixed, not adjacency-based (no conflict resolution needed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def is_high(c: int) -> bool:
    return c > 4
```
(This correctly identifies cells to color; keep it.)

```python
def get_color(component_id: int) -> int:
    palette = [4, 3, 1, 2]
    return palette[component_id % len(palette)]
```
(This implements cycling but may need adjustment, e.g., different palette order [4,1,3,2] or non-modulo logic; currently helpful for basic assignment.)

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and is_high(g[nx][ny]) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
(This performs correct 4-connected BFS flood fill on high cells only; essential and bug-free—keep and reuse.)

(The main `program` function is helpful as a skeleton: it deep-copies `g` to `h`, initializes visited, and iterates to find unvisited high cells, but the row-major iteration order causes color mismatches.)

(No extraction functions like for objects/holes were used or needed; the problem doesn't involve counting holes or extracting separate elements beyond components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and fills all high-cell components with consistent shapes matching expected (no shape errors), but assigns wrong colors due to discovery order—e.g., in Training 1, row 12 columns 12-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 14 columns 9-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 15 columns 9-12 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), suggesting a color offset of 2 for later components.
 * In Training 1, row 16 column 5 is 4 (generated) but 3 (expected); row 17-20 have 4 where expected has 3, indicating early components get shifted colors (e.g., second component colored 4 instead of 3).
 * In Training 2, row 1 columns 18-19 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected); row 2-7 have large 4-block where expected has 2, showing a major color shift for a prominent component; row 14 columns 12-14 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected).
 * In Training 2, row 9 columns 10-12 are 1 (generated) but 2 (expected), a small isolated mismatch possibly from single-cell handling.
 * Overall, component discovery in row-major order works for finding all blobs but fails on color sequencing; no evidence of 8-connectivity needed, as shapes match.
 * Flood fill is efficient and correct (uses BFS via deque, marks visited to avoid overlaps); the issue is upstream in iteration order or palette application.
 * No unhelpful functions present—all provided (is_high, get_color, flood_fill) are relevant, though get_color's palette order may need tweaking (e.g., try [1,2,3,4] or sort starts by min_i then min_j explicitly).
 * Attempt demonstrates understanding of connected components but misses the key subtlety of color assignment rules, leading to consistent but offset colorings across both trainings.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed row-major discovery and cycling logic that failed both trainings, likely producing similar color offsets (e.g., early components may get 4 where expected has 3, or vice versa based on component count).
 * Specific issues: In the test output, a large 3-blob in rows 1-6 columns 1-7 appears overcolored as one component, but if expected splits or reorders it, colors like the 4 in row 4 column 20-22 may be wrong; similarly, the 2-blob in rows 2-4 columns 14-18 looks connected but may need different color if discovery order shifts.
 * The 1-column in rows 0-29 column 24 is consistently 1, which might be correct for an isolated vertical component, but if the palette cycles wrong, it could be expected as 4 or 2.
 * Scattered 4-blobs (e.g., rows 11-16 columns 20-29) dominate late, suggesting they get higher IDs and cycle back incorrectly; the output has mixed 2/4 in row 20-29, which visually resembles terrain islands but mismatches if expected uses position-based coloring.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense as colored high regions but fails the core rule of matching expected color patterns, as seen in trainings—e.g., the 3 in row 7 column 9-11 may be an offset from expected 1 or 2; without input g, hard to verify shapes, but assuming shapes are correct (per trainings), colors are likely wrong.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns where connected "objects" or blobs (likely defined by cell values above a threshold, such as >4) need to be identified and recolored using a cycling palette of lower colors (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc., derived from colors present in the grid excluding 0 and the maximum value), while strictly preserving all background and low-value patterns (≤4) without overwriting them. The goal appears to be simplifying or solid-filling these high-value blobs to create cleaner, colored shapes without expanding into surrounding areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components (4-directional adjacency) only for cells with values >4; low values (0-4) must remain untouched, including sparse or patterned arrangements like checkerboards, stripes, or isolated cells.
 * Palette is derived from unique colors in the grid that are >0 and < max color; assign colors cyclically to components (e.g., first component gets color 1, second gets 2, cycling back if more components than colors).
 * Do not fill bounding boxes—only recolor the exact cells in each connected component to avoid overwriting preserved low-value areas; this is a critical subtlety, as overfilling creates solid blocks where expected outputs show maintained sparsity or shapes.
 * Grids are square (e.g., 30x30 based on outputs), with 0 as background; high components may be irregular shapes, not rectangles, and filling must match their footprint exactly.
 * Subtle elements: Some "objects" in expected outputs appear to preserve internal low-value holes or patterns (e.g., 0's inside high areas stay 0), but high cells are uniformly recolored; components might touch but not merge if separated by low values; palette order seems sorted ascending (e.g., [1,2,3,...]).
 * Across attempts, note that max color varies (e.g., up to 4 in train1? but >4 threshold assumes higher); test has 1-6, so threshold >4 may work but confirm if it's > max low or fixed.
 * Preserve exact positions: Expected outputs show high areas replaced but low patterns (e.g., dotted lines of 1's or 2's) intact, unlike generated solid fills.
 * Easy to miss: Components are strictly >4 connected; isolated high cells are single-cell components; cycling palette means repeated colors for many components; no modification if no palette or no high components.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    return max((max(row) for row in grid), default=0)
```
(This correctly computes the max color for palette exclusion.)

```python
def get_appearance_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = set()
    palette = []
    for row in grid:
        for c in row:
            if 0 < c < max_c and c not in seen:
                seen.add(c)
                palette.append(c)
    return palette
```
(This extracts a useful palette of intermediate colors, sorted by appearance; helpful for cycling assignments, though may need sorting if order matters.)

```python
def get_high_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    size = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * size for _ in range(size)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if grid[i][j] > 4 and not visited[i][j]:
                positions = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    positions.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and grid[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(positions)
    return components
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of >4 cells; uses DFS via stack, captures exact positions without expansion; key for identifying blobs to recolor.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies high components (>4 connected) and derives a palette, but fails by using bounding box filling, which expands recoloring into surrounding low-value areas (e.g., turns sparse patterns into solid blocks).
 * For train1: Generated large solid fills (e.g., full row 5 as all 1's; oversized 4/3/2 blocks in lower half overwriting 0's and patterns), differing from expected where upper patterns match but lower shows sparse recolored blobs (e.g., irregular 4's in rows 8-10, dotted 3's/1's/2's in rows 11-29, no full rows); unknown why palette cycling started with 4/3/1/2 instead of 1/2/3/4, but overfill is main issue.
 * For train2: Generated solid blocks (e.g., extended 1's into rows 1-7; oversized 2's/3's in lower half), differing from expected sparse recoloring (e.g., dotted 2's in rows 1-4, irregular 3's/1's in rows 20-29, no full solid rows); again, bounding box overfill destroys patterns.
 * fill_bounding_box is broken and unhelpful—creates rectangles that ignore component shape and overwrite lows; replace with exact-position filling (e.g., for pos in positions: new_grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] = color).
 * program overall partially works (copies grid, applies per component) but skips exact filling and may cycle palette incorrectly if not sorted.
 * No other attempts provided, but this shows partial understanding: component detection good, but filling/preservation bad.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows large solid blocks (e.g., rows 0-6 mostly 1's with some 5/4/6 intrusions; oversized 5's in rows 9-17; full rows of 6/4 in lower half), which likely overfills bounding boxes and overwrites sparse low patterns (e.g., isolated 1's and 6's in row 0, dotted 6's in row 1), unlike expected training outputs that preserve sparsity (e.g., dotted lines, irregular shapes). This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it homogenizes the grid too much—expected should have recolored high (>4, like 5/6) blobs exactly (e.g., small clusters of uniform color without expansion) while keeping 1/4 patterns intact; unknown exact input but overfill evident from blocky vs. patterned training expects.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:24:21] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells with values <=4 must be preserved unchanged, while connected components (using 4-connectivity) of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored using a cycling palette of unique colors present in the grid (specifically, colors c where 0 < c < max_color, sorted in descending order), with components discovered and colored in raster order (row-major traversal from top-left). The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, likely representing some form of region segmentation or object recoloring in a larger image puzzle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and flood fill should only traverse and recolor cells where the original grid value g[nx][ny] > 4, ensuring no leakage into <=4 cells.
 * Palette extraction: Compute max_color as the global maximum in the grid; then collect unique colors strictly between 1 and max_color-1 (exclusive of 0 and max_color itself), sort them descending (e.g., if colors 1,2,3,4 and max=5, palette=[4,3,2,1]); cycle through this palette for each new component using component_id % len(palette), defaulting to 1 if palette empty.
 * Discovery order: Components are found and colored in strict raster order—scan rows left-to-right, top-to-bottom; only start a new flood fill on unvisited cells >4 encountered during this scan.
 * Preservation: All cells <=4 (including 0) stay exactly as in input; only >4 cells are overwritten during flood fill.
 * Subtlety: The input grid likely contains high values (>4) that form "blobs" or regions to be unified under one color per component, but the printed outputs suggest the original high values are not shown—focus on matching the expected recoloring patterns.
 * Potential miss: If max_color is low (e.g., 4), palette might be empty or limited, forcing fallback to color 1; ensure seen set correctly filters 0 < c < max_c.
 * Edge case: Grids may have isolated >4 cells or large components spanning multiple areas; raster order means earlier-discovered components get higher palette colors (since descending sort).
 * Another subtlety: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid recoloring the same component multiple times, but since it's BFS from the starting cell, this is handled if implemented correctly—however, mismatches suggest over- or under-flooding in complex shapes.
 * General: Outputs are 30x30 grids (based on list lengths), with many 0s as background; differences often occur in mid-to-lower rows, suggesting issues with later-discovered components or irregular shapes.
 * From attempts: The BFS flood fill works for simple/early components (e.g., top of train1 matches), but fails on irregular or adjacent components, possibly due to incorrect palette cycling or discovery order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy
from collections import deque

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Find the maximum color value in the grid."""
    if not grid or not any(grid):
        return 0
    return max(max(row) for row in grid if row)

def get_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract unique colors between 1 and max_color - 1, sorted descending."""
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = {c for row in grid for c in row if 0 < c < max_c}
    return sorted(seen, reverse=True)
```
These functions are helpful and correct for palette extraction—they accurately compute the cycling colors based on existing low values. Use them in future attempts.

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    """Perform BFS flood fill on >4 connected cells (4-connectivity), coloring with given color."""
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
This flood fill is helpful and mostly correct (BFS with 4-connectivity, bounds checking, condition on g>4)—it succeeds for early/simple components but may fail on shape complexity; retain but verify against expected shapes.

The main program skeleton (deepcopy h=g, raster loop for discovery, cycling color assignment) is a good base but needs debugging for color assignment order.

No other functions from the attempt (e.g., no object extraction) are present or needed yet.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it partially understands the core mechanic of flood-filling >4 components with a cycled palette but fails both training examples.
 * What worked: Top sections of train1 (rows 0-4, 5-7? the solid lines of 4,3,1,2) match expected exactly, indicating correct preservation of <=4, correct early palette cycling (likely [4,3,2,1]), and functional flood fill for initial raster-discovered components.
 * What didn't work in train1: Mismatches start in lower rows (e.g., row 11: generated has a large 2-block where expected has 1's; row 12: generated 4's in positions expected as 1's; row 13: generated 1's shifted vs expected 4's and 1's; row 14: generated 1's where expected 4's; row 15: generated 1's/2's mismatched vs expected 1's/2's placements)—suggests wrong color assignment to later components, possibly due to incorrect component discovery order or palette cycling off-by-one (e.g., assigning 2 instead of 1, or treating separate components as one).
 * What didn't work in train2: More widespread mismatches (e.g., row 1: generated 3's where expected 2's; row 2: generated 3's in a block where expected 2's; rows 4-6: generated 3's/1's shifted vs expected 2's; lower rows like 9-11: generated 2's/3's where expected 3's/2's in different shapes; row 20: generated 1's where expected 3's)—indicates broader issues with component segmentation (e.g., merging adjacent regions incorrectly) or palette application (cycling to wrong colors like 3 instead of 2).
 * Overall: The attempt correctly implements raster order and BFS but likely errs in palette derivation (e.g., if max_c miscomputed, palette might include/exclude wrong colors) or visited tracking (causing partial fills); no evidence of handling empty palette or isolated cells perfectly.
 * Function `program` is the core but broken in color assignment for mid/late components—do not reuse without fixes; `flood_fill` is helpful but verify shapes manually.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but avoid assuming 8-connectivity or including <=4 in fills (easy miss).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the failed trainings (e.g., recoloring >4 cells with palette colors like 6,5,4,1, but likely wrong cycling/order since trainings failed).
 * Specific issues: Upper-left has 5's preserved (correct if <=4, but wait—5>4, so should be recolored; code preserves <=4 only, but output shows 5's in connected blocks, suggesting flood fill didn't trigger or palette includes 5 erroneously); mid-section (rows 8-16) has fragmented 5's/6's/1's that don't unify components cleanly (e.g., row 12 has scattered 6's where a large connected region might be expected to be one color); lower sections (rows 17-29) show 4's/1's/6's in irregular patterns that mismatch the unified blocks in trainings' expecteds (e.g., row 20 has a large 4-block, but adjacent 1's suggest improper segmentation).
 * It partially makes sense for simple areas (e.g., solid 1-row in row 5 preserved if <=4), but overall fails to unify >4 regions consistently—e.g., the 6's in rows 4-6/10-16 appear over-flooded or under-connected compared to expected uniform recoloring; without the test expected, it doesn't align with train patterns (e.g., no clear descending palette cycling visible).
 * To handle test: Ensure palette excludes any >4 originals (only 1 to max-1); debug discovery to catch vertical-spanning components early; the output's mix of high numbers (5,6) suggests the code isn't recoloring all >4 cells, possibly a bug in the condition (code checks g>4 correctly, but maybe input has values ==5 not flooding).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 10:24:30] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

The following interactions and connections are identified as obvious and consistent across **every provided train example** (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in the same way in both cases. No high-level puzzle solution or speculation is included. Connections not present in both trains (e.g., specific color mappings like yellow-for-0, which differ between trains) are excluded. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., pixel counts or bbox positions that do not influence changes) are omitted unless they directly participate in a consistent interaction. Unknowns (e.g., why higher hole counts beyond provided examples are handled differently) are noted as such.

1. **Hole count (property) of orange components ↔ Color and hole count of "example" components**:
   - Orange components' hole count matches the hole count of non-orange "example" components (small solid/outlined squares at the start of each input, with unique hole counts and colors).
   - Interaction: If an orange component's hole count exactly matches an example's hole count, the orange's color changes to the example's color.
   - Effect: This is a direct mapping; multiple oranges with the same hole count all receive the same target color from the matching example.
   - Consistency: Occurs for all matched hole counts in both trains (e.g., holes=0 and holes=1 in Train 2; holes=0,1,2,3 in Train 1).
   - No effect on other properties (bbox, pixels, holes remain identical).
   - Unknown: No consistent explanation for why mappings differ between puzzles (e.g., holes=0 maps to yellow in Train 1 but red in Train 2); treated as puzzle-specific without cross-puzzle interaction.

2. **Hole count (property) of orange components → Presence/absence in output (removal)**:
   - If an orange component's hole count has no matching example component, the entire orange component is removed (absent from output).
   - Interaction: Hole count acts as a "condition" for inclusion; lack of mapping triggers deletion.
   - Effect: The component (including its color, bbox, pixels, holes) is entirely omitted; no partial transformation.
   - Consistency: Seen in both trains for unmatched hole counts (e.g., holes=4 in Train 1; holes=2 in Train 2).
   - Unknown: No consistent rule for what constitutes a "match" beyond exact hole count equality; higher hole counts (≥ provided examples) always result in removal but without further explanation.

3. **Color change transformation (for orange components) → Unchanged properties (bbox, holes, pixels)**:
   - When an orange component's color changes (via hole count mapping), its bbox, holes, and pixels properties remain exactly the same.
   - Interaction: Color is the only modified attribute; other properties are preserved post-transformation.
   - Effect: Output entry mirrors input except for color (e.g., Orange(holes=N, bbox=X, pixels=Y) → [TargetColor](holes=N, bbox=X, pixels=Y)).
   - Consistency: Applies to every transformed orange in both trains; no exceptions or additional changes.

4. **Non-orange components (examples, bars/stacks) → No transformation (unchanged presence and properties)**:
   - Example components (colored squares with specific holes) and frame-like components (e.g., blue horizontal/vertical bars or stacks with holes=0 and full/partial pixel fills) do not interact with oranges or each other.
   - Interaction: These remain static; their color, holes, bbox, and pixels are copied verbatim to output.
   - Effect: No color change, removal, or modification; they "frame" or exemplify without being affected.
   - Consistency: All such components (4 examples + 1 bar in Train 1; 2 examples + 1 blue stack in Train 2) are unchanged in both outputs.

### Notes on Scope
- **No other consistent interactions identified**: Properties like bbox position, pixel count, or shape silhouettes do not influence color changes, removals, or any other effects in both trains (e.g., no position-based transformations; no pixel count → holes effects). Colors of examples do not interact with each other or bars.
- **Components involved**: Only oranges (polyomino-like, varying holes) and examples (small squares, holes=0 to 3 max across trains) show interactions. Bars/stacks (blue, holes=0) are isolated (unchanged but non-interacting). Scattered pixels, letters (e.g., "B"), or other shapes mentioned in general description do not appear in trains and thus have no consistent connections.
- **Consistency check**: All listed items occur identically in both Train 1 and Train 2. Test inputs are not used for identification (as they are not labeled as "train" examples) but show similar structures (e.g., colored non-oranges with holes, blue bars), suggesting potential alignment without confirming cross-application. No forced connections (e.g., no assumed semantic meaning for colors or holes beyond mapping).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 10:25:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

The following interactions and connections are identified as obvious and consistent across **every provided train example** (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in the same way in both cases. No high-level puzzle solution or speculation is included. Connections not present in both trains (e.g., specific color mappings like yellow-for-0, which differ between trains) are excluded. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., pixel counts or bbox positions that do not influence changes) are omitted unless they directly participate in a consistent interaction. Unknowns (e.g., why higher hole counts beyond provided examples are handled differently) are noted as such.

1. **Hole count (property) of orange components ↔ Color and hole count of "example" components**:
   - Orange components' hole count matches the hole count of non-orange "example" components (small solid/outlined squares at the start of each input, with unique hole counts and colors).
   - Interaction: If an orange component's hole count exactly matches an example's hole count, the orange's color changes to the example's color.
   - Effect: This is a direct mapping; multiple oranges with the same hole count all receive the same target color from the matching example.
   - Consistency: Occurs for all matched hole counts in both trains (e.g., holes=0 and holes=1 in Train 2; holes=0,1,2,3 in Train 1).
   - No effect on other properties (bbox, pixels, holes remain identical).
   - Unknown: No consistent explanation for why mappings differ between puzzles (e.g., holes=0 maps to yellow in Train 1 but red in Train 2); treated as puzzle-specific without cross-puzzle interaction.

2. **Hole count (property) of orange components → Presence/absence in output (removal)**:
   - If an orange component's hole count has no matching example component, the entire orange component is removed (absent from output).
   - Interaction: Hole count acts as a "condition" for inclusion; lack of mapping triggers deletion.
   - Effect: The component (including its color, bbox, pixels, holes) is entirely omitted; no partial transformation.
   - Consistency: Seen in both trains for unmatched hole counts (e.g., holes=4 in Train 1; holes=2 in Train 2).
   - Unknown: No consistent rule for what constitutes a "match" beyond exact hole count equality; higher hole counts (≥ provided examples) always result in removal but without further explanation.

3. **Color change transformation (for orange components) → Unchanged properties (bbox, holes, pixels)**:
   - When an orange component's color changes (via hole count mapping), its bbox, holes, and pixels properties remain exactly the same.
   - Interaction: Color is the only modified attribute; other properties are preserved post-transformation.
   - Effect: Output entry mirrors input except for color (e.g., Orange(holes=N, bbox=X, pixels=Y) → [TargetColor](holes=N, bbox=X, pixels=Y)).
   - Consistency: Applies to every transformed orange in both trains; no exceptions or additional changes.

4. **Non-orange components (examples, bars/stacks) → No transformation (unchanged presence and properties)**:
   - Example components (colored squares with specific holes) and frame-like components (e.g., blue horizontal/vertical bars or stacks with holes=0 and full/partial pixel fills) do not interact with oranges or each other.
   - Interaction: These remain static; their color, holes, bbox, and pixels are copied verbatim to output.
   - Effect: No color change, removal, or modification; they "frame" or exemplify without being affected.
   - Consistency: All such components (4 examples + 1 bar in Train 1; 2 examples + 1 blue stack in Train 2) are unchanged in both outputs.

### Notes on Scope
- **No other consistent interactions identified**: Properties like bbox position, pixel count, or shape silhouettes do not influence color changes, removals, or any other effects in both trains (e.g., no position-based transformations; no pixel count → holes effects). Colors of examples do not interact with each other or bars.
- **Components involved**: Only oranges (polyomino-like, varying holes) and examples (small squares, holes=0 to 3 max across trains) show interactions. Bars/stacks (blue, holes=0) are isolated (unchanged but non-interacting). Scattered pixels, letters (e.g., "B"), or other shapes mentioned in general description do not appear in trains and thus have no consistent connections.
- **Consistency check**: All listed items occur identically in both Train 1 and Train 2. Test inputs are not used for identification (as they are not labeled as "train" examples) but show similar structures (e.g., colored non-oranges with holes, blue bars), suggesting potential alignment without confirming cross-application. No forced connections (e.g., no assumed semantic meaning for colors or holes beyond mapping).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:37:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains "key" shapes (connected components of specific height, typically 3, with known colors and hole counts) that define a mapping from the number of holes in a shape to a target color, and this mapping is used to "decode" or recolor special shapes (likely color 5 components) by replacing them with the color corresponding to their hole count from the key. The goal is to output a transformed grid where decoded shapes are recolored appropriately, while leaving other parts unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-zero color; use DFS or stack-based flood fill to find them, tracking positions, bounding box (min/max row/col), height (max_r - min_r + 1), and size (number of cells).
 * Holes are defined as zero cells (empty space) that are fully enclosed; specifically, count individual 0 cells that have exactly 4 neighboring cells belonging to the component (up, down, left, right within bounds). This works for single-cell holes but fails for multi-cell holes (e.g., a 2x2 hole would have no 0 with 4 component neighbors, as inner 0's neighbor other 0's).
 * Key components for mapping are typically those with exact height 3 and not color 5; their hole count maps to their own color (e.g., a height-3 component with 1 hole and color 3 means mapping[1] = 3).
 * Only transform components that are color 5: compute their hole count h, and if h is in the mapping, recolor all cells in that component to mapping[h]; otherwise, set to 0 (erase). Do not transform other colors or non-height-3 keys.
 * Subtlety: The grid may have multiple components per color; ensure components are disjoint. Height is bounding box height, not actual shape height (e.g., a sparse vertical shape might have height 3 but not span all rows). Zeros outside components are background, not holes unless enclosed.
 * Easy to miss: Mapping is one-way (holes to color), and if no matching h, erase (set to 0), but in practice, all 5's should match a key. Grids have consistent width (30 columns here), and outputs must preserve structure (copy input, modify only targeted cells). Potential for diagonal connections? No, 4-way only. Multi-hole shapes or 0-holes (solid) must be handled; keys may include solid (h=0) or holed examples.
 * All considerations: Avoid counting non-enclosed 0's as holes (only those with n==4 component neighbors). Components may touch edges, so no wrapping. If a 0 is on edge, it can't have 4 neighbors anyway. Size may be used for validation (e.g., ignore tiny components), but not in this attempt. Transformed output must match expected exactly, including all 0's and unchanged areas.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements connected component detection with stack-based flood fill, bounding box calculation, and height computation, which works for identifying key shapes and targets.
 * Hole counting works for single-cell enclosed 0's (e.g., detects the hole in the top "3" shape in ex1), but fails for larger/multi-cell holes since no 0 would have exactly 4 component neighbors (unhelpful for complex shapes; do not rely on it without fixes like flood-fill for enclosed regions).
 * Mapping logic uses only height==3 and non-color-5 components, which seems correct for keys (e.g., top of ex1 has height-3 shapes of colors 1,2,3,4 with h=0 or 1), but transformation only applies to color 5, assuming input has 5's in encoded areas.
 * In training example 1, generated output keeps original colors (e.g., 4's in rows 9-11, columns 3-5 and 9-11; 4's in rows 12-16 various positions) where expected changes them to 3's (rows 9-12, cols 3-5), 1's (rows 12-13, cols 20-25; rows 14-16, cols 18-20), and 2's (rows 20-23, cols 13-17), indicating no transformation occurred—likely because those areas are not color 5 in input, or hole counts didn't match mapping (unknown why, but difference is clear: unchanged vs. recolored to match key hole equivalents).
 * In training example 1, other differences: row 17 has 3's in cols 3-5 where expected has 3's (this matched, but isolated); row 19 has 3's where expected has 3's (partial match); row 27 has 4's where expected has 4's (unchanged parts correct), but overall ~70% mismatch in lower grid.
 * In training example 2, generated keeps 2's and 3's in upper/mid (e.g., rows 1-6 unchanged correctly), but lower areas like rows 9-16 have 2's/3's where expected has 3's (rows 9-16, cols 20-27 changed to 3's with holes); row 20 has 2's where expected has 3's (cols 20-24); row 23 has 3's where expected has 3's (partial); differences suggest transformation skipped or mapping wrong (e.g., h=0 mapped incorrectly, unknown reason).
 * In training example 2, bottom rows 23-27 have 3's in generated where expected has 3's in some spots but 0's/2's elsewhere (e.g., row 23 cols 0-3: 0's expected vs. 3's generated—over-transformation?); ~60% mismatch.
 * apply_color_transformation function is helpful for targeted recoloring but sets to 0 if no mapping, which may be correct but leads to mismatches if all should map.
 * The program copies the input grid to out, which is good for preserving unchanged areas, but since transformations fail, outputs resemble input too closely.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding (components and holes) but broken application (no decoding in encoded areas).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be mostly unchanged from what is likely the input, with a vertical column of 1's (rows 0-29, col 24) unchanged, and patterned areas of 8's (rows 1-3, cols 26-28 with hole at row 2 col 27), 6's (rows 7-16, cols 26-28 with multiple single holes like row 8 col 27, row 10 col 27, etc.), and 4's (rows 17-27, cols 26-28 with holes like row 18 col 27) all preserved as-is, suggesting no recoloring happened.
 * If the puzzle requires decoding these patterned areas (assuming they are color 5 in input) based on hole counts matching a key (e.g., the 1's column might be a solid h=0 key implying color 1 for solids), the output should replace the 8/6/4 patterns with colors like 1 or others corresponding to their hole counts (e.g., 8's has 1 hole → map to color with 1 hole from key; 6's has ~4-5 single holes → multi-hole color), but instead they remain, making it invalid.
 * The repetitive height-3 patterns in 8/6/4 suggest they are encoded shapes awaiting transformation, but since only color 5 is targeted, if input uses other colors (e.g., 8,6,4 as "special" instead of 5), nothing changes—likely the core bug, as test mirrors training mismatches.
 * No erasures to 0 where unmapped, and top/bottom empty rows unchanged correctly, but lack of any decoding means it fails the puzzle's intent.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (the only complete example pairs), the following components and properties exhibit consistent interactions or effects across both train examples. These are limited to obvious, direct connections that appear in every case (train 1 and train 2). Irrelevant elements (e.g., black backgrounds, general grid scattering without specific effects) or inconsistent ones (e.g., no uniform role for text elements or maroon/pink/dark red in trains; no consistent vertical bar behavior) are excluded. Only properties that reliably influence or transform others are included. Unknowns are noted where a connection exists but the exact mechanism cannot be fully explained without forcing an interpretation.

#### Components
- **Header shapes**: Small, solid polyominoes (e.g., 3x3-ish bounding boxes, low pixels ~8-18) with unique, consecutive hole counts starting from 0 (e.g., holes=0, then 1, etc.), each in a distinct non-Orange color (yellow, green, blue, red, etc.). Positioned in the top row/area (low y-coordinates, e.g., y=1-3). These do not transform.
- **Body shapes**: Larger or multi-cell Orange-colored polyominoes (uniform orange, varying sizes/positions, holes=0+). Positioned below/after the top row (higher y-coordinates, e.g., y=8+). These transform or are removed.
- **Bars/lines**: Thin, elongated Blue-colored shapes (holes=0, high pixels ~16-30, wide bbox spans e.g., x=0-29 or y=0-29, possibly horizontal/vertical dividers). Positioned mid-scene (e.g., y=5 or x=5). These do not transform.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These effects occur identically in both train examples: unchanged elements stay identical (bbox, pixels, holes, color, position); transformations only affect body shapes and are driven by holes.

1. **Hole count (property of header shapes) ↔ Color (property of header shapes)**:
   - Each header shape's hole count directly defines a mapping to its own color (e.g., holes=0 → yellow in train 1; holes=0 → red in train 2; holes=1 → green in both).
   - This mapping is consistent per example but varies by example (yellow/red for 0; green for 1). It builds a dictionary of hole-to-color associations, used only for body shapes. Max mapped holes = number of header shapes (up to 3 in train 1; 2 in train 2). No effect on header shapes themselves.

2. **Hole count (property of body shapes) → Color (property of body shapes)**:
   - A body shape's hole count selects a color from the header mapping (if exists) and changes the body shape's color to match (e.g., body holes=0 → yellow in train 1, red in train 2; body holes=1 → green in both).
   - Bbox, pixels, and position remain unchanged. Holes remain unchanged.
   - Consistent: All non-removed body shapes recolor this way. No reverse effect (color does not alter holes).

3. **Hole count (property of body shapes) → Existence/presence (of body shapes in output)**:
   - If a body shape's hole count has no header mapping (e.g., holes=2+ in train 2; holes=4 in train 1), the entire shape is removed from the output (no bbox, pixels, etc.).
   - Consistent: Removal happens exactly when hole count exceeds or mismatches available header mappings. This affects ~1 shape per example. No partial removal (whole shape gone). Unknown: Exact threshold (e.g., > max header holes vs. non-consecutive); it consistently removes but mechanism is not fully explainable from data alone.

4. **Color (Orange only) → Transformation eligibility (of body shapes)**:
   - Only Orange-colored shapes in body positions are eligible for recoloring or removal based on holes (as above). Non-Orange shapes (headers, bars) are unaffected.
   - Consistent: No Orange shape remains orange in outputs; all transform or vanish. Non-Oranges (e.g., initial red/green in train 2) stay unchanged regardless of holes.

5. **Position/spatial arrangement → Component classification (header vs. body)**:
   - Low y-positions (e.g., y=1-3) classify shapes as header (if small, non-Orange, low holes); higher y (e.g., y=8+) classify as body (if Orange).
   - Bars have mid Positions (e.g., y=5) but are exempt due to color/shape (Blue, elongated).
   - Consistent: Top-row small non-Oranges define mappings; post-bar Oranges transform. Some overlap (e.g., train 2 large Orange at y=1-7) is treated as body if Orange. No effect on bbox itself.

6. **Bar properties (color=Blue, holes=0, bbox elongated, pixels high) → No transformation**:
   - Bars are consistently kept identical (color, holes, bbox, pixels, position unchanged), regardless of surrounding mappings.
   - Interaction: Their presence acts as a divider (shapes "above" = header, "below" = body), but this is positional (see #5). No effect from/to other components.

#### Non-Interactions / Exclusions
- Pixels and bbox do not cause transformations (they stay fixed; no consistent effect on color/holes/existence).
- No consistent role for other colors (e.g., maroon/pink/dark red only in tests, irrelevant to trains).
- No interactions involving text elements, silhouettes, edges, or movement/sub-elements (e.g., internal dots/holes don't affect color beyond count; no consistent transformation rules).
- Unknown/unexplainable: Why mappings differ per example (e.g., holes=0 is yellow in train 1, red in train 2); consistent effect exists but cause (e.g., puzzle theme?) cannot be determined from data. No forced explanation.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 10:40:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (the only complete example pairs), the following components and properties exhibit consistent interactions or effects across both train examples. These are limited to obvious, direct connections that appear in every case (train 1 and train 2). Irrelevant elements (e.g., black backgrounds, general grid scattering without specific effects) or inconsistent ones (e.g., no uniform role for text elements or maroon/pink/dark red in trains; no consistent vertical bar behavior) are excluded. Only properties that reliably influence or transform others are included. Unknowns are noted where a connection exists but the exact mechanism cannot be fully explained without forcing an interpretation.

#### Components
- **Header shapes**: Small, solid polyominoes (e.g., 3x3-ish bounding boxes, low pixels ~8-18) with unique, consecutive hole counts starting from 0 (e.g., holes=0, then 1, etc.), each in a distinct non-Orange color (yellow, green, blue, red, etc.). Positioned in the top row/area (low y-coordinates, e.g., y=1-3). These do not transform.
- **Body shapes**: Larger or multi-cell Orange-colored polyominoes (uniform orange, varying sizes/positions, holes=0+). Positioned below/after the top row (higher y-coordinates, e.g., y=8+). These transform or are removed.
- **Bars/lines**: Thin, elongated Blue-colored shapes (holes=0, high pixels ~16-30, wide bbox spans e.g., x=0-29 or y=0-29, possibly horizontal/vertical dividers). Positioned mid-scene (e.g., y=5 or x=5). These do not transform.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These effects occur identically in both train examples: unchanged elements stay identical (bbox, pixels, holes, color, position); transformations only affect body shapes and are driven by holes.

1. **Hole count (property of header shapes) ↔ Color (property of header shapes)**:
   - Each header shape's hole count directly defines a mapping to its own color (e.g., holes=0 → yellow in train 1; holes=0 → red in train 2; holes=1 → green in both).
   - This mapping is consistent per example but varies by example (yellow/red for 0; green for 1). It builds a dictionary of hole-to-color associations, used only for body shapes. Max mapped holes = number of header shapes (up to 3 in train 1; 2 in train 2). No effect on header shapes themselves.

2. **Hole count (property of body shapes) → Color (property of body shapes)**:
   - A body shape's hole count selects a color from the header mapping (if exists) and changes the body shape's color to match (e.g., body holes=0 → yellow in train 1, red in train 2; body holes=1 → green in both).
   - Bbox, pixels, and position remain unchanged. Holes remain unchanged.
   - Consistent: All non-removed body shapes recolor this way. No reverse effect (color does not alter holes).

3. **Hole count (property of body shapes) → Existence/presence (of body shapes in output)**:
   - If a body shape's hole count has no header mapping (e.g., holes=2+ in train 2; holes=4 in train 1), the entire shape is removed from the output (no bbox, pixels, etc.).
   - Consistent: Removal happens exactly when hole count exceeds or mismatches available header mappings. This affects ~1 shape per example. No partial removal (whole shape gone). Unknown: Exact threshold (e.g., > max header holes vs. non-consecutive); it consistently removes but mechanism is not fully explainable from data alone.

4. **Color (Orange only) → Transformation eligibility (of body shapes)**:
   - Only Orange-colored shapes in body positions are eligible for recoloring or removal based on holes (as above). Non-Orange shapes (headers, bars) are unaffected.
   - Consistent: No Orange shape remains orange in outputs; all transform or vanish. Non-Oranges (e.g., initial red/green in train 2) stay unchanged regardless of holes.

5. **Position/spatial arrangement → Component classification (header vs. body)**:
   - Low y-positions (e.g., y=1-3) classify shapes as header (if small, non-Orange, low holes); higher y (e.g., y=8+) classify as body (if Orange).
   - Bars have mid Positions (e.g., y=5) but are exempt due to color/shape (Blue, elongated).
   - Consistent: Top-row small non-Oranges define mappings; post-bar Oranges transform. Some overlap (e.g., train 2 large Orange at y=1-7) is treated as body if Orange. No effect on bbox itself.

6. **Bar properties (color=Blue, holes=0, bbox elongated, pixels high) → No transformation**:
   - Bars are consistently kept identical (color, holes, bbox, pixels, position unchanged), regardless of surrounding mappings.
   - Interaction: Their presence acts as a divider (shapes "above" = header, "below" = body), but this is positional (see #5). No effect from/to other components.

#### Non-Interactions / Exclusions
- Pixels and bbox do not cause transformations (they stay fixed; no consistent effect on color/holes/existence).
- No consistent role for other colors (e.g., maroon/pink/dark red only in tests, irrelevant to trains).
- No interactions involving text elements, silhouettes, edges, or movement/sub-elements (e.g., internal dots/holes don't affect color beyond count; no consistent transformation rules).
- Unknown/unexplainable: Why mappings differ per example (e.g., holes=0 is yellow in train 1, red in train 2); consistent effect exists but cause (e.g., puzzle theme?) cannot be determined from data. No forced explanation.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:46:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-8 likely represent colors, 0 is empty, 5 is orange/special) where connected components (blobs) of the same color form "header" keys in the top section that encode mappings based on their shape (specifically, number of enclosed holes/empty spaces), and orange (5) blobs elsewhere must be transformed to match the color from the header with the equivalent hole count; if no match, they become empty (0).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only: up, down, left, right), not diagonal, and must be same color to connect.
 * Header candidates are limited to top-ish rows (min row <=4), exclude orange (5), require size >=5 cells, and are sorted left-to-right by minimum column to assign indices (0,1,2,... for mapping).
 * Hole counting is critical but tricky: it measures fully enclosed empty (0) regions within a component's bounding box, ignoring external empties or those touching other colors; must pad the subgrid to avoid border leaks, treat other colors as barriers (not traversable), and only count original-grid empties as valid holes (not artifacts).
 * Orange components are transformed only if their hole count matches a header index; otherwise, erase to 0; non-orange components stay unchanged.
 * Grid has dividers/bars (full rows of 1's or empties) separating sections (e.g., header, body, examples); preserve these.
 * Subtleties: Bounding box for holes must be tight but padded; flood fill starts from subgrid borders (including padding) to mark exterior empties; unvisited interior 0's that are original empties count as holes; components may span multiple rows/columns irregularly, so min/max row/col must be accurate; multiple oranges may exist, each transformed independently; headers might have holes formed by their own shape or adjacent empties, but not touching edges/other colors in ways that leak.
 * Easy to miss: Offset in subgrid mapping (e.g., sr = gr - minr +1) can shift positions wrongly; flood fill must not cross barriers (other colors=2); hole count=0 might map to first header; candidates might overlap or be mis-sorted if min-col ties; small/irregular oranges might have 0 holes but still need mapping; entire grid is 30 cols wide, variable height; preserve all non-orange, non-transformed cells exactly.
 * Across attempts: No multiple attempts shown, but this single attempt highlights need for robust hole detection (current flood fill buggy, overcounts/underestimates enclosures); consider diagonal leaks? No, 4-connect only; headers may not be solid blocks—holes from internal gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core: Finds all 4-connected components of same color, returns list of (color, list of (r,c) positions)
def find_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # Implementation as in attempt: DFS/stack-based, marks visited, groups by color.
    # This works well—correctly identifies blobs without issues in examples.
    pass  # (full code from attempt is solid, reuse it)
```

```python
# Attempts hole counting via subgrid + flood fill from borders.
# Helpful concept (enclosures via BFS/DFS on empties), but broken in practice: wrong offsets cause position shifts; flood treats padding correctly but miscounts if subgrid too small/large; only counts original 0's, which is good subtlety.
# Partially useful—fix offsets and validation for future.
def compute_holes(grid: List[List[int]], positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # Implementation as in attempt, but buggy (see below).
    pass  # (full code from attempt; debug offsets like offset_r=1, sr mapping)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly identifies components via find_components (blobs extracted accurately in generated outputs, e.g., header bars and body shapes preserved).
 * What worked: Header candidate selection (top rows, size>=5, exclude 5) and left-to-right sorting by min-col; transformation logic for oranges (replace if mapped, else 0); preserves non-oranges/dividers (e.g., full 1-rows intact in both trainings).
 * What didn't work: Hole computation is fundamentally flawed—underestimates or misidentifies enclosures, leading to wrong mappings (e.g., Train 1: orange blob around rows 9-16 should map to 3 based on 1 hole? but generates 1's/4's wrongly; positions shifted, like row9 col3-5 as 3 expected but 1 generated). Train 1 mismatches: row9 col3-5=1 gen vs 3 exp; row10 col2-3,5-6=1 gen vs 3 exp; row11 col8-9=4 gen but exp has 1's elsewhere misplaced; row12 col12-13=4 gen vs exp 4 but surrounding 1's wrong; many oranges not transformed or wrong color (e.g., bottom 4's unchanged, but exp has 3's/1's/2's in body). Train 2 mismatches: row8 col26-27 missing 3's; row9 col10-12=2 gen vs exp 2 but row10 col11-12=2 gen vs exp 2, but body oranges like row19-22 col21-25=3's missing in gen; row23-26 has extra/missing 3's placements (e.g., row23 col4-7=3 exp but absent in gen). Unknown why holes miscomputed—possibly subgrid offsets (offset_r/c=1) cause gr/gc out-of-bounds or wrong mapping, leading to 0 holes for all? Result: mappings empty or wrong (e.g., idx=0 maps nothing, oranges stay 5 or become 0 prematurely).
 * get_header_mapping sorts correctly but relies on bad holes, so empty dict often; transform_orange_components erases oranges without mapping (e.g., Train1 bottom oranges gone to 0, but exp has 2's/1's).
 * compute_holes is broken/not fully helpful (overly complex subgrid with wrong validation—counts non-original empties sometimes; suggest simplify to direct flood on full grid with barriers).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond that; find_components is essential and correct for extracting objects.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it partially transforms some oranges (e.g., col26-28 has 8/6/4 patterns suggesting hole-based mapping to 8,6,4), but many oranges remain 5 or unchanged (e.g., row1-6 col24-25=1's preserved but surrounding 5? implied not transformed; row17-30 col24=1's but body blobs like row18-26 col1-5/25-29 seem partially 4/6 but irregular, missing full enclosures). It looks like incomplete mapping: headers (top 1's, mid 6's/8's?) detected but holes wrong, so some oranges (e.g., sparse 1's in col24) stay, others half-transform (e.g., row8-16 col25=1 but exp likely full color fill); no erasures to 0 visible, suggesting mappings partial but not erasing unmatched. Why not correct: Similar to trainings, hole miscomputation likely assigns wrong indices (e.g., if all headers get 0 holes, only first maps, rest fail); test has more sparse/irregular blobs (e.g., dotted 8's/6's/4's), so bounding box leaks empties not enclosed; output has preserved 5? No, gen shows no 5's, all transformed or 1/0, but patterns don't match expected solid fills (e.g., row2 col26-29=8,8,8,0 vs likely solid 8 block). Account for test's dotted headers (holes from gaps) and vertical oranges needing precise enclosure check.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 10:47:18] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 10:48:25] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), the following are the only consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to obvious, direct effects where one element's property reliably influences another, without speculation, high-level interpretation, or forcing unobservable links. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated positions without effect, pixel counts that do not drive changes, or bboxes that remain static without transformation) are excluded. Inconsistent or absent interactions (e.g., no observed movement, merging, or position-based changes in either train) are not listed. Unknowns are noted where a connection cannot be fully explained without forcing.

#### 1. **Legend Shapes (Top Row Color-Coded Headers) → Orange Polyominoes' Color**
   - **Description**: The legend shapes (initial colored squares or bars with specific hole counts, e.g., Yellow h=0, Green h=1 in Train 1; Red h=0, Green h=1 in Train 2) establish a mapping of hole count to color. This mapping directly determines the color transformation of orange polyominoes.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Each orange polyomino's color is changed to match the legend color associated with its own hole count (e.g., h=0 orange → Yellow in Train 1, Red in Train 2; h=1 orange → Green in both; h=2 orange → Blue in Train 1; h=3 orange → Red in Train 1).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every orange polyomino across both trains (all oranges are affected; non-orange elements like the legend itself or blue bar are unaffected).
   - **Preserved Properties**: Holes, bbox, and pixels remain identical pre- and post-transformation.
   - **Unknown/Limit**: If an orange polyomino's hole count has no matching legend entry (e.g., h=4 in Train 1, h=2 in Train 2), the piece is removed from the output. The reason for removal (e.g., no mapping vs. other effect) is unknown and consistent but unexplained.

#### 2. **Orange Polyominoes' Hole Count → Their Own Color (via Legend Mapping)**
   - **Description**: The hole count property of each orange polyomino interacts with the legend mapping to override its input color (always orange).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Hole count acts as the key property driving color change (e.g., low holes map to earlier legend colors like Yellow/Red; higher holes to later ones like Green/Blue/Red). No other properties (e.g., pixels, bbox) influence this.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to all orange polyominoes in both trains; no exceptions for shape type, size, or position.
   - **Preserved Properties**: As above (holes, bbox, pixels unchanged).
   - **Unknown/Limit**: No interaction observed for hole counts beyond the legend's range; results in removal (as noted).

#### Fixed/Unaffected Elements (No Interactions Observed)
- **Blue Bar (Horizontal or Vertical)**: Always present with h=0, unchanged color (Blue), bbox, holes, and pixels in both trains. No interaction with legend, holes, or oranges; treated as static separator or background element.
- **Legend Shapes Themselves**: Fixed; no color or property changes, and they do not interact with each other or the bar.

#### Excluded/Non-Interacting Elements
- Positions (bbox coordinates): Static across inputs/outputs; no effect on color, holes, or other properties in either train.
- Pixel counts: Preserved but do not influence any transformations or connections.
- Shape silhouettes or edges: No consistent effect on movement, color, or other properties (e.g., no merging or positional shifts observed).
- Other colors (e.g., initial non-orange, non-legend elements): Unaffected and show no interactions.

No other consistent connections (e.g., color-to-position, hole-to-movement, or inter-piece effects) are observable in every example. Test inputs are not analyzed for consistency, as they lack outputs.

[2025-10-02 10:48:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), the following are the only consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to obvious, direct effects where one element's property reliably influences another, without speculation, high-level interpretation, or forcing unobservable links. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated positions without effect, pixel counts that do not drive changes, or bboxes that remain static without transformation) are excluded. Inconsistent or absent interactions (e.g., no observed movement, merging, or position-based changes in either train) are not listed. Unknowns are noted where a connection cannot be fully explained without forcing.

#### 1. **Legend Shapes (Top Row Color-Coded Headers) → Orange Polyominoes' Color**
   - **Description**: The legend shapes (initial colored squares or bars with specific hole counts, e.g., Yellow h=0, Green h=1 in Train 1; Red h=0, Green h=1 in Train 2) establish a mapping of hole count to color. This mapping directly determines the color transformation of orange polyominoes.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Each orange polyomino's color is changed to match the legend color associated with its own hole count (e.g., h=0 orange → Yellow in Train 1, Red in Train 2; h=1 orange → Green in both; h=2 orange → Blue in Train 1; h=3 orange → Red in Train 1).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every orange polyomino across both trains (all oranges are affected; non-orange elements like the legend itself or blue bar are unaffected).
   - **Preserved Properties**: Holes, bbox, and pixels remain identical pre- and post-transformation.
   - **Unknown/Limit**: If an orange polyomino's hole count has no matching legend entry (e.g., h=4 in Train 1, h=2 in Train 2), the piece is removed from the output. The reason for removal (e.g., no mapping vs. other effect) is unknown and consistent but unexplained.

#### 2. **Orange Polyominoes' Hole Count → Their Own Color (via Legend Mapping)**
   - **Description**: The hole count property of each orange polyomino interacts with the legend mapping to override its input color (always orange).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Hole count acts as the key property driving color change (e.g., low holes map to earlier legend colors like Yellow/Red; higher holes to later ones like Green/Blue/Red). No other properties (e.g., pixels, bbox) influence this.
   - **Consistency**: Applies to all orange polyominoes in both trains; no exceptions for shape type, size, or position.
   - **Preserved Properties**: As above (holes, bbox, pixels unchanged).
   - **Unknown/Limit**: No interaction observed for hole counts beyond the legend's range; results in removal (as noted).

#### Fixed/Unaffected Elements (No Interactions Observed)
- **Blue Bar (Horizontal or Vertical)**: Always present with h=0, unchanged color (Blue), bbox, holes, and pixels in both trains. No interaction with legend, holes, or oranges; treated as static separator or background element.
- **Legend Shapes Themselves**: Fixed; no color or property changes, and they do not interact with each other or the bar.

#### Excluded/Non-Interacting Elements
- Positions (bbox coordinates): Static across inputs/outputs; no effect on color, holes, or other properties in either train.
- Pixel counts: Preserved but do not influence any transformations or connections.
- Shape silhouettes or edges: No consistent effect on movement, color, or other properties (e.g., no merging or positional shifts observed).
- Other colors (e.g., initial non-orange, non-legend elements): Unaffected and show no interactions.

No other consistent connections (e.g., color-to-position, hole-to-movement, or inter-piece effects) are observable in every example. Test inputs are not analyzed for consistency, as they lack outputs.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:58:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a legend in the top rows (likely rows 1-3, 0-indexed) of a 30x30 grid maps the number of internal holes (enclosed empty regions) in colored bar segments to specific colors, and the task is to identify connected components of black cells (value 5) in the grid, compute the number of enclosed holes adjacent to each component (empty regions of 0's that do not connect to the grid border), and replace the component with the corresponding color from the legend mapping; if no mapping exists for the hole count, replace with 0 (empty).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend is extracted only from non-black (non-5) colored segments in rows 1-3 that have width >=3, where the color is taken from the first non-zero cell in row 2 of the segment, and the number of holes is the count of 0's strictly between the first and last non-zero cells in row 2 (gaps in the bar represent holes).
 * Black cells (5's) may appear in the legend rows themselves and are part of the puzzle to color, not part of the legend; legend extraction must skip segments where the extracted color is 5 to avoid contaminating the mapping with invalid entries like mapping[some_holes]=5.
 * Connected components of 5's are found via flood-fill (BFS/DFS) across 4 directions (up, down, left, right), treating only 5's as part of the component; other colors (1,2,3, etc.) and 0's block connectivity.
 * Holes are computed per component by identifying all adjacent 0 cells, then performing BFS on each unvisited connected empty region starting from those adjacents; a region is a hole only if its BFS does not reach any border cell (rows/cols 0 or 29), and each such disconnected empty region counts as exactly one hole regardless of size.
 * Empty regions (0's) are global in the sense that visited empties are marked per component's hole computation to avoid double-counting, but only regions adjacent to the specific component are considered (enclosed holes must touch the component).
 * If the hole count is not in the legend mapping, the entire component is set to 0; otherwise, set to the mapped color; existing non-5 cells in the grid (like pre-colored legend bars) are left unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Legend segments are separated by columns where all three rows (1-3) are 0; overlapping or adjacent segments must be handled by advancing col correctly after each.
 * Subtlety: Components may span the legend rows and main puzzle area, forming large connected 5-regions; hole detection must handle complex shapes where some "holes" may connect to the border via external 0's, making them non-holes.
 * Subtlety: The grid is 30x30, borders are rows/cols 0 and 29; empty regions touching these are not holes (open to outside).
 * General: Assume 0 is empty/white background; colors are positive integers (1,2,3,...); 5 is always black to replace; no diagonal connectivity.
 * From attempts: Hole BFS correctly uses deque for efficiency; visited arrays prevent reprocessing; deepcopy ensures input grid isn't modified externally.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core logic for legend extraction, component finding, and hole counting works when no 5's intrude into legend rows.
 * Training example 2 failed: the large connected 5-component spanning rows 1-7 (cols ~14-24) remained as 5's instead of being replaced with 2's; small 5's in row 1 cols 18-19 stayed 5's instead of 2's; row 7 cols 16-20 stayed 5's instead of 2's; this happened because legend extraction included the 5-segment in rows 1-3, setting mapping[0]=5 (or similar), causing the whole component to "color" to 5 and stay unchanged.
 * Other parts of training 2 worked: top-left 2-bar and 3-bar (with gap) were left as-is (pre-colored); bottom 3-blobs were correctly left or not processed (no 5's there); the 1's column was unchanged.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_legend_mapping, compute_holes, program) are core and helpful but buggy in legend skipping 5's; component extraction via BFS is essential and correct.
 * Subtle bug: Global col advancement in legend skips empty columns correctly but doesn't isolate legend from puzzle 5's in rows 1-3.
 * Unknown: Exact mapping for training 2 (likely 0 holes -> 2, 1 hole -> 3 based on bars), but hole count for big blob is probably 0 (no enclosed empties, just open shape), which should map to 2.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: multiple 5-components remain unchanged (e.g., top cluster rows 0-1 cols 9-11 stays 5's; mid-left rows 7-15 cols 9-11? stays 5's; bottom rows 17-28 cols 24? has 5's scattered but should be replaced), indicating same bug as training 2—legend extraction likely included 5-segments, mapping some holes to 5 and leaving components as 5's.
 * Incorrect colorings: Some areas colored to 8 (e.g., row 2 cols 15-18, row 3 col 13-15/19/26-28), 6 (rows 7-16 cols 26-28 with gaps), 4 (rows 17-28 cols 26-28 with gaps), but these may be overzealous mappings from contaminated legend; 1's column (col 24) stays 1's (correct, pre-colored).
 * Expected for test (mentally simulated): Legend likely maps 0->1? (solid bar), 1->8 (one gap), 2->6 (two gaps), 3->4 (three gaps) based on input patterns in rows 1-3; top 5-cluster (rows 0-1 cols 9-11) probably 0 holes -> color 1 but output has 5's (wrong); mid 5's (rows 7-15 cols 9-11?) likely enclosed holes -> 6 or 8 but output 5's (wrong); bottom 5's (rows 17-28 col 24? scattered vertical) probably 0 or 1 hole -> 1 or 8 but output mixes 5's and 4's incorrectly; all 5's should be replaced, no 5's in output.
 * Test highlights subtlety: Multiple separate 5-components with varying hole counts (e.g., some with gaps simulating 1-3 holes); contaminated mapping causes fallback to 5 instead of 0 or correct color.
 * Overall, test output shows incomplete replacement of 5's and possibly wrong colors (e.g., 4's in bottom may be partial, but 5's persistence confirms bug).

[2025-10-02 10:59:12] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 11:00:46] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples (the only complete input-output pairs available), I analyzed for obvious, consistent interactions or effects between elements across **both** trains. Only connections that appear in **every** train example are included. I focused on properties (e.g., holes, color, bbox, pixels) and components (e.g., header-like shapes, linear blocks, scattered polyominoes) that demonstrably interact or affect each other consistently. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., black background, overall grid layout without specific effects) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or transformation explanations are provided—only direct, observable links. Where a potential interaction cannot be consistently explained (e.g., why certain elements are omitted), it is noted as unknown.

#### Core Components Involved in Interactions
- **Header shapes**: Small, colored polyominoes in the top row/section (e.g., Yellow/Red with 0 holes, Green with 1 hole, etc.). These have unique, increasing hole counts (0, 1, 2, 3 in train 1; 0, 1 in train 2). They define consistent pairings.
- **Separator block**: A linear Blue shape with 0 holes (horizontal in train 1 at y=5; more compact/wide in train 2 at y=0-6). Acts as a divider between top and bottom sections.
- **Input polyominoes**: Larger, scattered Orange shapes below the separator (varying holes 0-4 in train 1; 0-2 in train 2). These are the primary transformable elements, with properties like bbox, pixels, and holes.

Other elements (e.g., complex figures like block letters, nested dots, or non-Orange colors in non-header positions) do not appear consistently in the trains or show no interactions, so they are excluded.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are the only connections that hold across both train inputs/outputs. They involve direct effects (e.g., one property influencing another) or linkages (e.g., shared dependencies).

1. **Hole count → Color mapping (via header shapes)**:
   - The hole count property of input polyominoes (Orange shapes) consistently links to color changes in the output.
   - Header shapes provide the mapping: Their own hole count pairs with their color (e.g., 0 holes always pairs with the first header's color—Yellow in train 1, Red in train 2; 1 hole pairs with Green's color in both).
   - Effect: If an input polyomino's holes match a header's holes, its output color changes to that header's color. This is consistent for matching cases (0 or 1 holes in both trains; extends to 2 and 3 in train 1).
   - No effect on header shapes themselves—their colors remain unchanged.
   - Unknown: Why higher hole counts (e.g., 2 in train 2, 4 in train 1) have no mapping or effect; no consistent explanation across trains.

2. **Hole count → Presence/omission in output**:
   - Input polyominoes' hole count affects whether they appear in the output at all.
   - Effect: If holes match a header's holes, the polyomino is retained in output (with color change as above). If no match, it is omitted entirely.
   - Consistent in both trains: Train 1 omits the 4-hole Orange; train 2 omits the 2-hole Orange. Lower holes (0, 1) always retained.
   - No interaction with header or separator presence—they are always retained unchanged.
   - Unknown: The exact threshold for omission (e.g., holes > max header holes?); consistent effect but no explainable mechanism.

3. **Bbox (position) preservation for matching input polyominoes**:
   - The bbox property of input polyominoes directly carries over to output for retained shapes.
   - Effect: Matching input polyominoes (based on holes) appear in the output with identical bbox coordinates, regardless of color change. Order of retained shapes is preserved relative to input.
   - Consistent in both trains: All retained Oranges keep exact bbox (e.g., [8,8,11,11] in train 1; [19,8,28,15] in train 2).
   - No effect on omitted shapes or on header/separator bboxes (they remain unchanged).
   - No position-based transformation (e.g., no movement or scaling observed consistently).

4. **Pixels count preservation**:
   - The pixels property of input polyominoes links directly to output for retained shapes.
   - Effect: Matching input polyominoes retain exact pixel count in output, unaffected by color change.
   - Consistent in both trains: Examples include 15px (train 1, 1-hole), 46px (train 2, 1-hole), 61px (train 2, 0-hole).
   - No interaction with holes or color—pixels are independent but consistently preserved alongside bbox.
   - No effect on header or separator pixels (unchanged).

5. **Separator block → Section division (positional interaction)**:
   - The separator's position (bbox) consistently divides the composition into top (headers) and bottom (input polyominoes) sections.
   - Effect: Elements above/below it do not cross sections in output—headers stay top, input polyominoes stay bottom (with preservations/omissions as above). Separator itself is unchanged (color, holes=0, bbox, pixels).
   - Consistent in both trains: Horizontal in train 1 ([0,5,29,5], 30px); compact in train 2 ([0,0,9,6], 16px). No transformation.
   - No direct effect on colors or holes, but enables consistent separation of interacting components.

6. **Input polyomino color (Orange) → Eligibility for transformation**:
   - All transformable shapes in bottom section are consistently Orange in inputs.
   - Effect: Only Orange shapes interact with the hole-color mapping (change or omit). Non-Orange shapes (e.g., the Blue separator) are unchanged.
   - Consistent in both trains: All bottom inputs are Orange; only they show color changes or omissions based on holes.
   - Unknown: If non-Orange bottom shapes would interact (none present consistently to test).

#### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Excluded for Lack of Consistency)
- No consistent color → holes effect (e.g., input color doesn't alter holes).
- No position → transformation (e.g., bbox doesn't cause movement, scaling, or new shapes across trains).
- No pixels → other properties (e.g., pixels don't influence color, holes, or omission).
- No nested/patterned elements or complex figures interact consistently (absent or irrelevant in trains).
- Header holes are fixed/increasing but do not transform; no feedback effect to inputs.
- No consistent role for other colors (e.g., Blue only in separator; Red/Yellow/etc. only in headers).

These are the only obvious, consistent links. Test inputs introduce new colors (e.g., Maroon, Pink) and structures (e.g., vertical Blues, mixed colors in bottom), but without outputs, no new interactions can be verified against the trains' consistency requirement. If more train pairs were provided, additional links might emerge.

[2025-10-02 11:00:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty), where the goal is to transform sparse, patterned, or outlined placements of colors into solid, filled blocks or shapes of consistent colors, likely by interpreting scattered high-value cells as frames, checkers, or sparse indicators that need to be densified or replaced to form coherent solid regions. The transformation preserves some existing patterns (like the top solid-like rows in training example 1) but fills in 0s and adjusts high colors to create uniform blocks of lower colors (e.g., 1,2,3,4) in specific geometric arrangements, such as full rows, rectangles, or aligned clusters.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are large (30x30 based on output lists), mostly 0s, with sparse non-zero colors; focus on connected or patterned groups rather than isolated cells.
 * High colors (e.g., max_c like 4 in train 1, 6 in test) appear in sparse or alternating patterns (e.g., checkers in train 1 row 2), which should be resolved into solid blocks of a single lower color, not cycled replacements.
 * Palette extraction should identify unique non-zero, non-max colors (1,2,3 in train 1; 2,3 in train 2), but exclude 1 if no full row of 1s exists—however, this logic fails as it doesn't fill 0s or expand patterns.
 * Full rows of 1s (e.g., row 5 in both trains) are preserved or introduced as dividers/borders; subtle: 1s often form horizontal barriers or solid lines.
 * Patterns like alternating colors (e.g., 3,0,3 in train 1 row 2) become solid (3,3,3), suggesting "fill the gaps" rule for same-color sparse lines or checkers.
 * Blocks must align to form larger shapes: e.g., in train 1 expected, lower sections have rectangular 3s, 4s, 1s, 2s stacked or adjacent; in train 2, vertical/horizontal solids of 2s and 3s.
 * Subtle: Replacements aren't simple (i+j) cycling; instead, entire regions get uniform color (e.g., all 4s in a block), possibly based on majority color or position-based assignment to palette.
 * 0s in between same-color cells must be filled if part of a pattern; isolated high colors may stay or be removed, but connected/sparse groups expand.
 * No full-row-1 check seems universal—train 1 has it, train 2 doesn't emphasize it, but 1s appear in solids anyway.
 * Max color replacement only touches max_c cells, ignoring 0-fills; expected changes many 0s to colors, indicating region detection (e.g., bounding boxes or flood-fill).
 * Consider object extraction: Identify "blobs" (connected components of non-0, ignoring max_c as outlines) and fill their convex hull or minimal bounding rectangle with a palette color.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns stay 0; patterns don't overlap or bleed; test has 4,5,6 suggesting palette [1,4,5?] but needs solid fills like 6->uniform 4 or similar.
 * All non-0 colors < max are palette candidates, but assignment is per-region, not per-cell.

```
Note: `extract_blobs` is helpful for detecting regions to fill but needs refinement (e.g., treat max_c as outlines, fill interior 0s). `fill_region` assumes rectangular fill, which matches expected solids but may overfill non-rect shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies max color and basic palette (e.g., [1,2,3] for train 1, excluding 4; [2,3] for train 2, excluding higher), and preserves some top patterns (e.g., rows 1-3 in train 1 match expected).
 * Replacement logic (cycling palette via (i+j) % len(palette) only for max_c cells) works partially for sparse max_c but fails to fill 0s, leading to scattered results instead of solids (e.g., train 1 row 8 generated has isolated 1,2; expected has solid 4,4).
 * has_full_one_row correctly detects row 5 of 1s in train 1 and excludes 1 from palette if absent, but this doesn't help filling and is irrelevant for train 2 where 1s appear in solids without full rows.
 * compute_replacement is unhelpful/broken: (i+j) modulo creates alternating patterns (e.g., train 1 lower generated has mixed 1,2,3,4 instead of uniform blocks like expected's 3,3,3 or 1,1,1,1).
 * No region detection: Program ignores connected components, so it doesn't expand sparse patterns (e.g., train 2 row 2 generated keeps alternating 2,3; expected fills to solid 2s across).
 * Train 1 mismatches in lower half: Generated scatters palette colors into original 0s/max positions (e.g., row 9 has 4,3,1 but isolated; expected has solid 3,3,3), unknown reason but likely due to no fill logic—it's different by not densifying.
 * Train 2 mismatches broadly: Generated introduces wrong placements (e.g., row 1 has 3,2 in position 18-19; expected has 2,2), and fails to create large solids (e.g., row 14 expected has solid 2s and 3s; generated mixes).
 * get_palette excludes 1 correctly sometimes but doesn't use it for filling full rows/blocks.
 * Overall, program only touches max_c cells, but expected changes 0s too, indicating need for blob extraction and filling.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it retains many original 5s and 6s in scattered patterns (e.g., row 2 has mixed 5,6,4; row 3 has long 5s but interrupted), without forming solid blocks like expected in trains (e.g., no uniform 4,5,6 regions).
 * It appears to replace some 6s with palette cycles (possibly [1,4,5]? since 1s in column 24, 4/5/6 mixed elsewhere), but leaves most 5s intact and doesn't fill 0s (e.g., row 0 has isolated 5s and 1; should likely be solid horizontal 5s or similar based on train patterns).
 * Missing solid fills: e.g., row 7 generated has [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,...] with gaps; expected logic would fill to [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,...] or assign uniform color per cluster.
 * Introduces 1s in column 24 across rows, possibly from palette, but they form a vertical line without expansion, unlike train solids; this doesn't match coherent blocks and seems like erroneous per-cell replacement.
 * Lower rows (e.g., row 20) keep sparse 5s without densifying to rectangles, and end with mixed 4s—looks incorrect as it doesn't resolve patterns into uniforms, differing from train expectations where alternates become solids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells with values <=4 must be preserved unchanged, while connected components (using 4-connectivity) of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored using a cycling palette of unique colors present in the grid (specifically, colors c where 0 < c < max_color, sorted in descending order), with components discovered and colored in raster order (row-major traversal from top-left). The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, likely representing some form of region segmentation or object recoloring in a larger image puzzle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and flood fill should only traverse and recolor cells where the original grid value g[nx][ny] > 4, ensuring no leakage into <=4 cells.
 * Palette extraction: Compute max_color as the global maximum in the grid; then collect unique colors strictly between 1 and max_color-1 (exclusive of 0 and max_color itself), sort them descending (e.g., if colors 1,2,3,4 and max=5, palette=[4,3,2,1]); cycle through this palette for each new component using component_id % len(palette), defaulting to 1 if palette empty.
 * Discovery order: Components are found and colored in strict raster order—scan rows left-to-right, top-to-bottom; only start a new flood fill on unvisited cells >4 encountered during this scan.
 * Preservation: All cells <=4 (including 0) stay exactly as in input; only >4 cells are overwritten during flood fill.
 * Subtlety: The input grid likely contains high values (>4) that form "blobs" or regions to be unified under one color per component, but the printed outputs suggest the original high values are not shown—focus on matching the expected recoloring patterns.
 * Potential miss: If max_color is low (e.g., 4), palette might be empty or limited, forcing fallback to color 1; ensure seen set correctly filters 0 < c < max_c.
 * Edge case: Grids may have isolated >4 cells or large components spanning multiple areas; raster order means earlier-discovered components get higher palette colors (since descending sort).
 * Another subtlety: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid recoloring the same component multiple times, but since it's BFS from the starting cell, this is handled if implemented correctly—however, mismatches suggest over- or under-flooding in complex shapes.
 * General: Outputs are 30x30 grids (based on list lengths), with many 0s as background; differences often occur in mid-to-lower rows, suggesting issues with later-discovered components or irregular shapes.
 * From attempts: The BFS flood fill works for simple/early components (e.g., top of train1 matches), but fails on irregular or adjacent components, possibly due to incorrect palette cycling or discovery order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy
from collections import deque

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Find the maximum color value in the grid."""
    if not grid or not any(grid):
        return 0
    return max(max(row) for row in grid if row)

def get_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract unique colors between 1 and max_color - 1, sorted descending."""
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = {c for row in grid for c in row if 0 < c < max_c}
    return sorted(seen, reverse=True)
```
These functions are helpful and correct for palette extraction—they accurately compute the cycling colors based on existing low values. Use them in future attempts.

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    """Perform BFS flood fill on >4 connected cells (4-connectivity), coloring with given color."""
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
This flood fill is helpful and mostly correct (BFS with 4-connectivity, bounds checking, condition on g>4)—it succeeds for early/simple components but may fail on shape complexity; retain but verify against expected shapes.

The main program skeleton (deepcopy h=g, raster loop for discovery, cycling color assignment) is a good base but needs debugging for color assignment order.

No other functions from the attempt (e.g., no object extraction) are present or needed yet.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it partially understands the core mechanic of flood-filling >4 components with a cycled palette but fails both training examples.
 * What worked: Top sections of train1 (rows 0-4, 5-7? the solid lines of 4,3,1,2) match expected exactly, indicating correct preservation of <=4, correct early palette cycling (likely [4,3,2,1]), and functional flood fill for initial raster-discovered components.
 * What didn't work in train1: Mismatches start in lower rows (e.g., row 11: generated has a large 2-block where expected has 1's; row 12: generated 4's in positions expected as 1's; row 13: generated 1's shifted vs expected 4's and 1's; row 14: generated 1's where expected 4's; row 15: generated 1's/2's mismatched vs expected 1's/2's placements)—suggests wrong color assignment to later components, possibly due to incorrect component discovery order or palette cycling off-by-one (e.g., assigning 2 instead of 1, or treating separate components as one).
 * What didn't work in train2: More widespread mismatches (e.g., row 1: generated 3's where expected 2's; row 2: generated 3's in a block where expected 2's; rows 4-6: generated 3's/1's shifted vs expected 2's; lower rows like 9-11: generated 2's/3's where expected 3's/2's in different shapes; row 20: generated 1's where expected 3's)—indicates broader issues with component segmentation (e.g., merging adjacent regions incorrectly) or palette application (cycling to wrong colors like 3 instead of 2).
 * Overall: The attempt correctly implements raster order and BFS but likely errs in palette derivation (e.g., if max_c miscomputed, palette might include/exclude wrong colors) or visited tracking (causing partial fills); no evidence of handling empty palette or isolated cells perfectly.
 * Function `program` is the core but broken in color assignment for mid/late components—do not reuse without fixes; `flood_fill` is helpful but verify shapes manually.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but avoid assuming 8-connectivity or including <=4 in fills (easy miss).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the failed trainings (e.g., recoloring >4 cells with palette colors like 6,5,4,1, but likely wrong cycling/order since trainings failed).
 * Specific issues: Upper-left has 5's preserved (correct if <=4, but wait—5>4, so should be recolored; code preserves <=4 only, but output shows 5's in connected blocks, suggesting flood fill didn't trigger or palette includes 5 erroneously); mid-section (rows 8-16) has fragmented 5's/6's/1's that don't unify components cleanly (e.g., row 12 has scattered 6's where a large connected region might be expected to be one color); lower sections (rows 17-29) show 4's/1's/6's in irregular patterns that mismatch the unified blocks in trainings' expecteds (e.g., row 20 has a large 4-block, but adjacent 1's suggest improper segmentation).
 * It partially makes sense for simple areas (e.g., solid 1-row in row 5 preserved if <=4), but overall fails to unify >4 regions consistently—e.g., the 6's in rows 4-6/10-16 appear over-flooded or under-connected compared to expected uniform recoloring; without the test expected, it doesn't align with train patterns (e.g., no clear descending palette cycling visible).
 * To handle test: Ensure palette excludes any >4 originals (only 1 to max-1); debug discovery to catch vertical-spanning components early; the output's mix of high numbers (5,6) suggests the code isn't recoloring all >4 cells, possibly a bug in the condition (code checks g>4 correctly, but maybe input has values ==5 not flooding).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains "key" shapes (connected components of specific height, typically 3, with known colors and hole counts) that define a mapping from the number of holes in a shape to a target color, and this mapping is used to "decode" or recolor special shapes (likely color 5 components) by replacing them with the color corresponding to their hole count from the key. The goal is to output a transformed grid where decoded shapes are recolored appropriately, while leaving other parts unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-zero color; use DFS or stack-based flood fill to find them, tracking positions, bounding box (min/max row/col), height (max_r - min_r + 1), and size (number of cells).
 * Holes are defined as zero cells (empty space) that are fully enclosed; specifically, count individual 0 cells that have exactly 4 neighboring cells belonging to the component (up, down, left, right within bounds). This works for single-cell holes but fails for multi-cell holes (e.g., a 2x2 hole would have no 0 with 4 component neighbors, as inner 0's neighbor other 0's).
 * Key components for mapping are typically those with exact height 3 and not color 5; their hole count maps to their own color (e.g., a height-3 component with 1 hole and color 3 means mapping[1] = 3).
 * Only transform components that are color 5: compute their hole count h, and if h is in the mapping, recolor all cells in that component to mapping[h]; otherwise, set to 0 (erase). Do not transform other colors or non-height-3 keys.
 * Subtlety: The grid may have multiple components per color; ensure components are disjoint. Height is bounding box height, not actual shape height (e.g., a sparse vertical shape might have height 3 but not span all rows). Zeros outside components are background, not holes unless enclosed.
 * Easy to miss: Mapping is one-way (holes to color), and if no matching h, erase (set to 0), but in practice, all 5's should match a key. Grids have consistent width (30 columns here), and outputs must preserve structure (copy input, modify only targeted cells). Potential for diagonal connections? No, 4-way only. Multi-hole shapes or 0-holes (solid) must be handled; keys may include solid (h=0) or holed examples.
 * All considerations: Avoid counting non-enclosed 0's as holes (only those with n==4 component neighbors). Components may touch edges, so no wrapping. If a 0 is on edge, it can't have 4 neighbors anyway. Size may be used for validation (e.g., ignore tiny components), but not in this attempt. Transformed output must match expected exactly, including all 0's and unchanged areas.

    return h
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements connected component detection with stack-based flood fill, bounding box calculation, and height computation, which works for identifying key shapes and targets.
 * Hole counting works for single-cell enclosed 0's (e.g., detects the hole in the top "3" shape in ex1), but fails for larger/multi-cell holes since no 0 would have exactly 4 component neighbors (unhelpful for complex shapes; do not rely on it without fixes like flood-fill for enclosed regions).
 * Mapping logic uses only height==3 and non-color-5 components, which seems correct for keys (e.g., top of ex1 has height-3 shapes of colors 1,2,3,4 with h=0 or 1), but transformation only applies to color 5, assuming input has 5's in encoded areas.
 * In training example 1, generated output keeps original colors (e.g., 4's in rows 9-11, columns 3-5 and 9-11; 4's in rows 12-16 various positions) where expected changes them to 3's (rows 9-12, cols 3-5), 1's (rows 12-13, cols 20-25; rows 14-16, cols 18-20), and 2's (rows 20-23, cols 13-17), indicating no transformation occurred—likely because those areas are not color 5 in input, or hole counts didn't match mapping (unknown why, but difference is clear: unchanged vs. recolored to match key hole equivalents).
 * In training example 1, other differences: row 17 has 3's in cols 3-5 where expected has 3's (this matched, but isolated); row 19 has 3's where expected has 3's (partial match); row 27 has 4's where expected has 4's (unchanged parts correct), but overall ~70% mismatch in lower grid.
 * In training example 2, generated keeps 2's and 3's in upper/mid (e.g., rows 1-6 unchanged correctly), but lower areas like rows 9-16 have 2's/3's where expected has 3's (rows 9-16, cols 20-27 changed to 3's with holes); row 20 has 2's where expected has 3's (cols 20-24); row 23 has 3's where expected has 3's (partial); differences suggest transformation skipped or mapping wrong (e.g., h=0 mapped incorrectly, unknown reason).
 * In training example 2, bottom rows 23-27 have 3's in generated where expected has 3's in some spots but 0's/2's elsewhere (e.g., row 23 cols 0-3: 0's expected vs. 3's generated—over-transformation?); ~60% mismatch.
 * apply_color_transformation function is helpful for targeted recoloring but sets to 0 if no mapping, which may be correct but leads to mismatches if all should map.
 * The program copies the input grid to out, which is good for preserving unchanged areas, but since transformations fail, outputs resemble input too closely.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding (components and holes) but broken application (no decoding in encoded areas).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be mostly unchanged from what is likely the input, with a vertical column of 1's (rows 0-29, col 24) unchanged, and patterned areas of 8's (rows 1-3, cols 26-28 with hole at row 2 col 27), 6's (rows 7-16, cols 26-28 with multiple single holes like row 8 col 27, row 10 col 27, etc.), and 4's (rows 17-27, cols 26-28 with holes like row 18 col 27) all preserved as-is, suggesting no recoloring happened.
 * If the puzzle requires decoding these patterned areas (assuming they are color 5 in input) based on hole counts matching a key (e.g., the 1's column might be a solid h=0 key implying color 1 for solids), the output should replace the 8/6/4 patterns with colors like 1 or others corresponding to their hole counts (e.g., 8's has 1 hole → map to color with 1 hole from key; 6's has ~4-5 single holes → multi-hole color), but instead they remain, making it invalid.
 * The repetitive height-3 patterns in 8/6/4 suggest they are encoded shapes awaiting transformation, but since only color 5 is targeted, if input uses other colors (e.g., 8,6,4 as "special" instead of 5), nothing changes—likely the core bug, as test mirrors training mismatches.
 * No erasures to 0 where unmapped, and top/bottom empty rows unchanged correctly, but lack of any decoding means it fails the puzzle's intent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-8 likely represent colors, 0 is empty, 5 is orange/special) where connected components (blobs) of the same color form "header" keys in the top section that encode mappings based on their shape (specifically, number of enclosed holes/empty spaces), and orange (5) blobs elsewhere must be transformed to match the color from the header with the equivalent hole count; if no match, they become empty (0).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only: up, down, left, right), not diagonal, and must be same color to connect.
 * Header candidates are limited to top-ish rows (min row <=4), exclude orange (5), require size >=5 cells, and are sorted left-to-right by minimum column to assign indices (0,1,2,... for mapping).
 * Hole counting is critical but tricky: it measures fully enclosed empty (0) regions within a component's bounding box, ignoring external empties or those touching other colors; must pad the subgrid to avoid border leaks, treat other colors as barriers (not traversable), and only count original-grid empties as valid holes (not artifacts).
 * Orange components are transformed only if their hole count matches a header index; otherwise, erase to 0; non-orange components stay unchanged.
 * Grid has dividers/bars (full rows of 1's or empties) separating sections (e.g., header, body, examples); preserve these.
 * Subtleties: Bounding box for holes must be tight but padded; flood fill starts from subgrid borders (including padding) to mark exterior empties; unvisited interior 0's that are original empties count as holes; components may span multiple rows/columns irregularly, so min/max row/col must be accurate; multiple oranges may exist, each transformed independently; headers might have holes formed by their own shape or adjacent empties, but not touching edges/other colors in ways that leak.
 * Easy to miss: Offset in subgrid mapping (e.g., sr = gr - minr +1) can shift positions wrongly; flood fill must not cross barriers (other colors=2); hole count=0 might map to first header; candidates might overlap or be mis-sorted if min-col ties; small/irregular oranges might have 0 holes but still need mapping; entire grid is 30 cols wide, variable height; preserve all non-orange, non-transformed cells exactly.
 * Across attempts: No multiple attempts shown, but this single attempt highlights need for robust hole detection (current flood fill buggy, overcounts/underestimates enclosures); consider diagonal leaks? No, 4-connect only; headers may not be solid blocks—holes from internal gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core: Finds all 4-connected components of same color, returns list of (color, list of (r,c) positions)
def find_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # Implementation as in attempt: DFS/stack-based, marks visited, groups by color.
    # This works well—correctly identifies blobs without issues in examples.
    pass  # (full code from attempt is solid, reuse it)
```

```python
# Attempts hole counting via subgrid + flood fill from borders.
# Helpful concept (enclosures via BFS/DFS on empties), but broken in practice: wrong offsets cause position shifts; flood treats padding correctly but miscounts if subgrid too small/large; only counts original 0's, which is good subtlety.
# Partially useful—fix offsets and validation for future.
def compute_holes(grid: List[List[int]], positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # Implementation as in attempt, but buggy (see below).
    pass  # (full code from attempt; debug offsets like offset_r=1, sr mapping)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly identifies components via find_components (blobs extracted accurately in generated outputs, e.g., header bars and body shapes preserved).
 * What worked: Header candidate selection (top rows, size>=5, exclude 5) and left-to-right sorting by min-col; transformation logic for oranges (replace if mapped, else 0); preserves non-oranges/dividers (e.g., full 1-rows intact in both trainings).
 * What didn't work: Hole computation is fundamentally flawed—underestimates or misidentifies enclosures, leading to wrong mappings (e.g., Train 1: orange blob around rows 9-16 should map to 3 based on 1 hole? but generates 1's/4's wrongly; positions shifted, like row9 col3-5 as 3 expected but 1 generated). Train 1 mismatches: row9 col3-5=1 gen vs 3 exp; row10 col2-3,5-6=1 gen vs 3 exp; row11 col8-9=4 gen but exp has 1's elsewhere misplaced; row12 col12-13=4 gen vs exp 4 but surrounding 1's wrong; many oranges not transformed or wrong color (e.g., bottom 4's unchanged, but exp has 3's/1's/2's in body). Train 2 mismatches: row8 col26-27 missing 3's; row9 col10-12=2 gen vs exp 2 but row10 col11-12=2 gen vs exp 2, but body oranges like row19-22 col21-25=3's missing in gen; row23-26 has extra/missing 3's placements (e.g., row23 col4-7=3 exp but absent in gen). Unknown why holes miscomputed—possibly subgrid offsets (offset_r/c=1) cause gr/gc out-of-bounds or wrong mapping, leading to 0 holes for all? Result: mappings empty or wrong (e.g., idx=0 maps nothing, oranges stay 5 or become 0 prematurely).
 * get_header_mapping sorts correctly but relies on bad holes, so empty dict often; transform_orange_components erases oranges without mapping (e.g., Train1 bottom oranges gone to 0, but exp has 2's/1's).
 * compute_holes is broken/not fully helpful (overly complex subgrid with wrong validation—counts non-original empties sometimes; suggest simplify to direct flood on full grid with barriers).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond that; find_components is essential and correct for extracting objects.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it partially transforms some oranges (e.g., col26-28 has 8/6/4 patterns suggesting hole-based mapping to 8,6,4), but many oranges remain 5 or unchanged (e.g., row1-6 col24-25=1's preserved but surrounding 5? implied not transformed; row17-30 col24=1's but body blobs like row18-26 col1-5/25-29 seem partially 4/6 but irregular, missing full enclosures). It looks like incomplete mapping: headers (top 1's, mid 6's/8's?) detected but holes wrong, so some oranges (e.g., sparse 1's in col24) stay, others half-transform (e.g., row8-16 col25=1 but exp likely full color fill); no erasures to 0 visible, suggesting mappings partial but not erasing unmatched. Why not correct: Similar to trainings, hole miscomputation likely assigns wrong indices (e.g., if all headers get 0 holes, only first maps, rest fail); test has more sparse/irregular blobs (e.g., dotted 8's/6's/4's), so bounding box leaks empties not enclosed; output has preserved 5? No, gen shows no 5's, all transformed or 1/0, but patterns don't match expected solid fills (e.g., row2 col26-29=8,8,8,0 vs likely solid 8 block). Account for test's dotted headers (holes from gaps) and vertical oranges needing precise enclosure check.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where cells with values ≤4 (including 0s and pre-colored 1-4) remain unchanged, while connected components of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored with cycling colors 1-4 based on the order in which the components are first discovered during a raster-order scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The goal is to produce a output grid that matches expected colorings for these components, likely representing some form of blob detection and labeling in a larger puzzle context, such as distinguishing shapes or regions in a nonogram-like or segmentation task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed only from cells >4, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), treating ≤4 cells as barriers that cannot be crossed.
 * Discovery order for assigning colors is strictly raster: scan row 0 left-to-right, then row 1, etc.; the first unvisited >4 cell encountered starts a new component, which gets the next color in cycle (1 for first, 2 for second, 3 for third, 4 for fourth, then back to 1).
 * All cells in a component must be uniformly colored with the assigned color, replacing their original >4 value; no partial coloring or retention of original values.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous in appearance due to ≤4 barriers, but the flood-fill must not leak across them; easy to miss if stack-based fill visits invalid neighbors.
 * Another subtlety: Large horizontal or vertical strips (e.g., entire rows of >4) form single components if connected, but scattered >4 cells separated by ≤4 are separate components discovered independently.
 * Input grids seem to contain pre-existing 1-4 colors in some areas (unchanged), suggesting the puzzle overlays new component coloring only on >4 regions without overwriting existing 1-4.
 * Potential miss: If input has isolated >4 cells or thin shapes, they each get their own color based on discovery position; over-merging components (e.g., via 8-connectivity) would incorrectly combine them.
 * Flood-fill must mark visited to avoid re-coloring; non-recursive stack is fine but must handle bounds correctly.
 * Overall puzzle likely tests understanding of image segmentation: >4 as "foreground" blobs to label sequentially.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt uses correct structure for raster-order discovery and 4-connected flood-fill on >4 cells, leaving ≤4 unchanged, which works for basic component detection (e.g., upper regions in training 1 match expected for colors 4,3,1,2 in rows 1-3).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and colors some early-discovered components, like the vertical 4s in row1-3 col1-3, horizontal 3s in row1-3 col5-7, striped 1s in row1-3 col9-13, and long 2s in row1-3 col15-21; also handles full-row 1s in row5 perfectly.
 * What didn't work: Color assignments mismatch for later components due to apparent errors in discovery order or component merging; e.g., in training 1, a small 2x1 component in row8 col10-11 is colored 2 in generated but should be 4 in expected (suggesting it was discovered as the 4th component, not 2nd); similarly, lower-left 3s (rows9-11 col3-6) are correct but adjacent 2s in row10-11 col8-11 become 2s instead of expected 4s, indicating over-merging or skipped components.
 * In training 1, generated incorrectly colors a blob in rows12-16 col20-25 as mixed 4s and 1s, while expected has consistent 1s there, showing flood-fill didn't fully capture the component (possibly due to barriers or visit bugs).
 * In training 2, early components (2s/3s/1s in rows1-6) mostly match, but mid-grid mismatches like row9 col10-12 colored 4 instead of expected 2, and large 3-blob in rows9-25 col20-27 partially correct but with wrong cycling (e.g., row20 col20-24 as 3s but expected has splits into separate 3-components); lower 4s in rows23-27 also mismatched.
 * extract_objects not present in attempt, but could be helpful for debugging: a function to list component sizes/positions before coloring to verify discovery order.
 * The copy_grid and is_valid are helpful and correct; flood_fill is mostly helpful but subtly broken in handling large/irregular shapes (e.g., doesn't fully propagate in L-shapes or around 0-barriers in training 1 lower sections).
 * assign_colors_to_components is the core logic and helpful, but buggy in component ID cycling—perhaps off-by-one in (component_id % 4) + 1, or raster scan misses isolated cells.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, but flood_fill could be improved with queue (BFS) for consistent order vs stack (DFS), though DFS should work if visited is proper.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same logic, coloring >4 regions with 1-4 (e.g., large 3-blob in rows2-7 col1-7, 2s in rows4-6 col20-22, 1s scattered in col24, 4s in col26-28), leaving 0s and presumed pre-4s unchanged, which seems consistent with the attempt's approach.
 * It does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., the sprawling 3 in upper-left might be over-merged (rows2-7 col1-8 includes separated parts via row7 col4-6, but if 0s barrier, should split); similarly, mid-grid 2s in rows9-16 col16-23 appear as one big component but likely should cycle colors for sub-parts like the vertical in row15-16 col16-19 vs horizontal in row12 col13-16.
 * Lower 4s in rows17-30 col26-28 are consistent stripes, but interspersed 1s in col24 suggest correct isolation; however, without expected test output, hard to confirm, but mismatches like irregular 1-blob in rows20-29 col10-24 (jumping around) indicate flood-fill didn't connect properly (e.g., row22 col9-12 as 1s but separated by 0s from row24 col8-11).
 * Overall, test output follows the flawed pattern from training (partial matches in early/simple components, errors in complex/later ones), so likely incorrect in color order/merging; to fix, need to verify input grid's >4 positions mentally—e.g., if test has diagonal >4 connections, 4-connectivity fails.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of height values where cells greater than 4 ("high" cells) form connected components that must be colored using a cycling palette of [4, 3, 1, 2], while low cells (≤4) remain 0 in the output; the goal is to produce an output grid `h` that matches expected colorings for these components. The current program uses flood fill to identify and color 4-connected components in row-major order, but it fails to match expected outputs due to incorrect color assignments for specific components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * High cells (>4) are connected only via 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count, which is correctly implemented but may not explain all mismatches.
 * Components are discovered in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), assigning colors sequentially from the palette; this order leads to wrong colors in expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle may require a different discovery order (e.g., by component size, position, or sorted by starting coordinates) or non-cycling assignment rules.
 * Low cells (≤4) are preserved from the input grid in `h` but appear as 0 in all printed outputs, implying input low cells are already 0 or the printing normalizes them; however, the program correctly avoids overwriting them.
 * Palette cycles every 4 components: ID 0→4, 1→3, 2→1, 3→2, 4→4, etc.; mismatches occur when a component gets a color offset from expected (e.g., a component colored 2 in generated but 4 in expected), indicating ~2 fewer prior components in discovery or a shifted palette start.
 * Subtle element: Some components in expected outputs appear "split" or "merged" differently, but shapes match exactly across generated/expected—differences are purely in color values, not filled positions, so the issue is assignment logic, not connectivity or `is_high`.
 * All components, regardless of size, must be colored if they contain high cells; no omission based on size or holes (no evidence of hole-counting rules).
 * Grid size is square (e.g., 30x30 in examples), and output must exactly replicate expected structure, including isolated high cells as single-cell components.
 * Potential miss: Colors might be assigned based on the minimum row/column of the component's starting cell (e.g., sorted by topmost/leftmost position), or perhaps by component area/size descending, which would reorder discovery and fix color offsets.
 * Visually, outputs resemble "islands" or "blobs" of terrain heights, suggesting a map-coloring puzzle where adjacent blobs get different colors, but the cycling is fixed, not adjacency-based (no conflict resolution needed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def is_high(c: int) -> bool:
    return c > 4
```
(This correctly identifies cells to color; keep it.)

```python
def get_color(component_id: int) -> int:
    palette = [4, 3, 1, 2]
    return palette[component_id % len(palette)]
```
(This implements cycling but may need adjustment, e.g., different palette order [4,1,3,2] or non-modulo logic; currently helpful for basic assignment.)

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and is_high(g[nx][ny]) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
(This performs correct 4-connected BFS flood fill on high cells only; essential and bug-free—keep and reuse.)

(The main `program` function is helpful as a skeleton: it deep-copies `g` to `h`, initializes visited, and iterates to find unvisited high cells, but the row-major iteration order causes color mismatches.)

(No extraction functions like for objects/holes were used or needed; the problem doesn't involve counting holes or extracting separate elements beyond components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and fills all high-cell components with consistent shapes matching expected (no shape errors), but assigns wrong colors due to discovery order—e.g., in Training 1, row 12 columns 12-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 14 columns 9-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 15 columns 9-12 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), suggesting a color offset of 2 for later components.
 * In Training 1, row 16 column 5 is 4 (generated) but 3 (expected); row 17-20 have 4 where expected has 3, indicating early components get shifted colors (e.g., second component colored 4 instead of 3).
 * In Training 2, row 1 columns 18-19 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected); row 2-7 have large 4-block where expected has 2, showing a major color shift for a prominent component; row 14 columns 12-14 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected).
 * In Training 2, row 9 columns 10-12 are 1 (generated) but 2 (expected), a small isolated mismatch possibly from single-cell handling.
 * Overall, component discovery in row-major order works for finding all blobs but fails on color sequencing; no evidence of 8-connectivity needed, as shapes match.
 * Flood fill is efficient and correct (uses BFS via deque, marks visited to avoid overlaps); the issue is upstream in iteration order or palette application.
 * No unhelpful functions present—all provided (is_high, get_color, flood_fill) are relevant, though get_color's palette order may need tweaking (e.g., try [1,2,3,4] or sort starts by min_i then min_j explicitly).
 * Attempt demonstrates understanding of connected components but misses the key subtlety of color assignment rules, leading to consistent but offset colorings across both trainings.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed row-major discovery and cycling logic that failed both trainings, likely producing similar color offsets (e.g., early components may get 4 where expected has 3, or vice versa based on component count).
 * Specific issues: In the test output, a large 3-blob in rows 1-6 columns 1-7 appears overcolored as one component, but if expected splits or reorders it, colors like the 4 in row 4 column 20-22 may be wrong; similarly, the 2-blob in rows 2-4 columns 14-18 looks connected but may need different color if discovery order shifts.
 * The 1-column in rows 0-29 column 24 is consistently 1, which might be correct for an isolated vertical component, but if the palette cycles wrong, it could be expected as 4 or 2.
 * Scattered 4-blobs (e.g., rows 11-16 columns 20-29) dominate late, suggesting they get higher IDs and cycle back incorrectly; the output has mixed 2/4 in row 20-29, which visually resembles terrain islands but mismatches if expected uses position-based coloring.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense as colored high regions but fails the core rule of matching expected color patterns, as seen in trainings—e.g., the 3 in row 7 column 9-11 may be an offset from expected 1 or 2; without input g, hard to verify shapes, but assuming shapes are correct (per trainings), colors are likely wrong.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns where connected "objects" or blobs (likely defined by cell values above a threshold, such as >4) need to be identified and recolored using a cycling palette of lower colors (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc., derived from colors present in the grid excluding 0 and the maximum value), while strictly preserving all background and low-value patterns (≤4) without overwriting them. The goal appears to be simplifying or solid-filling these high-value blobs to create cleaner, colored shapes without expanding into surrounding areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components (4-directional adjacency) only for cells with values >4; low values (0-4) must remain untouched, including sparse or patterned arrangements like checkerboards, stripes, or isolated cells.
 * Palette is derived from unique colors in the grid that are >0 and < max color; assign colors cyclically to components (e.g., first component gets color 1, second gets 2, cycling back if more components than colors).
 * Do not fill bounding boxes—only recolor the exact cells in each connected component to avoid overwriting preserved low-value areas; this is a critical subtlety, as overfilling creates solid blocks where expected outputs show maintained sparsity or shapes.
 * Grids are square (e.g., 30x30 based on outputs), with 0 as background; high components may be irregular shapes, not rectangles, and filling must match their footprint exactly.
 * Subtle elements: Some "objects" in expected outputs appear to preserve internal low-value holes or patterns (e.g., 0's inside high areas stay 0), but high cells are uniformly recolored; components might touch but not merge if separated by low values; palette order seems sorted ascending (e.g., [1,2,3,...]).
 * Across attempts, note that max color varies (e.g., up to 4 in train1? but >4 threshold assumes higher); test has 1-6, so threshold >4 may work but confirm if it's > max low or fixed.
 * Preserve exact positions: Expected outputs show high areas replaced but low patterns (e.g., dotted lines of 1's or 2's) intact, unlike generated solid fills.
 * Easy to miss: Components are strictly >4 connected; isolated high cells are single-cell components; cycling palette means repeated colors for many components; no modification if no palette or no high components.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    return max((max(row) for row in grid), default=0)
```
(This correctly computes the max color for palette exclusion.)

```python
def get_appearance_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = set()
    palette = []
    for row in grid:
        for c in row:
            if 0 < c < max_c and c not in seen:
                seen.add(c)
                palette.append(c)
    return palette
```
(This extracts a useful palette of intermediate colors, sorted by appearance; helpful for cycling assignments, though may need sorting if order matters.)

```python
def get_high_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    size = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * size for _ in range(size)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if grid[i][j] > 4 and not visited[i][j]:
                positions = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    positions.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and grid[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(positions)
    return components
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of >4 cells; uses DFS via stack, captures exact positions without expansion; key for identifying blobs to recolor.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies high components (>4 connected) and derives a palette, but fails by using bounding box filling, which expands recoloring into surrounding low-value areas (e.g., turns sparse patterns into solid blocks).
 * For train1: Generated large solid fills (e.g., full row 5 as all 1's; oversized 4/3/2 blocks in lower half overwriting 0's and patterns), differing from expected where upper patterns match but lower shows sparse recolored blobs (e.g., irregular 4's in rows 8-10, dotted 3's/1's/2's in rows 11-29, no full rows); unknown why palette cycling started with 4/3/1/2 instead of 1/2/3/4, but overfill is main issue.
 * For train2: Generated solid blocks (e.g., extended 1's into rows 1-7; oversized 2's/3's in lower half), differing from expected sparse recoloring (e.g., dotted 2's in rows 1-4, irregular 3's/1's in rows 20-29, no full solid rows); again, bounding box overfill destroys patterns.
 * fill_bounding_box is broken and unhelpful—creates rectangles that ignore component shape and overwrite lows; replace with exact-position filling (e.g., for pos in positions: new_grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] = color).
 * program overall partially works (copies grid, applies per component) but skips exact filling and may cycle palette incorrectly if not sorted.
 * No other attempts provided, but this shows partial understanding: component detection good, but filling/preservation bad.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows large solid blocks (e.g., rows 0-6 mostly 1's with some 5/4/6 intrusions; oversized 5's in rows 9-17; full rows of 6/4 in lower half), which likely overfills bounding boxes and overwrites sparse low patterns (e.g., isolated 1's and 6's in row 0, dotted 6's in row 1), unlike expected training outputs that preserve sparsity (e.g., dotted lines, irregular shapes). This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it homogenizes the grid too much—expected should have recolored high (>4, like 5/6) blobs exactly (e.g., small clusters of uniform color without expansion) while keeping 1/4 patterns intact; unknown exact input but overfill evident from blocky vs. patterned training expects.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a legend in the top rows (likely rows 1-3, 0-indexed) of a 30x30 grid maps the number of internal holes (enclosed empty regions) in colored bar segments to specific colors, and the task is to identify connected components of black cells (value 5) in the grid, compute the number of enclosed holes adjacent to each component (empty regions of 0's that do not connect to the grid border), and replace the component with the corresponding color from the legend mapping; if no mapping exists for the hole count, replace with 0 (empty).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend is extracted only from non-black (non-5) colored segments in rows 1-3 that have width >=3, where the color is taken from the first non-zero cell in row 2 of the segment, and the number of holes is the count of 0's strictly between the first and last non-zero cells in row 2 (gaps in the bar represent holes).
 * Black cells (5's) may appear in the legend rows themselves and are part of the puzzle to color, not part of the legend; legend extraction must skip segments where the extracted color is 5 to avoid contaminating the mapping with invalid entries like mapping[some_holes]=5.
 * Connected components of 5's are found via flood-fill (BFS/DFS) across 4 directions (up, down, left, right), treating only 5's as part of the component; other colors (1,2,3, etc.) and 0's block connectivity.
 * Holes are computed per component by identifying all adjacent 0 cells, then performing BFS on each unvisited connected empty region starting from those adjacents; a region is a hole only if its BFS does not reach any border cell (rows/cols 0 or 29), and each such disconnected empty region counts as exactly one hole regardless of size.
 * Empty regions (0's) are global in the sense that visited empties are marked per component's hole computation to avoid double-counting, but only regions adjacent to the specific component are considered (enclosed holes must touch the component).
 * If the hole count is not in the legend mapping, the entire component is set to 0; otherwise, set to the mapped color; existing non-5 cells in the grid (like pre-colored legend bars) are left unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Legend segments are separated by columns where all three rows (1-3) are 0; overlapping or adjacent segments must be handled by advancing col correctly after each.
 * Subtlety: Components may span the legend rows and main puzzle area, forming large connected 5-regions; hole detection must handle complex shapes where some "holes" may connect to the border via external 0's, making them non-holes.
 * Subtlety: The grid is 30x30, borders are rows/cols 0 and 29; empty regions touching these are not holes (open to outside).
 * General: Assume 0 is empty/white background; colors are positive integers (1,2,3,...); 5 is always black to replace; no diagonal connectivity.
 * From attempts: Hole BFS correctly uses deque for efficiency; visited arrays prevent reprocessing; deepcopy ensures input grid isn't modified externally.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core logic for legend extraction, component finding, and hole counting works when no 5's intrude into legend rows.
 * Training example 2 failed: the large connected 5-component spanning rows 1-7 (cols ~14-24) remained as 5's instead of being replaced with 2's; small 5's in row 1 cols 18-19 stayed 5's instead of 2's; row 7 cols 16-20 stayed 5's instead of 2's; this happened because legend extraction included the 5-segment in rows 1-3, setting mapping[0]=5 (or similar), causing the whole component to "color" to 5 and stay unchanged.
 * Other parts of training 2 worked: top-left 2-bar and 3-bar (with gap) were left as-is (pre-colored); bottom 3-blobs were correctly left or not processed (no 5's there); the 1's column was unchanged.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_legend_mapping, compute_holes, program) are core and helpful but buggy in legend skipping 5's; component extraction via BFS is essential and correct.
 * Subtle bug: Global col advancement in legend skips empty columns correctly but doesn't isolate legend from puzzle 5's in rows 1-3.
 * Unknown: Exact mapping for training 2 (likely 0 holes -> 2, 1 hole -> 3 based on bars), but hole count for big blob is probably 0 (no enclosed empties, just open shape), which should map to 2.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: multiple 5-components remain unchanged (e.g., top cluster rows 0-1 cols 9-11 stays 5's; mid-left rows 7-15 cols 9-11? stays 5's; bottom rows 17-28 cols 24? has 5's scattered but should be replaced), indicating same bug as training 2—legend extraction likely included 5-segments, mapping some holes to 5 and leaving components as 5's.
 * Incorrect colorings: Some areas colored to 8 (e.g., row 2 cols 15-18, row 3 col 13-15/19/26-28), 6 (rows 7-16 cols 26-28 with gaps), 4 (rows 17-28 cols 26-28 with gaps), but these may be overzealous mappings from contaminated legend; 1's column (col 24) stays 1's (correct, pre-colored).
 * Expected for test (mentally simulated): Legend likely maps 0->1? (solid bar), 1->8 (one gap), 2->6 (two gaps), 3->4 (three gaps) based on input patterns in rows 1-3; top 5-cluster (rows 0-1 cols 9-11) probably 0 holes -> color 1 but output has 5's (wrong); mid 5's (rows 7-15 cols 9-11?) likely enclosed holes -> 6 or 8 but output 5's (wrong); bottom 5's (rows 17-28 col 24? scattered vertical) probably 0 or 1 hole -> 1 or 8 but output mixes 5's and 4's incorrectly; all 5's should be replaced, no 5's in output.
 * Test highlights subtlety: Multiple separate 5-components with varying hole counts (e.g., some with gaps simulating 1-3 holes); contaminated mapping causes fallback to 5 instead of 0 or correct color.
 * Overall, test output shows incomplete replacement of 5's and possibly wrong colors (e.g., 4's in bottom may be partial, but 5's persistence confirms bug).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples (the only complete input-output pairs available), I analyzed for obvious, consistent interactions or effects between elements across **both** trains. Only connections that appear in **every** train example are included. I focused on properties (e.g., holes, color, bbox, pixels) and components (e.g., header-like shapes, linear blocks, scattered polyominoes) that demonstrably interact or affect each other consistently. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., black background, overall grid layout without specific effects) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or transformation explanations are provided—only direct, observable links. Where a potential interaction cannot be consistently explained (e.g., why certain elements are omitted), it is noted as unknown.

#### Core Components Involved in Interactions
- **Header shapes**: Small, colored polyominoes in the top row/section (e.g., Yellow/Red with 0 holes, Green with 1 hole, etc.). These have unique, increasing hole counts (0, 1, 2, 3 in train 1; 0, 1 in train 2). They define consistent pairings.
- **Separator block**: A linear Blue shape with 0 holes (horizontal in train 1 at y=5; more compact/wide in train 2 at y=0-6). Acts as a divider between top and bottom sections.
- **Input polyominoes**: Larger, scattered Orange shapes below the separator (varying holes 0-4 in train 1; 0-2 in train 2). These are the primary transformable elements, with properties like bbox, pixels, and holes.

Other elements (e.g., complex figures like block letters, nested dots, or non-Orange colors in non-header positions) do not appear consistently in the trains or show no interactions, so they are excluded.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are the only connections that hold across both train inputs/outputs. They involve direct effects (e.g., one property influencing another) or linkages (e.g., shared dependencies).

1. **Hole count → Color mapping (via header shapes)**:
   - The hole count property of input polyominoes (Orange shapes) consistently links to color changes in the output.
   - Header shapes provide the mapping: Their own hole count pairs with their color (e.g., 0 holes always pairs with the first header's color—Yellow in train 1, Red in train 2; 1 hole pairs with Green's color in both).
   - Effect: If an input polyomino's holes match a header's holes, its output color changes to that header's color. This is consistent for matching cases (0 or 1 holes in both trains; extends to 2 and 3 in train 1).
   - No effect on header shapes themselves—their colors remain unchanged.
   - Unknown: Why higher hole counts (e.g., 2 in train 2, 4 in train 1) have no mapping or effect; no consistent explanation across trains.

2. **Hole count → Presence/omission in output**:
   - Input polyominoes' hole count affects whether they appear in the output at all.
   - Effect: If holes match a header's holes, the polyomino is retained in output (with color change as above). If no match, it is omitted entirely.
   - Consistent in both trains: Train 1 omits the 4-hole Orange; train 2 omits the 2-hole Orange. Lower holes (0, 1) always retained.
   - No interaction with header or separator presence—they are always retained unchanged.
   - Unknown: The exact threshold for omission (e.g., holes > max header holes?); consistent effect but no explainable mechanism.

3. **Bbox (position) preservation for matching input polyominoes**:
   - The bbox property of input polyominoes directly carries over to output for retained shapes.
   - Effect: Matching input polyominoes (based on holes) appear in the output with identical bbox coordinates, regardless of color change. Order of retained shapes is preserved relative to input.
   - Consistent in both trains: All retained Oranges keep exact bbox (e.g., [8,8,11,11] in train 1; [19,8,28,15] in train 2).
   - No effect on omitted shapes or on header/separator bboxes (they remain unchanged).
   - No position-based transformation (e.g., no movement or scaling observed consistently).

4. **Pixels count preservation**:
   - The pixels property of input polyominoes links directly to output for retained shapes.
   - Effect: Matching input polyominoes retain exact pixel count in output, unaffected by color change.
   - Consistent in both trains: Examples include 15px (train 1, 1-hole), 46px (train 2, 1-hole), 61px (train 2, 0-hole).
   - No interaction with holes or color—pixels are independent but consistently preserved alongside bbox.
   - No effect on header or separator pixels (unchanged).

5. **Separator block → Section division (positional interaction)**:
   - The separator's position (bbox) consistently divides the composition into top (headers) and bottom (input polyominoes) sections.
   - Effect: Elements above/below it do not cross sections in output—headers stay top, input polyominoes stay bottom (with preservations/omissions as above). Separator itself is unchanged (color, holes=0, bbox, pixels).
   - Consistent in both trains: Horizontal in train 1 ([0,5,29,5], 30px); compact in train 2 ([0,0,9,6], 16px). No transformation.
   - No direct effect on colors or holes, but enables consistent separation of interacting components.

6. **Input polyomino color (Orange) → Eligibility for transformation**:
   - All transformable shapes in bottom section are consistently Orange in inputs.
   - Effect: Only Orange shapes interact with the hole-color mapping (change or omit). Non-Orange shapes (e.g., the Blue separator) are unchanged.
   - Consistent in both trains: All bottom inputs are Orange; only they show color changes or omissions based on holes.
   - Unknown: If non-Orange bottom shapes would interact (none present consistently to test).

#### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Excluded for Lack of Consistency)
- No consistent color → holes effect (e.g., input color doesn't alter holes).
- No position → transformation (e.g., bbox doesn't cause movement, scaling, or new shapes across trains).
- No pixels → other properties (e.g., pixels don't influence color, holes, or omission).
- No nested/patterned elements or complex figures interact consistently (absent or irrelevant in trains).
- Header holes are fixed/increasing but do not transform; no feedback effect to inputs.
- No consistent role for other colors (e.g., Blue only in separator; Red/Yellow/etc. only in headers).

These are the only obvious, consistent links. Test inputs introduce new colors (e.g., Maroon, Pink) and structures (e.g., vertical Blues, mixed colors in bottom), but without outputs, no new interactions can be verified against the trains' consistency requirement. If more train pairs were provided, additional links might emerge.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:05:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains a legend in the top rows (specifically rows 1-3) that maps the number of internal holes (gaps in a sequence) to specific colors, and the main task is to identify connected components (blobs) of the color 5 in the rest of the grid, count their enclosed empty (0) spaces that do not connect to the grid border, and recolor each blob with the corresponding color from the legend based on the hole count (or to 0 if no mapping exists).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend is extracted only from rows 1, 2, and 3; it ignores columns where all three rows are 0 and processes horizontal stretches of at least 3 consecutive columns with non-zero values in those rows.
 * In the legend, the number of holes is counted as the zeros in row 2 between the first and last non-zero cell in that stretch (ignoring single-cell or no-hole cases, and skipping color 5 entirely).
 * Blobs are 4-way connected components of exactly color 5; other colors (like dividers as 1's or pre-colored legend elements) are left unchanged.
 * Hole counting for blobs identifies fully enclosed empty (0) regions adjacent to the blob that do not reach any grid border, using flood-fill from adjacent 0's and checking if the flood reaches the edge; each such disconnected empty component counts as one hole (not the size of the empty area).
 * The grid size can vary but must be at least 4 for legend processing; copy the grid to avoid modifying the input.
 * Subtlety: Holes in legend are linear gaps in row 2, while blob holes are 2D enclosed areas; ensure flood-fill marks visited empties to avoid double-counting.
 * Subtlety: Blobs with 0 holes or unmapped hole counts become 0 (erased); legend skips invalid stretches (width <3, no gaps, or color 5).
 * Consider border-reaching empties as not holes (they are "open" spaces); multiple disconnected enclosed empties per blob each count separately.
 * Dividers (e.g., vertical column of 1's) and pre-existing non-5 colors (e.g., legend colors like 4,6,8) remain unchanged.
 * Grid is square (N x N), with left side often empty (all 0's) and right side containing the blobs separated by a divider.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def get_size(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return len(grid)
```
Basic utility to get grid dimensions.

```python
def get_legend_mapping(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    # Extracts mapping from rows 1-3: skips empty columns, processes stretches >=3 wide,
    # counts zeros in row 2 between first/last non-zero as num_holes, maps to color from row 2.
    # Skips if no gaps, single cell, or color==5.
    size = get_size(grid)
    if size < 4:
        return {}
    r1 = grid[1]
    r2 = grid[2]
    r3 = grid[3]
    mapping: Dict[int, int] = {}
    col = 0
    while col < size:
        while col < size and r1[col] == 0 and r2[col] == 0 and r3[col] == 0:
            col += 1
        if col >= size:
            break
        start_col = col
        while col < size and not (r1[col] == 0 and r2[col] == 0 and r3[col] == 0):
            col += 1
        end_col = col - 1
        width = end_col - start_col + 1
        if width < 3:
            col = end_col + 1
            continue
        first = -1
        last = -1
        for c in range(start_col, end_col + 1):
            if r2[c] != 0:
                if first == -1:
                    first = c
                last = c
        if first == -1 or first == last:
            col = end_col + 1
            continue
        color = r2[first]
        if color == 5:
            col = end_col + 1
            continue
        num_holes = sum(1 for c in range(first + 1, last) if r2[c] == 0)
        mapping[num_holes] = color
        col = end_col + 1
    return mapping
```
Helpful for parsing the linear hole representation in the legend; correctly handles skipping invalid legend entries.

```python
def compute_holes(grid: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # Counts enclosed 0-regions adjacent to the blob that don't reach border.
    size = get_size(grid)
    empty_visited = [[False for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    hole_count = 0
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    for x, y in component:
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and not empty_visited[nx][ny]:
                q = deque([(nx, ny)])
                empty_visited[nx][ny] = True
                reaches_border = False
                while q:
                    a, b = q.popleft()
                    if a == 0 or a == size - 1 or b == 0 or b == size - 1:
                        reaches_border = True
                    for ddx, ddy in directions:
                        na = a + ddx
                        nb = b + ddy
                        if 0 <= na < size and 0 <= nb < size and grid[na][nb] == 0 and not empty_visited[na][nb]:
                            empty_visited[na][nb] = True
                            q.append((na, nb))
                if not reaches_border:
                    hole_count += 1
    return hole_count
```
Core function for 2D hole detection in blobs; uses BFS flood-fill per adjacent empty, checks border reach, and counts each non-border-connected empty component as one hole. Essential and correct.

The main `program` function orchestrates: deep-copies grid, gets mapping, finds 5-components via BFS, computes holes, applies mapping (default 0), recolors only the 5-cells. Helpful overall structure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided last (or only) submission; no prior attempts detailed, but the program correctly handles legend parsing for linear holes and 2D blob hole counting.
 * What worked: Successfully passed both training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of component detection, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the output recolors 5-blobs to 0 in many places (e.g., the repeating 6 and 4 patterns have internal 0's but are partially filled, suggesting possible over-erasure if hole counts didn't match legend), but legend colors (8,6,4) remain intact, and the top "8" shape looks properly colored while lower shapes appear as repeated patterns that might indicate mismatched hole counts (e.g., if blobs have varying holes but map to same or 0).
 * The vertical divider of 1's is correctly unchanged across the grid.
 * Hole counting seems accurate for enclosed areas, but may miss if empties are adjacent but not fully enclosed per component (unknown if this causes test mismatch).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_size, get_legend_mapping, compute_holes, program) are relevant and mostly correct, though compute_holes could be optimized to avoid revisiting the same empty from multiple blob cells (but it uses global visited, so it's fine).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 30x30 grid with left side all 0's, a vertical divider of 1's in column 24, and right side with three main sections: top (rows ~2-6) forming an "8"-like shape with internal 0's colored as 8's; middle (rows ~7-16) with repeating vertical "6"-like patterns (alternating 6 and 0) colored as 6's; bottom (rows ~17-28) with similar repeating "4"-like patterns colored as 4's.
 * It makes sense overall as the legend likely maps 0 holes to 8, 1 hole to 6, 2 holes to 4, and the shapes are blobs with those hole counts (top has no internal holes, middle has one gap per repeat, bottom two); empties remain 0, and no 5's left, indicating successful recoloring.
 * However, the repeating patterns in middle/bottom suggest multiple small blobs per "letter," and if any had unmapped holes, they became 0 (explaining solid fills with gaps); this looks correct and matches puzzle rules, but could be incorrect if the test expects merged components or different hole counting (e.g., if repeats are one big blob with more holes)—unknown without expected output, but no obvious errors like leftover 5's or wrong legend changes.

[2025-10-02 11:05:47] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are consistent across **every** example (both train inputs/outputs). These are limited to obvious, verifiable patterns in the data properties (color, holes, bbox, pixels). No assumptions are made about semantic meaning, shape silhouettes, or higher-level puzzle logic. Only properties that directly influence or correlate with each other in a repeatable way are listed. Irrelevant elements (e.g., black background, overall panel layout) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., varying color cycles or removal thresholds) are not forced; instead, the consistent core interaction is isolated. No position-based transformations (e.g., bbox shifts) or pixel count changes occur consistently, so they are not connected. If a property shows no clear interaction (e.g., why certain holes are mappable), it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Hole Count → Color (for Orange Shapes Only)**
   - **Description**: The hole count of an Orange shape determines its new color in the output. This is a direct mapping interaction: Orange shapes are recolored based on their hole count, but only if a matching hole count exists in the initial non-Orange shapes.
   - **Components Involved**: Orange shapes (input) interact with the hole counts of initial non-Orange shapes (which act as a "dictionary" or reference).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in both train examples.
     - In Train 1: Orange shapes with holes=0 → Yellow; holes=1 → Green; holes=2 → Blue; holes=3 → Red. (Matching initial non-Orange shapes: Yellow holes=0, Green holes=1, Blue holes=2, Red holes=3.)
     - In Train 2: Orange shapes with holes=0 → Red; holes=1 → Green. (Matching initial non-Orange shapes: Red holes=0, Green holes=1.)
   - **Effects**: Color changes; all other properties (holes, bbox, pixels) remain identical.
   - **Unknown/Limitations**: The exact mechanism for deriving the mapping (e.g., why initial shapes' colors are used as targets) is unknown but consistently applied. No interaction with other colors (e.g., non-Orange shapes do not change color).

#### 2. **Initial Non-Orange Shapes' Hole Count and Color → Mapping for Orange Recoloring**
   - **Description**: The hole count and color of initial small non-Orange shapes (typically the top-row-like elements with low, consecutive hole counts starting from 0) define a reference mapping that affects the color of all subsequent Orange shapes with matching hole counts.
   - **Components Involved**: Initial non-Orange shapes (small, low-hole polyominoes) interact with all Orange shapes by providing the target color for matching holes.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in both train examples.
     - In Train 1: Initial shapes provide mappings for holes=0 (Yellow), =1 (Green), =2 (Blue), =3 (Red), which are applied to Oranges.
     - In Train 2: Initial shapes provide mappings for holes=0 (Red), =1 (Green), which are applied to Oranges (including the large Orange with holes=0).
   - **Effects**: Enables color transformation in Orange shapes (as in connection #1); initial shapes themselves remain unchanged.
   - **Unknown/Limitations**: Why only small, consecutive low-hole non-Orange shapes (e.g., up to 3 in Train 1, up to 1 in Train 2) form the mapping is unknown. Larger or non-consecutive non-Orange shapes (e.g., bars) do not contribute to the mapping.

#### 3. **Hole Count Mismatch (for Orange Shapes) → Removal**
   - **Description**: Orange shapes with a hole count that has no matching reference in the initial non-Orange shapes are removed entirely from the output (no equivalent shape appears).
   - **Components Involved**: Orange shapes interact with the set of hole counts from initial non-Orange shapes; absence of a match triggers removal.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in both train examples.
     - In Train 1: Orange with holes=4 has no initial non-Orange match (max initial holes=3), so removed.
     - In Train 2: Orange with holes=2 has no initial non-Orange match (max initial holes=1), so removed.
   - **Effects**: Complete elimination of the shape (bbox, pixels, etc., not preserved).
   - **Unknown/Limitations**: The threshold for "mismatch" (e.g., no modulo or cycling observed; strictly exact match required) is unknown but consistently results in removal.

#### 4. **Non-Orange Shapes → No Change (Static Preservation)**
   - **Description**: All non-Orange shapes (including bars and initial small shapes) remain entirely unchanged, unaffected by any other components or properties.
   - **Components Involved**: Non-Orange shapes do not interact with Orange shapes, hole counts, or mappings; they are isolated.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in both train examples (e.g., initial small shapes and Blue bars retain exact color, holes, bbox, pixels).
   - **Effects**: Full preservation (color, holes, bbox, pixels identical).
   - **Unknown/Limitations**: None observed; this is a consistent non-interaction (i.e., no transformation triggered).

#### Non-Interconnected or Irrelevant Properties
- **Position (bbox)**: No consistent interaction; bbox remains identical for preserved/transformed shapes but does not influence color, holes, or removal.
- **Size (pixels)**: No consistent interaction; pixels remain identical but do not affect color, mapping, or removal (e.g., small vs. large Oranges transform similarly if holes match).
- **Other Colors (e.g., bars' Blue)**: No interaction with Orange transformations; bars are preserved as non-Orange.
- **Holes in Non-Orange Shapes**: Only used for mapping (connection #2); do not affect their own preservation.
- **Overall Count/Arrangement**: Output has fewer items than input consistently (due to removals), but no pattern in ordering or aggregation beyond individual transformations.

These connections are derived solely from property matches between inputs/outputs and are limited to what is obvious and identical across both train examples. No broader puzzle solution or test application is implied.

[2025-10-02 11:06:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty), where the goal is to transform sparse, patterned, or outlined placements of colors into solid, filled blocks or shapes of consistent colors, likely by interpreting scattered high-value cells as frames, checkers, or sparse indicators that need to be densified or replaced to form coherent solid regions. The transformation preserves some existing patterns (like the top solid-like rows in training example 1) but fills in 0s and adjusts high colors to create uniform blocks of lower colors (e.g., 1,2,3,4) in specific geometric arrangements, such as full rows, rectangles, or aligned clusters.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are large (30x30 based on output lists), mostly 0s, with sparse non-zero colors; focus on connected or patterned groups rather than isolated cells.
 * High colors (e.g., max_c like 4 in train 1, 6 in test) appear in sparse or alternating patterns (e.g., checkers in train 1 row 2), which should be resolved into solid blocks of a single lower color, not cycled replacements.
 * Palette extraction should identify unique non-zero, non-max colors (1,2,3 in train 1; 2,3 in train 2), but exclude 1 if no full row of 1s exists—however, this logic fails as it doesn't fill 0s or expand patterns.
 * Full rows of 1s (e.g., row 5 in both trains) are preserved or introduced as dividers/borders; subtle: 1s often form horizontal barriers or solid lines.
 * Patterns like alternating colors (e.g., 3,0,3 in train 1 row 2) become solid (3,3,3), suggesting "fill the gaps" rule for same-color sparse lines or checkers.
 * Blocks must align to form larger shapes: e.g., in train 1 expected, lower sections have rectangular 3s, 4s, 1s, 2s stacked or adjacent; in train 2, vertical/horizontal solids of 2s and 3s.
 * Subtle: Replacements aren't simple (i+j) cycling; instead, entire regions get uniform color (e.g., all 4s in a block), possibly based on majority color or position-based assignment to palette.
 * 0s in between same-color cells must be filled if part of a pattern; isolated high colors may stay or be removed, but connected/sparse groups expand.
 * No full-row-1 check seems universal—train 1 has it, train 2 doesn't emphasize it, but 1s appear in solids anyway.
 * Max color replacement only touches max_c cells, ignoring 0-fills; expected changes many 0s to colors, indicating region detection (e.g., bounding boxes or flood-fill).
 * Consider object extraction: Identify "blobs" (connected components of non-0, ignoring max_c as outlines) and fill their convex hull or minimal bounding rectangle with a palette color.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns stay 0; patterns don't overlap or bleed; test has 4,5,6 suggesting palette [1,4,5?] but needs solid fills like 6->uniform 4 or similar.
 * All non-0 colors < max are palette candidates, but assignment is per-region, not per-cell.

```
Note: `extract_blobs` is helpful for detecting regions to fill but needs refinement (e.g., treat max_c as outlines, fill interior 0s). `fill_region` assumes rectangular fill, which matches expected solids but may overfill non-rect shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies max color and basic palette (e.g., [1,2,3] for train 1, excluding 4; [2,3] for train 2, excluding higher), and preserves some top patterns (e.g., rows 1-3 in train 1 match expected).
 * Replacement logic (cycling palette via (i+j) % len(palette) only for max_c cells) works partially for sparse max_c but fails to fill 0s, leading to scattered results instead of solids (e.g., train 1 row 8 generated has isolated 1,2; expected has solid 4,4).
 * has_full_one_row correctly detects row 5 of 1s in train 1 and excludes 1 from palette if absent, but this doesn't help filling and is irrelevant for train 2 where 1s appear in solids without full rows.
 * compute_replacement is unhelpful/broken: (i+j) modulo creates alternating patterns (e.g., train 1 lower generated has mixed 1,2,3,4 instead of uniform blocks like expected's 3,3,3 or 1,1,1,1).
 * No region detection: Program ignores connected components, so it doesn't expand sparse patterns (e.g., train 2 row 2 generated keeps alternating 2,3; expected fills to solid 2s across).
 * Train 1 mismatches in lower half: Generated scatters palette colors into original 0s/max positions (e.g., row 9 has 4,3,1 but isolated; expected has solid 3,3,3), unknown reason but likely due to no fill logic—it's different by not densifying.
 * Train 2 mismatches broadly: Generated introduces wrong placements (e.g., row 1 has 3,2 in position 18-19; expected has 2,2), and fails to create large solids (e.g., row 14 expected has solid 2s and 3s; generated mixes).
 * get_palette excludes 1 correctly sometimes but doesn't use it for filling full rows/blocks.
 * Overall, program only touches max_c cells, but expected changes 0s too, indicating need for blob extraction and filling.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it retains many original 5s and 6s in scattered patterns (e.g., row 2 has mixed 5,6,4; row 3 has long 5s but interrupted), without forming solid blocks like expected in trains (e.g., no uniform 4,5,6 regions).
 * It appears to replace some 6s with palette cycles (possibly [1,4,5]? since 1s in column 24, 4/5/6 mixed elsewhere), but leaves most 5s intact and doesn't fill 0s (e.g., row 0 has isolated 5s and 1; should likely be solid horizontal 5s or similar based on train patterns).
 * Missing solid fills: e.g., row 7 generated has [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,...] with gaps; expected logic would fill to [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,...] or assign uniform color per cluster.
 * Introduces 1s in column 24 across rows, possibly from palette, but they form a vertical line without expansion, unlike train solids; this doesn't match coherent blocks and seems like erroneous per-cell replacement.
 * Lower rows (e.g., row 20) keep sparse 5s without densifying to rectangles, and end with mixed 4s—looks incorrect as it doesn't resolve patterns into uniforms, differing from train expectations where alternates become solids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells with values <=4 must be preserved unchanged, while connected components (using 4-connectivity) of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored using a cycling palette of unique colors present in the grid (specifically, colors c where 0 < c < max_color, sorted in descending order), with components discovered and colored in raster order (row-major traversal from top-left). The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, likely representing some form of region segmentation or object recoloring in a larger image puzzle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and flood fill should only traverse and recolor cells where the original grid value g[nx][ny] > 4, ensuring no leakage into <=4 cells.
 * Palette extraction: Compute max_color as the global maximum in the grid; then collect unique colors strictly between 1 and max_color-1 (exclusive of 0 and max_color itself), sort them descending (e.g., if colors 1,2,3,4 and max=5, palette=[4,3,2,1]); cycle through this palette for each new component using component_id % len(palette), defaulting to 1 if palette empty.
 * Discovery order: Components are found and colored in strict raster order—scan rows left-to-right, top-to-bottom; only start a new flood fill on unvisited cells >4 encountered during this scan.
 * Preservation: All cells <=4 (including 0) stay exactly as in input; only >4 cells are overwritten during flood fill.
 * Subtlety: The input grid likely contains high values (>4) that form "blobs" or regions to be unified under one color per component, but the printed outputs suggest the original high values are not shown—focus on matching the expected recoloring patterns.
 * Potential miss: If max_color is low (e.g., 4), palette might be empty or limited, forcing fallback to color 1; ensure seen set correctly filters 0 < c < max_c.
 * Edge case: Grids may have isolated >4 cells or large components spanning multiple areas; raster order means earlier-discovered components get higher palette colors (since descending sort).
 * Another subtlety: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid recoloring the same component multiple times, but since it's BFS from the starting cell, this is handled if implemented correctly—however, mismatches suggest over- or under-flooding in complex shapes.
 * General: Outputs are 30x30 grids (based on list lengths), with many 0s as background; differences often occur in mid-to-lower rows, suggesting issues with later-discovered components or irregular shapes.
 * From attempts: The BFS flood fill works for simple/early components (e.g., top of train1 matches), but fails on irregular or adjacent components, possibly due to incorrect palette cycling or discovery order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy
from collections import deque

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Find the maximum color value in the grid."""
    if not grid or not any(grid):
        return 0
    return max(max(row) for row in grid if row)

def get_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract unique colors between 1 and max_color - 1, sorted descending."""
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = {c for row in grid for c in row if 0 < c < max_c}
    return sorted(seen, reverse=True)
```
These functions are helpful and correct for palette extraction—they accurately compute the cycling colors based on existing low values. Use them in future attempts.

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    """Perform BFS flood fill on >4 connected cells (4-connectivity), coloring with given color."""
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
This flood fill is helpful and mostly correct (BFS with 4-connectivity, bounds checking, condition on g>4)—it succeeds for early/simple components but may fail on shape complexity; retain but verify against expected shapes.

The main program skeleton (deepcopy h=g, raster loop for discovery, cycling color assignment) is a good base but needs debugging for color assignment order.

No other functions from the attempt (e.g., no object extraction) are present or needed yet.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it partially understands the core mechanic of flood-filling >4 components with a cycled palette but fails both training examples.
 * What worked: Top sections of train1 (rows 0-4, 5-7? the solid lines of 4,3,1,2) match expected exactly, indicating correct preservation of <=4, correct early palette cycling (likely [4,3,2,1]), and functional flood fill for initial raster-discovered components.
 * What didn't work in train1: Mismatches start in lower rows (e.g., row 11: generated has a large 2-block where expected has 1's; row 12: generated 4's in positions expected as 1's; row 13: generated 1's shifted vs expected 4's and 1's; row 14: generated 1's where expected 4's; row 15: generated 1's/2's mismatched vs expected 1's/2's placements)—suggests wrong color assignment to later components, possibly due to incorrect component discovery order or palette cycling off-by-one (e.g., assigning 2 instead of 1, or treating separate components as one).
 * What didn't work in train2: More widespread mismatches (e.g., row 1: generated 3's where expected 2's; row 2: generated 3's in a block where expected 2's; rows 4-6: generated 3's/1's shifted vs expected 2's; lower rows like 9-11: generated 2's/3's where expected 3's/2's in different shapes; row 20: generated 1's where expected 3's)—indicates broader issues with component segmentation (e.g., merging adjacent regions incorrectly) or palette application (cycling to wrong colors like 3 instead of 2).
 * Overall: The attempt correctly implements raster order and BFS but likely errs in palette derivation (e.g., if max_c miscomputed, palette might include/exclude wrong colors) or visited tracking (causing partial fills); no evidence of handling empty palette or isolated cells perfectly.
 * Function `program` is the core but broken in color assignment for mid/late components—do not reuse without fixes; `flood_fill` is helpful but verify shapes manually.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but avoid assuming 8-connectivity or including <=4 in fills (easy miss).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the failed trainings (e.g., recoloring >4 cells with palette colors like 6,5,4,1, but likely wrong cycling/order since trainings failed).
 * Specific issues: Upper-left has 5's preserved (correct if <=4, but wait—5>4, so should be recolored; code preserves <=4 only, but output shows 5's in connected blocks, suggesting flood fill didn't trigger or palette includes 5 erroneously); mid-section (rows 8-16) has fragmented 5's/6's/1's that don't unify components cleanly (e.g., row 12 has scattered 6's where a large connected region might be expected to be one color); lower sections (rows 17-29) show 4's/1's/6's in irregular patterns that mismatch the unified blocks in trainings' expecteds (e.g., row 20 has a large 4-block, but adjacent 1's suggest improper segmentation).
 * It partially makes sense for simple areas (e.g., solid 1-row in row 5 preserved if <=4), but overall fails to unify >4 regions consistently—e.g., the 6's in rows 4-6/10-16 appear over-flooded or under-connected compared to expected uniform recoloring; without the test expected, it doesn't align with train patterns (e.g., no clear descending palette cycling visible).
 * To handle test: Ensure palette excludes any >4 originals (only 1 to max-1); debug discovery to catch vertical-spanning components early; the output's mix of high numbers (5,6) suggests the code isn't recoloring all >4 cells, possibly a bug in the condition (code checks g>4 correctly, but maybe input has values ==5 not flooding).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains "key" shapes (connected components of specific height, typically 3, with known colors and hole counts) that define a mapping from the number of holes in a shape to a target color, and this mapping is used to "decode" or recolor special shapes (likely color 5 components) by replacing them with the color corresponding to their hole count from the key. The goal is to output a transformed grid where decoded shapes are recolored appropriately, while leaving other parts unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-zero color; use DFS or stack-based flood fill to find them, tracking positions, bounding box (min/max row/col), height (max_r - min_r + 1), and size (number of cells).
 * Holes are defined as zero cells (empty space) that are fully enclosed; specifically, count individual 0 cells that have exactly 4 neighboring cells belonging to the component (up, down, left, right within bounds). This works for single-cell holes but fails for multi-cell holes (e.g., a 2x2 hole would have no 0 with 4 component neighbors, as inner 0's neighbor other 0's).
 * Key components for mapping are typically those with exact height 3 and not color 5; their hole count maps to their own color (e.g., a height-3 component with 1 hole and color 3 means mapping[1] = 3).
 * Only transform components that are color 5: compute their hole count h, and if h is in the mapping, recolor all cells in that component to mapping[h]; otherwise, set to 0 (erase). Do not transform other colors or non-height-3 keys.
 * Subtlety: The grid may have multiple components per color; ensure components are disjoint. Height is bounding box height, not actual shape height (e.g., a sparse vertical shape might have height 3 but not span all rows). Zeros outside components are background, not holes unless enclosed.
 * Easy to miss: Mapping is one-way (holes to color), and if no matching h, erase (set to 0), but in practice, all 5's should match a key. Grids have consistent width (30 columns here), and outputs must preserve structure (copy input, modify only targeted cells). Potential for diagonal connections? No, 4-way only. Multi-hole shapes or 0-holes (solid) must be handled; keys may include solid (h=0) or holed examples.
 * All considerations: Avoid counting non-enclosed 0's as holes (only those with n==4 component neighbors). Components may touch edges, so no wrapping. If a 0 is on edge, it can't have 4 neighbors anyway. Size may be used for validation (e.g., ignore tiny components), but not in this attempt. Transformed output must match expected exactly, including all 0's and unchanged areas.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements connected component detection with stack-based flood fill, bounding box calculation, and height computation, which works for identifying key shapes and targets.
 * Hole counting works for single-cell enclosed 0's (e.g., detects the hole in the top "3" shape in ex1), but fails for larger/multi-cell holes since no 0 would have exactly 4 component neighbors (unhelpful for complex shapes; do not rely on it without fixes like flood-fill for enclosed regions).
 * Mapping logic uses only height==3 and non-color-5 components, which seems correct for keys (e.g., top of ex1 has height-3 shapes of colors 1,2,3,4 with h=0 or 1), but transformation only applies to color 5, assuming input has 5's in encoded areas.
 * In training example 1, generated output keeps original colors (e.g., 4's in rows 9-11, columns 3-5 and 9-11; 4's in rows 12-16 various positions) where expected changes them to 3's (rows 9-12, cols 3-5), 1's (rows 12-13, cols 20-25; rows 14-16, cols 18-20), and 2's (rows 20-23, cols 13-17), indicating no transformation occurred—likely because those areas are not color 5 in input, or hole counts didn't match mapping (unknown why, but difference is clear: unchanged vs. recolored to match key hole equivalents).
 * In training example 1, other differences: row 17 has 3's in cols 3-5 where expected has 3's (this matched, but isolated); row 19 has 3's where expected has 3's (partial match); row 27 has 4's where expected has 4's (unchanged parts correct), but overall ~70% mismatch in lower grid.
 * In training example 2, generated keeps 2's and 3's in upper/mid (e.g., rows 1-6 unchanged correctly), but lower areas like rows 9-16 have 2's/3's where expected has 3's (rows 9-16, cols 20-27 changed to 3's with holes); row 20 has 2's where expected has 3's (cols 20-24); row 23 has 3's where expected has 3's (partial); differences suggest transformation skipped or mapping wrong (e.g., h=0 mapped incorrectly, unknown reason).
 * In training example 2, bottom rows 23-27 have 3's in generated where expected has 3's in some spots but 0's/2's elsewhere (e.g., row 23 cols 0-3: 0's expected vs. 3's generated—over-transformation?); ~60% mismatch.
 * apply_color_transformation function is helpful for targeted recoloring but sets to 0 if no mapping, which may be correct but leads to mismatches if all should map.
 * The program copies the input grid to out, which is good for preserving unchanged areas, but since transformations fail, outputs resemble input too closely.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding (components and holes) but broken application (no decoding in encoded areas).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be mostly unchanged from what is likely the input, with a vertical column of 1's (rows 0-29, col 24) unchanged, and patterned areas of 8's (rows 1-3, cols 26-28 with hole at row 2 col 27), 6's (rows 7-16, cols 26-28 with multiple single holes like row 8 col 27, row 10 col 27, etc.), and 4's (rows 17-27, cols 26-28 with holes like row 18 col 27) all preserved as-is, suggesting no recoloring happened.
 * If the puzzle requires decoding these patterned areas (assuming they are color 5 in input) based on hole counts matching a key (e.g., the 1's column might be a solid h=0 key implying color 1 for solids), the output should replace the 8/6/4 patterns with colors like 1 or others corresponding to their hole counts (e.g., 8's has 1 hole → map to color with 1 hole from key; 6's has ~4-5 single holes → multi-hole color), but instead they remain, making it invalid.
 * The repetitive height-3 patterns in 8/6/4 suggest they are encoded shapes awaiting transformation, but since only color 5 is targeted, if input uses other colors (e.g., 8,6,4 as "special" instead of 5), nothing changes—likely the core bug, as test mirrors training mismatches.
 * No erasures to 0 where unmapped, and top/bottom empty rows unchanged correctly, but lack of any decoding means it fails the puzzle's intent.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-8 likely represent colors, 0 is empty, 5 is orange/special) where connected components (blobs) of the same color form "header" keys in the top section that encode mappings based on their shape (specifically, number of enclosed holes/empty spaces), and orange (5) blobs elsewhere must be transformed to match the color from the header with the equivalent hole count; if no match, they become empty (0).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only: up, down, left, right), not diagonal, and must be same color to connect.
 * Header candidates are limited to top-ish rows (min row <=4), exclude orange (5), require size >=5 cells, and are sorted left-to-right by minimum column to assign indices (0,1,2,... for mapping).
 * Hole counting is critical but tricky: it measures fully enclosed empty (0) regions within a component's bounding box, ignoring external empties or those touching other colors; must pad the subgrid to avoid border leaks, treat other colors as barriers (not traversable), and only count original-grid empties as valid holes (not artifacts).
 * Orange components are transformed only if their hole count matches a header index; otherwise, erase to 0; non-orange components stay unchanged.
 * Grid has dividers/bars (full rows of 1's or empties) separating sections (e.g., header, body, examples); preserve these.
 * Subtleties: Bounding box for holes must be tight but padded; flood fill starts from subgrid borders (including padding) to mark exterior empties; unvisited interior 0's that are original empties count as holes; components may span multiple rows/columns irregularly, so min/max row/col must be accurate; multiple oranges may exist, each transformed independently; headers might have holes formed by their own shape or adjacent empties, but not touching edges/other colors in ways that leak.
 * Easy to miss: Offset in subgrid mapping (e.g., sr = gr - minr +1) can shift positions wrongly; flood fill must not cross barriers (other colors=2); hole count=0 might map to first header; candidates might overlap or be mis-sorted if min-col ties; small/irregular oranges might have 0 holes but still need mapping; entire grid is 30 cols wide, variable height; preserve all non-orange, non-transformed cells exactly.
 * Across attempts: No multiple attempts shown, but this single attempt highlights need for robust hole detection (current flood fill buggy, overcounts/underestimates enclosures); consider diagonal leaks? No, 4-connect only; headers may not be solid blocks—holes from internal gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core: Finds all 4-connected components of same color, returns list of (color, list of (r,c) positions)
def find_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # Implementation as in attempt: DFS/stack-based, marks visited, groups by color.
    # This works well—correctly identifies blobs without issues in examples.
    pass  # (full code from attempt is solid, reuse it)
```

```python
# Attempts hole counting via subgrid + flood fill from borders.
# Helpful concept (enclosures via BFS/DFS on empties), but broken in practice: wrong offsets cause position shifts; flood treats padding correctly but miscounts if subgrid too small/large; only counts original 0's, which is good subtlety.
# Partially useful—fix offsets and validation for future.
def compute_holes(grid: List[List[int]], positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # Implementation as in attempt, but buggy (see below).
    pass  # (full code from attempt; debug offsets like offset_r=1, sr mapping)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly identifies components via find_components (blobs extracted accurately in generated outputs, e.g., header bars and body shapes preserved).
 * What worked: Header candidate selection (top rows, size>=5, exclude 5) and left-to-right sorting by min-col; transformation logic for oranges (replace if mapped, else 0); preserves non-oranges/dividers (e.g., full 1-rows intact in both trainings).
 * What didn't work: Hole computation is fundamentally flawed—underestimates or misidentifies enclosures, leading to wrong mappings (e.g., Train 1: orange blob around rows 9-16 should map to 3 based on 1 hole? but generates 1's/4's wrongly; positions shifted, like row9 col3-5 as 3 expected but 1 generated). Train 1 mismatches: row9 col3-5=1 gen vs 3 exp; row10 col2-3,5-6=1 gen vs 3 exp; row11 col8-9=4 gen but exp has 1's elsewhere misplaced; row12 col12-13=4 gen vs exp 4 but surrounding 1's wrong; many oranges not transformed or wrong color (e.g., bottom 4's unchanged, but exp has 3's/1's/2's in body). Train 2 mismatches: row8 col26-27 missing 3's; row9 col10-12=2 gen vs exp 2 but row10 col11-12=2 gen vs exp 2, but body oranges like row19-22 col21-25=3's missing in gen; row23-26 has extra/missing 3's placements (e.g., row23 col4-7=3 exp but absent in gen). Unknown why holes miscomputed—possibly subgrid offsets (offset_r/c=1) cause gr/gc out-of-bounds or wrong mapping, leading to 0 holes for all? Result: mappings empty or wrong (e.g., idx=0 maps nothing, oranges stay 5 or become 0 prematurely).
 * get_header_mapping sorts correctly but relies on bad holes, so empty dict often; transform_orange_components erases oranges without mapping (e.g., Train1 bottom oranges gone to 0, but exp has 2's/1's).
 * compute_holes is broken/not fully helpful (overly complex subgrid with wrong validation—counts non-original empties sometimes; suggest simplify to direct flood on full grid with barriers).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond that; find_components is essential and correct for extracting objects.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it partially transforms some oranges (e.g., col26-28 has 8/6/4 patterns suggesting hole-based mapping to 8,6,4), but many oranges remain 5 or unchanged (e.g., row1-6 col24-25=1's preserved but surrounding 5? implied not transformed; row17-30 col24=1's but body blobs like row18-26 col1-5/25-29 seem partially 4/6 but irregular, missing full enclosures). It looks like incomplete mapping: headers (top 1's, mid 6's/8's?) detected but holes wrong, so some oranges (e.g., sparse 1's in col24) stay, others half-transform (e.g., row8-16 col25=1 but exp likely full color fill); no erasures to 0 visible, suggesting mappings partial but not erasing unmatched. Why not correct: Similar to trainings, hole miscomputation likely assigns wrong indices (e.g., if all headers get 0 holes, only first maps, rest fail); test has more sparse/irregular blobs (e.g., dotted 8's/6's/4's), so bounding box leaks empties not enclosed; output has preserved 5? No, gen shows no 5's, all transformed or 1/0, but patterns don't match expected solid fills (e.g., row2 col26-29=8,8,8,0 vs likely solid 8 block). Account for test's dotted headers (holes from gaps) and vertical oranges needing precise enclosure check.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where cells with values ≤4 (including 0s and pre-colored 1-4) remain unchanged, while connected components of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored with cycling colors 1-4 based on the order in which the components are first discovered during a raster-order scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The goal is to produce a output grid that matches expected colorings for these components, likely representing some form of blob detection and labeling in a larger puzzle context, such as distinguishing shapes or regions in a nonogram-like or segmentation task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed only from cells >4, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), treating ≤4 cells as barriers that cannot be crossed.
 * Discovery order for assigning colors is strictly raster: scan row 0 left-to-right, then row 1, etc.; the first unvisited >4 cell encountered starts a new component, which gets the next color in cycle (1 for first, 2 for second, 3 for third, 4 for fourth, then back to 1).
 * All cells in a component must be uniformly colored with the assigned color, replacing their original >4 value; no partial coloring or retention of original values.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous in appearance due to ≤4 barriers, but the flood-fill must not leak across them; easy to miss if stack-based fill visits invalid neighbors.
 * Another subtlety: Large horizontal or vertical strips (e.g., entire rows of >4) form single components if connected, but scattered >4 cells separated by ≤4 are separate components discovered independently.
 * Input grids seem to contain pre-existing 1-4 colors in some areas (unchanged), suggesting the puzzle overlays new component coloring only on >4 regions without overwriting existing 1-4.
 * Potential miss: If input has isolated >4 cells or thin shapes, they each get their own color based on discovery position; over-merging components (e.g., via 8-connectivity) would incorrectly combine them.
 * Flood-fill must mark visited to avoid re-coloring; non-recursive stack is fine but must handle bounds correctly.
 * Overall puzzle likely tests understanding of image segmentation: >4 as "foreground" blobs to label sequentially.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating original."""

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity only
    stack = [(x, y)]
    visited[x][y] = True
    h[x][y] = color
    while stack:
        cx, cy = stack.pop()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_valid(nx, ny, size) and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt uses correct structure for raster-order discovery and 4-connected flood-fill on >4 cells, leaving ≤4 unchanged, which works for basic component detection (e.g., upper regions in training 1 match expected for colors 4,3,1,2 in rows 1-3).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and colors some early-discovered components, like the vertical 4s in row1-3 col1-3, horizontal 3s in row1-3 col5-7, striped 1s in row1-3 col9-13, and long 2s in row1-3 col15-21; also handles full-row 1s in row5 perfectly.
 * What didn't work: Color assignments mismatch for later components due to apparent errors in discovery order or component merging; e.g., in training 1, a small 2x1 component in row8 col10-11 is colored 2 in generated but should be 4 in expected (suggesting it was discovered as the 4th component, not 2nd); similarly, lower-left 3s (rows9-11 col3-6) are correct but adjacent 2s in row10-11 col8-11 become 2s instead of expected 4s, indicating over-merging or skipped components.
 * In training 1, generated incorrectly colors a blob in rows12-16 col20-25 as mixed 4s and 1s, while expected has consistent 1s there, showing flood-fill didn't fully capture the component (possibly due to barriers or visit bugs).
 * In training 2, early components (2s/3s/1s in rows1-6) mostly match, but mid-grid mismatches like row9 col10-12 colored 4 instead of expected 2, and large 3-blob in rows9-25 col20-27 partially correct but with wrong cycling (e.g., row20 col20-24 as 3s but expected has splits into separate 3-components); lower 4s in rows23-27 also mismatched.
 * extract_objects not present in attempt, but could be helpful for debugging: a function to list component sizes/positions before coloring to verify discovery order.
 * The copy_grid and is_valid are helpful and correct; flood_fill is mostly helpful but subtly broken in handling large/irregular shapes (e.g., doesn't fully propagate in L-shapes or around 0-barriers in training 1 lower sections).
 * assign_colors_to_components is the core logic and helpful, but buggy in component ID cycling—perhaps off-by-one in (component_id % 4) + 1, or raster scan misses isolated cells.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, but flood_fill could be improved with queue (BFS) for consistent order vs stack (DFS), though DFS should work if visited is proper.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same logic, coloring >4 regions with 1-4 (e.g., large 3-blob in rows2-7 col1-7, 2s in rows4-6 col20-22, 1s scattered in col24, 4s in col26-28), leaving 0s and presumed pre-4s unchanged, which seems consistent with the attempt's approach.
 * It does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., the sprawling 3 in upper-left might be over-merged (rows2-7 col1-8 includes separated parts via row7 col4-6, but if 0s barrier, should split); similarly, mid-grid 2s in rows9-16 col16-23 appear as one big component but likely should cycle colors for sub-parts like the vertical in row15-16 col16-19 vs horizontal in row12 col13-16.
 * Lower 4s in rows17-30 col26-28 are consistent stripes, but interspersed 1s in col24 suggest correct isolation; however, without expected test output, hard to confirm, but mismatches like irregular 1-blob in rows20-29 col10-24 (jumping around) indicate flood-fill didn't connect properly (e.g., row22 col9-12 as 1s but separated by 0s from row24 col8-11).
 * Overall, test output follows the flawed pattern from training (partial matches in early/simple components, errors in complex/later ones), so likely incorrect in color order/merging; to fix, need to verify input grid's >4 positions mentally—e.g., if test has diagonal >4 connections, 4-connectivity fails.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of height values where cells greater than 4 ("high" cells) form connected components that must be colored using a cycling palette of [4, 3, 1, 2], while low cells (≤4) remain 0 in the output; the goal is to produce an output grid `h` that matches expected colorings for these components. The current program uses flood fill to identify and color 4-connected components in row-major order, but it fails to match expected outputs due to incorrect color assignments for specific components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * High cells (>4) are connected only via 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count, which is correctly implemented but may not explain all mismatches.
 * Components are discovered in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), assigning colors sequentially from the palette; this order leads to wrong colors in expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle may require a different discovery order (e.g., by component size, position, or sorted by starting coordinates) or non-cycling assignment rules.
 * Low cells (≤4) are preserved from the input grid in `h` but appear as 0 in all printed outputs, implying input low cells are already 0 or the printing normalizes them; however, the program correctly avoids overwriting them.
 * Palette cycles every 4 components: ID 0→4, 1→3, 2→1, 3→2, 4→4, etc.; mismatches occur when a component gets a color offset from expected (e.g., a component colored 2 in generated but 4 in expected), indicating ~2 fewer prior components in discovery or a shifted palette start.
 * Subtle element: Some components in expected outputs appear "split" or "merged" differently, but shapes match exactly across generated/expected—differences are purely in color values, not filled positions, so the issue is assignment logic, not connectivity or `is_high`.
 * All components, regardless of size, must be colored if they contain high cells; no omission based on size or holes (no evidence of hole-counting rules).
 * Grid size is square (e.g., 30x30 in examples), and output must exactly replicate expected structure, including isolated high cells as single-cell components.
 * Potential miss: Colors might be assigned based on the minimum row/column of the component's starting cell (e.g., sorted by topmost/leftmost position), or perhaps by component area/size descending, which would reorder discovery and fix color offsets.
 * Visually, outputs resemble "islands" or "blobs" of terrain heights, suggesting a map-coloring puzzle where adjacent blobs get different colors, but the cycling is fixed, not adjacency-based (no conflict resolution needed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def is_high(c: int) -> bool:
    return c > 4
```
(This correctly identifies cells to color; keep it.)

```python
def get_color(component_id: int) -> int:
    palette = [4, 3, 1, 2]
    return palette[component_id % len(palette)]
```
(This implements cycling but may need adjustment, e.g., different palette order [4,1,3,2] or non-modulo logic; currently helpful for basic assignment.)

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and is_high(g[nx][ny]) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
(This performs correct 4-connected BFS flood fill on high cells only; essential and bug-free—keep and reuse.)

(The main `program` function is helpful as a skeleton: it deep-copies `g` to `h`, initializes visited, and iterates to find unvisited high cells, but the row-major iteration order causes color mismatches.)

(No extraction functions like for objects/holes were used or needed; the problem doesn't involve counting holes or extracting separate elements beyond components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and fills all high-cell components with consistent shapes matching expected (no shape errors), but assigns wrong colors due to discovery order—e.g., in Training 1, row 12 columns 12-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 14 columns 9-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 15 columns 9-12 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), suggesting a color offset of 2 for later components.
 * In Training 1, row 16 column 5 is 4 (generated) but 3 (expected); row 17-20 have 4 where expected has 3, indicating early components get shifted colors (e.g., second component colored 4 instead of 3).
 * In Training 2, row 1 columns 18-19 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected); row 2-7 have large 4-block where expected has 2, showing a major color shift for a prominent component; row 14 columns 12-14 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected).
 * In Training 2, row 9 columns 10-12 are 1 (generated) but 2 (expected), a small isolated mismatch possibly from single-cell handling.
 * Overall, component discovery in row-major order works for finding all blobs but fails on color sequencing; no evidence of 8-connectivity needed, as shapes match.
 * Flood fill is efficient and correct (uses BFS via deque, marks visited to avoid overlaps); the issue is upstream in iteration order or palette application.
 * No unhelpful functions present—all provided (is_high, get_color, flood_fill) are relevant, though get_color's palette order may need tweaking (e.g., try [1,2,3,4] or sort starts by min_i then min_j explicitly).
 * Attempt demonstrates understanding of connected components but misses the key subtlety of color assignment rules, leading to consistent but offset colorings across both trainings.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed row-major discovery and cycling logic that failed both trainings, likely producing similar color offsets (e.g., early components may get 4 where expected has 3, or vice versa based on component count).
 * Specific issues: In the test output, a large 3-blob in rows 1-6 columns 1-7 appears overcolored as one component, but if expected splits or reorders it, colors like the 4 in row 4 column 20-22 may be wrong; similarly, the 2-blob in rows 2-4 columns 14-18 looks connected but may need different color if discovery order shifts.
 * The 1-column in rows 0-29 column 24 is consistently 1, which might be correct for an isolated vertical component, but if the palette cycles wrong, it could be expected as 4 or 2.
 * Scattered 4-blobs (e.g., rows 11-16 columns 20-29) dominate late, suggesting they get higher IDs and cycle back incorrectly; the output has mixed 2/4 in row 20-29, which visually resembles terrain islands but mismatches if expected uses position-based coloring.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense as colored high regions but fails the core rule of matching expected color patterns, as seen in trainings—e.g., the 3 in row 7 column 9-11 may be an offset from expected 1 or 2; without input g, hard to verify shapes, but assuming shapes are correct (per trainings), colors are likely wrong.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns where connected "objects" or blobs (likely defined by cell values above a threshold, such as >4) need to be identified and recolored using a cycling palette of lower colors (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc., derived from colors present in the grid excluding 0 and the maximum value), while strictly preserving all background and low-value patterns (≤4) without overwriting them. The goal appears to be simplifying or solid-filling these high-value blobs to create cleaner, colored shapes without expanding into surrounding areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components (4-directional adjacency) only for cells with values >4; low values (0-4) must remain untouched, including sparse or patterned arrangements like checkerboards, stripes, or isolated cells.
 * Palette is derived from unique colors in the grid that are >0 and < max color; assign colors cyclically to components (e.g., first component gets color 1, second gets 2, cycling back if more components than colors).
 * Do not fill bounding boxes—only recolor the exact cells in each connected component to avoid overwriting preserved low-value areas; this is a critical subtlety, as overfilling creates solid blocks where expected outputs show maintained sparsity or shapes.
 * Grids are square (e.g., 30x30 based on outputs), with 0 as background; high components may be irregular shapes, not rectangles, and filling must match their footprint exactly.
 * Subtle elements: Some "objects" in expected outputs appear to preserve internal low-value holes or patterns (e.g., 0's inside high areas stay 0), but high cells are uniformly recolored; components might touch but not merge if separated by low values; palette order seems sorted ascending (e.g., [1,2,3,...]).
 * Across attempts, note that max color varies (e.g., up to 4 in train1? but >4 threshold assumes higher); test has 1-6, so threshold >4 may work but confirm if it's > max low or fixed.
 * Preserve exact positions: Expected outputs show high areas replaced but low patterns (e.g., dotted lines of 1's or 2's) intact, unlike generated solid fills.
 * Easy to miss: Components are strictly >4 connected; isolated high cells are single-cell components; cycling palette means repeated colors for many components; no modification if no palette or no high components.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    return max((max(row) for row in grid), default=0)
```
(This correctly computes the max color for palette exclusion.)

```python
def get_appearance_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = set()
    palette = []
    for row in grid:
        for c in row:
            if 0 < c < max_c and c not in seen:
                seen.add(c)
                palette.append(c)
    return palette
```
(This extracts a useful palette of intermediate colors, sorted by appearance; helpful for cycling assignments, though may need sorting if order matters.)

```python
def get_high_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    size = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * size for _ in range(size)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if grid[i][j] > 4 and not visited[i][j]:
                positions = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    positions.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and grid[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(positions)
    return components
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of >4 cells; uses DFS via stack, captures exact positions without expansion; key for identifying blobs to recolor.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies high components (>4 connected) and derives a palette, but fails by using bounding box filling, which expands recoloring into surrounding low-value areas (e.g., turns sparse patterns into solid blocks).
 * For train1: Generated large solid fills (e.g., full row 5 as all 1's; oversized 4/3/2 blocks in lower half overwriting 0's and patterns), differing from expected where upper patterns match but lower shows sparse recolored blobs (e.g., irregular 4's in rows 8-10, dotted 3's/1's/2's in rows 11-29, no full rows); unknown why palette cycling started with 4/3/1/2 instead of 1/2/3/4, but overfill is main issue.
 * For train2: Generated solid blocks (e.g., extended 1's into rows 1-7; oversized 2's/3's in lower half), differing from expected sparse recoloring (e.g., dotted 2's in rows 1-4, irregular 3's/1's in rows 20-29, no full solid rows); again, bounding box overfill destroys patterns.
 * fill_bounding_box is broken and unhelpful—creates rectangles that ignore component shape and overwrite lows; replace with exact-position filling (e.g., for pos in positions: new_grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] = color).
 * program overall partially works (copies grid, applies per component) but skips exact filling and may cycle palette incorrectly if not sorted.
 * No other attempts provided, but this shows partial understanding: component detection good, but filling/preservation bad.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows large solid blocks (e.g., rows 0-6 mostly 1's with some 5/4/6 intrusions; oversized 5's in rows 9-17; full rows of 6/4 in lower half), which likely overfills bounding boxes and overwrites sparse low patterns (e.g., isolated 1's and 6's in row 0, dotted 6's in row 1), unlike expected training outputs that preserve sparsity (e.g., dotted lines, irregular shapes). This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it homogenizes the grid too much—expected should have recolored high (>4, like 5/6) blobs exactly (e.g., small clusters of uniform color without expansion) while keeping 1/4 patterns intact; unknown exact input but overfill evident from blocky vs. patterned training expects.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a legend in the top rows (likely rows 1-3, 0-indexed) of a 30x30 grid maps the number of internal holes (enclosed empty regions) in colored bar segments to specific colors, and the task is to identify connected components of black cells (value 5) in the grid, compute the number of enclosed holes adjacent to each component (empty regions of 0's that do not connect to the grid border), and replace the component with the corresponding color from the legend mapping; if no mapping exists for the hole count, replace with 0 (empty).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend is extracted only from non-black (non-5) colored segments in rows 1-3 that have width >=3, where the color is taken from the first non-zero cell in row 2 of the segment, and the number of holes is the count of 0's strictly between the first and last non-zero cells in row 2 (gaps in the bar represent holes).
 * Black cells (5's) may appear in the legend rows themselves and are part of the puzzle to color, not part of the legend; legend extraction must skip segments where the extracted color is 5 to avoid contaminating the mapping with invalid entries like mapping[some_holes]=5.
 * Connected components of 5's are found via flood-fill (BFS/DFS) across 4 directions (up, down, left, right), treating only 5's as part of the component; other colors (1,2,3, etc.) and 0's block connectivity.
 * Holes are computed per component by identifying all adjacent 0 cells, then performing BFS on each unvisited connected empty region starting from those adjacents; a region is a hole only if its BFS does not reach any border cell (rows/cols 0 or 29), and each such disconnected empty region counts as exactly one hole regardless of size.
 * Empty regions (0's) are global in the sense that visited empties are marked per component's hole computation to avoid double-counting, but only regions adjacent to the specific component are considered (enclosed holes must touch the component).
 * If the hole count is not in the legend mapping, the entire component is set to 0; otherwise, set to the mapped color; existing non-5 cells in the grid (like pre-colored legend bars) are left unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Legend segments are separated by columns where all three rows (1-3) are 0; overlapping or adjacent segments must be handled by advancing col correctly after each.
 * Subtlety: Components may span the legend rows and main puzzle area, forming large connected 5-regions; hole detection must handle complex shapes where some "holes" may connect to the border via external 0's, making them non-holes.
 * Subtlety: The grid is 30x30, borders are rows/cols 0 and 29; empty regions touching these are not holes (open to outside).
 * General: Assume 0 is empty/white background; colors are positive integers (1,2,3,...); 5 is always black to replace; no diagonal connectivity.
 * From attempts: Hole BFS correctly uses deque for efficiency; visited arrays prevent reprocessing; deepcopy ensures input grid isn't modified externally.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core logic for legend extraction, component finding, and hole counting works when no 5's intrude into legend rows.
 * Training example 2 failed: the large connected 5-component spanning rows 1-7 (cols ~14-24) remained as 5's instead of being replaced with 2's; small 5's in row 1 cols 18-19 stayed 5's instead of 2's; row 7 cols 16-20 stayed 5's instead of 2's; this happened because legend extraction included the 5-segment in rows 1-3, setting mapping[0]=5 (or similar), causing the whole component to "color" to 5 and stay unchanged.
 * Other parts of training 2 worked: top-left 2-bar and 3-bar (with gap) were left as-is (pre-colored); bottom 3-blobs were correctly left or not processed (no 5's there); the 1's column was unchanged.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_legend_mapping, compute_holes, program) are core and helpful but buggy in legend skipping 5's; component extraction via BFS is essential and correct.
 * Subtle bug: Global col advancement in legend skips empty columns correctly but doesn't isolate legend from puzzle 5's in rows 1-3.
 * Unknown: Exact mapping for training 2 (likely 0 holes -> 2, 1 hole -> 3 based on bars), but hole count for big blob is probably 0 (no enclosed empties, just open shape), which should map to 2.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: multiple 5-components remain unchanged (e.g., top cluster rows 0-1 cols 9-11 stays 5's; mid-left rows 7-15 cols 9-11? stays 5's; bottom rows 17-28 cols 24? has 5's scattered but should be replaced), indicating same bug as training 2—legend extraction likely included 5-segments, mapping some holes to 5 and leaving components as 5's.
 * Incorrect colorings: Some areas colored to 8 (e.g., row 2 cols 15-18, row 3 col 13-15/19/26-28), 6 (rows 7-16 cols 26-28 with gaps), 4 (rows 17-28 cols 26-28 with gaps), but these may be overzealous mappings from contaminated legend; 1's column (col 24) stays 1's (correct, pre-colored).
 * Expected for test (mentally simulated): Legend likely maps 0->1? (solid bar), 1->8 (one gap), 2->6 (two gaps), 3->4 (three gaps) based on input patterns in rows 1-3; top 5-cluster (rows 0-1 cols 9-11) probably 0 holes -> color 1 but output has 5's (wrong); mid 5's (rows 7-15 cols 9-11?) likely enclosed holes -> 6 or 8 but output 5's (wrong); bottom 5's (rows 17-28 col 24? scattered vertical) probably 0 or 1 hole -> 1 or 8 but output mixes 5's and 4's incorrectly; all 5's should be replaced, no 5's in output.
 * Test highlights subtlety: Multiple separate 5-components with varying hole counts (e.g., some with gaps simulating 1-3 holes); contaminated mapping causes fallback to 5 instead of 0 or correct color.
 * Overall, test output shows incomplete replacement of 5's and possibly wrong colors (e.g., 4's in bottom may be partial, but 5's persistence confirms bug).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains a legend in the top rows (specifically rows 1-3) that maps the number of internal holes (gaps in a sequence) to specific colors, and the main task is to identify connected components (blobs) of the color 5 in the rest of the grid, count their enclosed empty (0) spaces that do not connect to the grid border, and recolor each blob with the corresponding color from the legend based on the hole count (or to 0 if no mapping exists).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend is extracted only from rows 1, 2, and 3; it ignores columns where all three rows are 0 and processes horizontal stretches of at least 3 consecutive columns with non-zero values in those rows.
 * In the legend, the number of holes is counted as the zeros in row 2 between the first and last non-zero cell in that stretch (ignoring single-cell or no-hole cases, and skipping color 5 entirely).
 * Blobs are 4-way connected components of exactly color 5; other colors (like dividers as 1's or pre-colored legend elements) are left unchanged.
 * Hole counting for blobs identifies fully enclosed empty (0) regions adjacent to the blob that do not reach any grid border, using flood-fill from adjacent 0's and checking if the flood reaches the edge; each such disconnected empty component counts as one hole (not the size of the empty area).
 * The grid size can vary but must be at least 4 for legend processing; copy the grid to avoid modifying the input.
 * Subtlety: Holes in legend are linear gaps in row 2, while blob holes are 2D enclosed areas; ensure flood-fill marks visited empties to avoid double-counting.
 * Subtlety: Blobs with 0 holes or unmapped hole counts become 0 (erased); legend skips invalid stretches (width <3, no gaps, or color 5).
 * Consider border-reaching empties as not holes (they are "open" spaces); multiple disconnected enclosed empties per blob each count separately.
 * Dividers (e.g., vertical column of 1's) and pre-existing non-5 colors (e.g., legend colors like 4,6,8) remain unchanged.
 * Grid is square (N x N), with left side often empty (all 0's) and right side containing the blobs separated by a divider.

Core function for 2D hole detection in blobs; uses BFS flood-fill per adjacent empty, checks border reach, and counts each non-border-connected empty component as one hole. Essential and correct.

The main `program` function orchestrates: deep-copies grid, gets mapping, finds 5-components via BFS, computes holes, applies mapping (default 0), recolors only the 5-cells. Helpful overall structure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided last (or only) submission; no prior attempts detailed, but the program correctly handles legend parsing for linear holes and 2D blob hole counting.
 * What worked: Successfully passed both training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of component detection, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the output recolors 5-blobs to 0 in many places (e.g., the repeating 6 and 4 patterns have internal 0's but are partially filled, suggesting possible over-erasure if hole counts didn't match legend), but legend colors (8,6,4) remain intact, and the top "8" shape looks properly colored while lower shapes appear as repeated patterns that might indicate mismatched hole counts (e.g., if blobs have varying holes but map to same or 0).
 * The vertical divider of 1's is correctly unchanged across the grid.
 * Hole counting seems accurate for enclosed areas, but may miss if empties are adjacent but not fully enclosed per component (unknown if this causes test mismatch).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_size, get_legend_mapping, compute_holes, program) are relevant and mostly correct, though compute_holes could be optimized to avoid revisiting the same empty from multiple blob cells (but it uses global visited, so it's fine).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 30x30 grid with left side all 0's, a vertical divider of 1's in column 24, and right side with three main sections: top (rows ~2-6) forming an "8"-like shape with internal 0's colored as 8's; middle (rows ~7-16) with repeating vertical "6"-like patterns (alternating 6 and 0) colored as 6's; bottom (rows ~17-28) with similar repeating "4"-like patterns colored as 4's.
 * It makes sense overall as the legend likely maps 0 holes to 8, 1 hole to 6, 2 holes to 4, and the shapes are blobs with those hole counts (top has no internal holes, middle has one gap per repeat, bottom two); empties remain 0, and no 5's left, indicating successful recoloring.
 * However, the repeating patterns in middle/bottom suggest multiple small blobs per "letter," and if any had unmapped holes, they became 0 (explaining solid fills with gaps); this looks correct and matches puzzle rules, but could be incorrect if the test expects merged components or different hole counting (e.g., if repeats are one big blob with more holes)—unknown without expected output, but no obvious errors like leftover 5's or wrong legend changes.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are consistent across **every** example (both train inputs/outputs). These are limited to obvious, verifiable patterns in the data properties (color, holes, bbox, pixels). No assumptions are made about semantic meaning, shape silhouettes, or higher-level puzzle logic. Only properties that directly influence or correlate with each other in a repeatable way are listed. Irrelevant elements (e.g., black background, overall panel layout) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., varying color cycles or removal thresholds) are not forced; instead, the consistent core interaction is isolated. No position-based transformations (e.g., bbox shifts) or pixel count changes occur consistently, so they are not connected. If a property shows no clear interaction (e.g., why certain holes are mappable), it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Hole Count → Color (for Orange Shapes Only)**
   - **Description**: The hole count of an Orange shape determines its new color in the output. This is a direct mapping interaction: Orange shapes are recolored based on their hole count, but only if a matching hole count exists in the initial non-Orange shapes.
   - **Components Involved**: Orange shapes (input) interact with the hole counts of initial non-Orange shapes (which act as a "dictionary" or reference).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in both train examples.
     - In Train 1: Orange shapes with holes=0 → Yellow; holes=1 → Green; holes=2 → Blue; holes=3 → Red. (Matching initial non-Orange shapes: Yellow holes=0, Green holes=1, Blue holes=2, Red holes=3.)
     - In Train 2: Orange shapes with holes=0 → Red; holes=1 → Green. (Matching initial non-Orange shapes: Red holes=0, Green holes=1.)
   - **Effects**: Color changes; all other properties (holes, bbox, pixels) remain identical.
   - **Unknown/Limitations**: The exact mechanism for deriving the mapping (e.g., why initial shapes' colors are used as targets) is unknown but consistently applied. No interaction with other colors (e.g., non-Orange shapes do not change color).

#### 2. **Initial Non-Orange Shapes' Hole Count and Color → Mapping for Orange Recoloring**
   - **Description**: The hole count and color of initial small non-Orange shapes (typically the top-row-like elements with low, consecutive hole counts starting from 0) define a reference mapping that affects the color of all subsequent Orange shapes with matching hole counts.
   - **Components Involved**: Initial non-Orange shapes (small, low-hole polyominoes) interact with all Orange shapes by providing the target color for matching holes.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in both train examples.
     - In Train 1: Initial shapes provide mappings for holes=0 (Yellow), =1 (Green), =2 (Blue), =3 (Red), which are applied to Oranges.
     - In Train 2: Initial shapes provide mappings for holes=0 (Red), =1 (Green), which are applied to Oranges (including the large Orange with holes=0).
   - **Effects**: Enables color transformation in Orange shapes (as in connection #1); initial shapes themselves remain unchanged.
   - **Unknown/Limitations**: Why only small, consecutive low-hole non-Orange shapes (e.g., up to 3 in Train 1, up to 1 in Train 2) form the mapping is unknown. Larger or non-consecutive non-Orange shapes (e.g., bars) do not contribute to the mapping.

#### 3. **Hole Count Mismatch (for Orange Shapes) → Removal**
   - **Description**: Orange shapes with a hole count that has no matching reference in the initial non-Orange shapes are removed entirely from the output (no equivalent shape appears).
   - **Components Involved**: Orange shapes interact with the set of hole counts from initial non-Orange shapes; absence of a match triggers removal.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in both train examples.
     - In Train 1: Orange with holes=4 has no initial non-Orange match (max initial holes=3), so removed.
     - In Train 2: Orange with holes=2 has no initial non-Orange match (max initial holes=1), so removed.
   - **Effects**: Complete elimination of the shape (bbox, pixels, etc., not preserved).
   - **Unknown/Limitations**: The threshold for "mismatch" (e.g., no modulo or cycling observed; strictly exact match required) is unknown but consistently results in removal.

#### 4. **Non-Orange Shapes → No Change (Static Preservation)**
   - **Description**: All non-Orange shapes (including bars and initial small shapes) remain entirely unchanged, unaffected by any other components or properties.
   - **Components Involved**: Non-Orange shapes do not interact with Orange shapes, hole counts, or mappings; they are isolated.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in both train examples (e.g., initial small shapes and Blue bars retain exact color, holes, bbox, pixels).
   - **Effects**: Full preservation (color, holes, bbox, pixels identical).
   - **Unknown/Limitations**: None observed; this is a consistent non-interaction (i.e., no transformation triggered).

#### Non-Interconnected or Irrelevant Properties
- **Position (bbox)**: No consistent interaction; bbox remains identical for preserved/transformed shapes but does not influence color, holes, or removal.
- **Size (pixels)**: No consistent interaction; pixels remain identical but do not affect color, mapping, or removal (e.g., small vs. large Oranges transform similarly if holes match).
- **Other Colors (e.g., bars' Blue)**: No interaction with Orange transformations; bars are preserved as non-Orange.
- **Holes in Non-Orange Shapes**: Only used for mapping (connection #2); do not affect their own preservation.
- **Overall Count/Arrangement**: Output has fewer items than input consistently (due to removals), but no pattern in ordering or aggregation beyond individual transformations.

These connections are derived solely from property matches between inputs/outputs and are limited to what is obvious and identical across both train examples. No broader puzzle solution or test application is implied.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:09:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows (specifically rows 1-3) contain a legend that maps the number of holes (enclosed empty spaces) in shapes to specific colors, and the rest of the grid contains unidentified shapes made of the value 5 that must be replaced with the appropriate color from the legend based on their hole count; if no mapping exists, they default to 0 (empty).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend is extracted only from rows 1, 2, and 3 (0-based indexing), focusing on non-empty vertical spans in these rows that are at least 3 columns wide; it identifies the color in row 2 at the start of a filled segment and counts the number of 0-gaps (holes) between the first and last non-zero in row 2 to create a mapping from hole count to color—skipping spans if the color is 5, if the span is too narrow, or if there's no valid first/last in row 2.
 * Shapes are connected components of 5's (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right), found via BFS or DFS traversal starting from unvisited 5 cells.
 * Hole counting for a shape involves flooding from empty (0) cells adjacent to the shape's cells; each flood-fill of connected 0's that does not reach the grid border counts as one enclosed hole—requires a separate visited grid for empties to avoid recounting, and checks border reachability (rows/columns 0 or size-1).
 * Subtlety: Holes are only counted if fully enclosed by the shape (no border connection), but empty spaces connected to the border are not holes (they're outside); multiple holes per shape are possible if there are separate enclosed regions.
 * Default to 0 if a shape's hole count has no legend mapping; the grid is copied deeply to avoid modifying the input.
 * Edge cases: Empty components (0 holes), shapes touching the border (may affect hole enclosure), legend spans with all zeros in row 2 (skipped), or legend colors of 5 (skipped as invalid); grid size must be at least 4 for legend processing.
 * No diagonal connectivity for shapes or empties; only orthogonal.
 * Legend parsing skips leading/trailing empty columns and processes contiguous non-empty vertical blocks independently.

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def get_size(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return len(grid)
```
Basic grid size utility.

```python
def get_legend_mapping(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    size = get_size(grid)
    if size < 4:
        return {}
    r1, r2, r3 = grid[1], grid[2], grid[3]
    mapping: Dict[int, int] = {}
    col = 0
    while col < size:
        while col < size and r1[col] == 0 and r2[col] == 0 and r3[col] == 0:
            col += 1
        if col >= size:
            break
        start_col = col
        while col < size and not (r1[col] == 0 and r2[col] == 0 and r3[col] == 0):
            col += 1
        end_col = col - 1
        width = end_col - start_col + 1
        if width < 3:
            col = end_col + 1
            continue
        first = -1
        last = -1
        for c in range(start_col, end_col + 1):
            if r2[c] != 0:
                if first == -1:
                    first = c
                last = c
        if first == -1 or first == last:
            col = end_col + 1
            continue
        color = r2[first]
        if color == 5:
            col = end_col + 1
            continue
        num_holes = sum(1 for c in range(first + 1, last) if r2[c] == 0)
        mapping[num_holes] = color
        col = end_col + 1
    return mapping
```
Helpful for parsing the legend: identifies valid spans in rows 1-3, counts gaps in row 2 as holes, maps to starting color in row 2; skips invalid cases like width <3 or color=5.

```python

                    if a == 0 or a == size - 1 or b == 0 or b == size - 1:
                        reaches_border = True
                    for ddx, ddy in directions:
                        na = a + ddx
                        nb = b + ddy
                        if 0 <= na < size and 0 <= nb < size and grid[na][nb] == 0 and not empty_visited[na][nb]:
                            empty_visited[na][nb] = True
                            q.append((na, nb))
                if not reaches_border:
                    hole_count += 1
    return hole_count
```
Core hole-counting function: floods from adjacent empties, counts only non-border-reaching floods as holes; uses BFS and separate visited for empties.

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = get_size(g)
    grid = copy.deepcopy(g)
    mapping = get_legend_mapping(grid)

    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    for r in range(size):
        for c in range(size):
            if grid[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                component = []
                q = deque([(r, c)])
                visited[r][c] = True
                component.append((r, c))

                        if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and grid[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            component.append((nx, ny))
                h = compute_holes(grid, component)
                color = mapping.get(h, 0)
                for x, y in component:

```
Main program: combines legend mapping, component finding (BFS for 5's), hole counting, and replacement with mapped color (or 0).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations to compare directly; however, the code demonstrates solid understanding of component extraction and hole flooding.
 * Legend mapping correctly handles skipping empty columns and narrow spans, but may miss if legend uses row 1 or 3 for hole indication (code only counts gaps in row 2).
 * Hole computation correctly identifies enclosed regions but starts floods only from cells adjacent to the component, which could miss isolated internal holes not touching the shape (though in standard topology, holes must be adjacent; potential subtlety if shapes have internal empties not adjacent).
 * Component finding via BFS is efficient and marks visited to handle disconnected shapes separately.
 * Deep copy ensures input grid isn't modified.
 * Training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating core logic works for simpler cases (likely smaller grids or standard hole counts).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and build toward the solution.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a vertical divider of 1's in column 24 across all rows, and three distinct patterned regions in columns 26-28: rows 1-6 have an irregular 8-filled shape (suggesting 0 holes mapped to 8), rows 7-16 have repeating 6-filled shapes with single gaps (suggesting 1 hole mapped to 6), and rows 17-28 have similar repeating 4-filled shapes with single gaps (suggesting 1 or 2 holes mapped to 4); rows 0 and 29 are mostly empty with 1's in col 24.
 * This looks partially correct based on inferred rules: different colors (8,6,4) for different hole counts aligns with legend mapping, and the divider of 1's is preserved (not 5's, so untouched); however, without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify if the 5-components were accurately replaced— the repeating patterns in lower sections suggest the program correctly identified multiple similar components, but the irregular top 8-shape (rows 1-6) has varying densities (e.g., row 2 has more 8's than row 5), which might indicate correct hole counting for a complex shape, or possibly over/under-counting if the input had touching components.
 * Potential issue: All lower patterns use the same color within their sections (6's and 4's), but if the test input had varying hole counts per shape, this uniform coloring might be wrong (e.g., if some shapes have 0 holes but got mapped to 1-hole color); the output defaults many cells to 0, which is correct for non-5 areas, but the legend extraction might have failed if the test legend was wider or used different row structures, leading to missing mappings (e.g., why 8,6,4 specifically?).
 * Overall, the test output makes sense structurally (colored regions separated, no 5's left, holes likely influencing colors), but subtle differences like uniform coloring in repeating sections could indicate the hole counter isn't distinguishing intra-section variations, or the legend mapping is too simplistic for the test's complexity—it's different from a "perfect" output if the test expects more granular per-shape coloring.

[2025-10-02 11:09:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.


[2025-10-02 11:17:37] Response:
```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return copy_grid(g)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 11:18:42] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors, shapes, or connected components/objects) where the task is to transform the input grid into an output grid by applying specific rules, such as relabeling, filling, or extracting patterns based on connected regions of the same number. The goal appears to be generating a "solved" or patterned version of the grid, possibly like a nonogram, blob identification, or rule-based recoloring, where unchanged copying fails because the expected outputs show systematic changes in number values and placements while preserving some structural elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids are 30x30 (30 rows, each with 30 integers), with 0 likely representing empty/background space and positive integers (1-5 in training, up to 8 in test) denoting distinct objects, colors, or connected components that need to be identified, relabeled, or propagated according to rules.
 * Connected components seem important: numbers form "blobs" or shapes (e.g., solid blocks, dotted patterns like every other cell), and the transformation may involve renumbering them (e.g., assigning sequential labels like 1,2,3,4 based on position, size, or type) or filling sparse patterns into solid ones.
 * In training example 1, the upper section (rows 1-8) remains mostly unchanged (e.g., solid blocks of 4,3,1,2 and dotted patterns), but the lower section (rows 9+) is transformed: generated keeps original 5-blobs, but expected relabels them to 4,3,1,2 with altered shapes (e.g., expected row 9 has 4's where generated has 5's; expected introduces new 1's and 2's in rows 20-25 that generated lacks, and row 26 is all 0's in generated but has missing elements in expected).
 * Subtlety: Dotted patterns (e.g., every other cell filled, like in row 3: 4,4,4 then 3,0,3,0 etc.) are preserved in structure but may need relabeling if they represent specific object types; solid blocks (e.g., row 6 all 1's) stay intact.
 * In training example 2, upper section (rows 1-8) partially matches but diverges early: generated has large 5-blobs in rows 3-6 where expected has 2's; lower section shows mismatched blob sizes and labels (e.g., generated row 10 has 5's scattered, expected has 2's and 3's in different positions; generated row 23 has 5's where expected has 3's in a sparser pattern).
 * Key consideration: Transformations seem to propagate labels downward or by region (e.g., upper grid uses 1-4, lower uses relabeled versions); ignore or omit certain blobs (e.g., 5's treated as temporary and replaced). Handle varying blob densities—solid vs. sparse—and ensure output doesn't introduce new numbers unless rule-based (test has 1,4,5,6,8, suggesting more labels needed).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs must exactly match expected patterns, including 0 placements; partial matches (e.g., upper rows correct) aren't enough. Rules may involve scanning row-by-row or column-wise for connections (4-connected or 8-connected?). No global copy works, as inputs aren't the targets.
 * Across attempts: No prior attempts shown beyond this copy program, but it highlights that blind copying fails on all non-trivial parts; future attempts need object detection to identify and relabel blobs independently per section (e.g., upper vs. lower grid halves).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were used in this attempt, as it only included a basic copy_grid for duplication (which is trivial and not puzzle-specific).

```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is unhelpful for the puzzle—it's just a shallow copy utility and doesn't analyze or transform; avoid relying on it alone, as it preserves inputs unchanged.)

No other functions (e.g., for extracting objects or connected components) were provided or used; future attempts should include something like flood-fill for blob detection or pattern matching for dotted/solid identification.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one shown) used a no-op program that simply copies the input grid, resulting in outputs identical to inputs for both training examples, which were marked INCORRECT because the expected outputs show deliberate transformations (e.g., relabeling 5-blobs to 1-4 in training 1 lower section, reshaping 5's to 2's and 3's in training 2).
 * What worked: The copy preserved exact structure where input already matched expected (e.g., rows 1-8 in training 1 are identical, including dotted patterns for 3's and solid 1's; some upper rows in training 2 match partially, like the 1's in row 1 and 7).
 * What didn't work: Failed to apply any transformation, so lower sections diverged entirely—e.g., in training 1, generated kept 5-blobs (rows 9-30 with scattered/dotted 5's) while expected replaced them with restructured 4,3,1,2 blobs (e.g., expected row 12 has 1's at end where generated has 5's; expected row 27 has 4's where generated has 5's). In training 2, generated introduced extraneous 5-blobs (e.g., row 3 has solid 5's vs. expected dotted 2's) and mismatched shapes (e.g., row 15 has 5's in positions where expected has 3's). No object extraction, so it couldn't detect or relabel components.
 * The copy_grid function is broken for the puzzle purpose—it's accurate for duplication but irrelevant, as the problem requires analysis (e.g., connected component labeling); don't use it as the core of future programs.
 * Overall, demonstrated zero understanding of transformation rules, leading to identical input-output with no pattern recognition.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (generated by the copy program) does not look correct—it appears to be the raw input grid unchanged, featuring mixed numbers (1's in a vertical strip on the right, 5-blobs in upper-left, 8's in a small block, 6's mid-right, 4's lower-right) with irregular, scattered patterns (e.g., dotted 5's in rows 2-6, solid-ish 5's in rows 9-16, sparse 4's in rows 18-29).
 * It doesn't make sense as a solution because training examples show that raw inputs (with temporary labels like 5's) need relabeling and reshaping to sequential lower numbers (1-4) with cleaner patterns (e.g., solid blocks or consistent dots); here, high numbers like 8 and 6 persist unchanged, and structures like the vertical 1's are preserved but likely need propagation or adjustment (e.g., expected might extend 1's or replace 5/8/6 with 2/3/4). No evident rule application, such as filling dots or sectioning the grid, so it fails similarly to training (e.g., keeps "5-blobs" that should be transformed). To handle test, future programs must account for higher labels (up to 8) and more complex interconnections (e.g., the 5's seem to form larger, irregular shapes crossing rows/columns).

[2025-10-02 11:18:42] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.


[2025-10-02 11:32:13] Response:
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[0 if cell == 5 else cell for cell in row] for row in g]
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 11:32:49] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where an input grid of numbers (likely representing colors, fills, or object types in a 30x30 grid) must be processed to produce an output grid that renders specific patterns, such as solid blocks, alternating fills (e.g., checkerboard-like), and isolated shapes of numbers like 1,2,3,4, while zeroing out backgrounds or irrelevant areas. The goal is to match exact expected patterns across multiple training examples, which include layered or overlapping shapes in different regions of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The output must preserve and correctly position non-zero patterns exactly as in the expected grids, including solid horizontal/vertical blocks (e.g., full row of 1s), alternating sparse fills (e.g., every other cell filled in rows like [4,4,4,0,3,0,3,0,...]), and more complex scattered or blob-like structures in lower grid sections (e.g., irregular shapes of 3s and 4s in train1 rows 9-15).
 * Zero out empty space (background) but do not zero out valid pattern cells; the input likely contains numbers 0-5 or higher (e.g., 8 in test), and the transformation isn't a simple replacement—patterns suggest rules like filling contours, propagating values, or extracting/rendering "objects" based on connectivity or adjacency.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns often appear in "bands" or sections (e.g., top 5-6 rows in train1/2 have consistent shapes across examples, but lower rows introduce new independent patterns); alternating rows sometimes have dense vs. sparse fills (e.g., row2 dense, row3 sparse); numbers like 1,2,3,4 may represent distinct object types that shouldn't mix or overwrite unless specified; test input introduces higher numbers (6,8) suggesting scalability beyond 1-4, but rules must handle without assuming fixed ranges.
 * Grids are 30 rows x 30 columns; outputs must match exactly, including trailing zeros; consider symmetry or repetition in patterns (e.g., repeating 8-0-8 in test generated, but expected likely more filled); potential for overlapping objects where higher numbers take precedence or are masked.
 * All attempts so far fail to handle lower grid sections, zeroing them incorrectly; no evidence of connectivity analysis (e.g., flood fill for blobs) or pattern detection (e.g., lines, shapes); inputs may have "noise" like 5s to remove, but that's insufficient alone.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were introduced in this attempt; the provided program is a simple list comprehension for replacement, which is too basic and doesn't extract or process patterns (e.g., no blob detection, no adjacency checks). Consider future tools like:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]], min_size: int = 1, value: int = None) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (row_start, col_start, value) for connected components
    # Use flood fill or DFS to identify connected regions of non-zero cells (optionally filtered by value)
    visited = [[False] * len(g[0]) for _ in g]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j] and (value is None or g[i][j] == value):
                size = flood_fill(g, i, j, visited, g[i][j])
                if size >= min_size:
                    blobs.append((i, j, g[i][j]))
    return blobs

def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, visited: List[List[bool]], target: int) -> int:
    if i < 0 or i >= len(g) or j < 0 or j >= len(g[0]) or visited[i][j] or g[i][j] != target:
        return 0
    visited[i][j] = True
    size = 1
    size += flood_fill(g, i-1, j, visited, target)
    size += flood_fill(g, i+1, j, visited, target)
    size += flood_fill(g, i, j-1, visited, target)
    size += flood_fill(g, i, j+1, visited, target)
    return size
```
This could help identify and render "objects" like the scattered 3s/4s in lower sections, which the current attempt ignores.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (replacing 5s with 0s) partially works for the top sections of both training examples (e.g., rows 1-5 and the full 1s row in train1 match expected solid/dense patterns of 4,3,1,2; similar for train2 top rows with 2,3,1), suggesting inputs may have 5s as noise in backgrounds that get correctly zeroed there.
 * Fails completely for lower grid sections: in train1, generates all zeros from row7 onward, but expected has complex patterns (e.g., row9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] with 4s; row10: 3s and 4s in a shape; extending to row29 with 4s), so entire lower half is incorrectly zeroed, missing blob-like structures of 1,2,3,4.
 * In train2, top rows partially match (e.g., row2: [0,2,2,2,0,3,3,3,0,1,0,...] matches expected), but from row6 onward mostly zeros or incomplete, while expected has extended 2s into row7, plus new patterns like 3s in rows 9-29 (e.g., row24: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,...] with sparse 3s); misses vertical/horizontal extensions and new shapes.
 * The simple replacement logic doesn't demonstrate understanding of pattern rules (e.g., why sparse alternations in odd rows? why isolated blobs below?); it's likely over-zeroing non-5 values or ignoring propagation/fill rules.
 * No functions for object extraction, so no way to detect or preserve lower patterns; this approach is broken for anything beyond noise removal and not helpful for the core puzzle (avoid simple value replacements in future).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places a vertical strip of 1s in column 25 across all rows (e.g., every row has 1 at position 25, with some 0s around), and then renders repeating horizontal patterns of [8,8,8] dense and [8,0,8] sparse in columns 27-29 for rows 2-6/8-16/18-28, similarly for 6s and 4s in lower bands—but this seems like a naive replication of top training patterns without adaptation, ignoring the test input's likely unique structure (e.g., higher numbers 6/8 suggest new object types, but output treats them as direct copies without filling or shaping).
 * It mismatches expected logic because training expects more integrated/complex shapes (e.g., train1 has irregular 3/4 blobs, not just vertical 1s); the output looks overly repetitive and sparse in wrong places (e.g., no full blocks or overlaps), zeroing most of the grid except right edge, which doesn't align with training's distributed patterns—likely missing rules for propagating values horizontally/vertically or detecting shapes per section.
 * To handle test, must account for higher values (6,8) as valid patterns (not zero them), and apply same fill rules (dense/sparse alternation, blob rendering) without assuming low numbers only.

[2025-10-02 11:32:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors, shapes, or connected components/objects) where the task is to transform the input grid into an output grid by applying specific rules, such as relabeling, filling, or extracting patterns based on connected regions of the same number. The goal appears to be generating a "solved" or patterned version of the grid, possibly like a nonogram, blob identification, or rule-based recoloring, where unchanged copying fails because the expected outputs show systematic changes in number values and placements while preserving some structural elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grids are 30x30 (30 rows, each with 30 integers), with 0 likely representing empty/background space and positive integers (1-5 in training, up to 8 in test) denoting distinct objects, colors, or connected components that need to be identified, relabeled, or propagated according to rules.
 * Connected components seem important: numbers form "blobs" or shapes (e.g., solid blocks, dotted patterns like every other cell), and the transformation may involve renumbering them (e.g., assigning sequential labels like 1,2,3,4 based on position, size, or type) or filling sparse patterns into solid ones.
 * In training example 1, the upper section (rows 1-8) remains mostly unchanged (e.g., solid blocks of 4,3,1,2 and dotted patterns), but the lower section (rows 9+) is transformed: generated keeps original 5-blobs, but expected relabels them to 4,3,1,2 with altered shapes (e.g., expected row 9 has 4's where generated has 5's; expected introduces new 1's and 2's in rows 20-25 that generated lacks, and row 26 is all 0's in generated but has missing elements in expected).
 * Subtlety: Dotted patterns (e.g., every other cell filled, like in row 3: 4,4,4 then 3,0,3,0 etc.) are preserved in structure but may need relabeling if they represent specific object types; solid blocks (e.g., row 6 all 1's) stay intact.
 * In training example 2, upper section (rows 1-8) partially matches but diverges early: generated has large 5-blobs in rows 3-6 where expected has 2's; lower section shows mismatched blob sizes and labels (e.g., generated row 10 has 5's scattered, expected has 2's and 3's in different positions; generated row 23 has 5's where expected has 3's in a sparser pattern).
 * Key consideration: Transformations seem to propagate labels downward or by region (e.g., upper grid uses 1-4, lower uses relabeled versions); ignore or omit certain blobs (e.g., 5's treated as temporary and replaced). Handle varying blob densities—solid vs. sparse—and ensure output doesn't introduce new numbers unless rule-based (test has 1,4,5,6,8, suggesting more labels needed).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs must exactly match expected patterns, including 0 placements; partial matches (e.g., upper rows correct) aren't enough. Rules may involve scanning row-by-row or column-wise for connections (4-connected or 8-connected?). No global copy works, as inputs aren't the targets.
 * Across attempts: No prior attempts shown beyond this copy program, but it highlights that blind copying fails on all non-trivial parts; future attempts need object detection to identify and relabel blobs independently per section (e.g., upper vs. lower grid halves).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were used in this attempt, as it only included a basic copy_grid for duplication (which is trivial and not puzzle-specific).

```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is unhelpful for the puzzle—it's just a shallow copy utility and doesn't analyze or transform; avoid relying on it alone, as it preserves inputs unchanged.)

No other functions (e.g., for extracting objects or connected components) were provided or used; future attempts should include something like flood-fill for blob detection or pattern matching for dotted/solid identification.

 * This attempt (the only one shown) used a no-op program that simply copies the input grid, resulting in outputs identical to inputs for both training examples, which were marked INCORRECT because the expected outputs show deliberate transformations (e.g., relabeling 5-blobs to 1-4 in training 1 lower section, reshaping 5's to 2's and 3's in training 2).
 * What worked: The copy preserved exact structure where input already matched expected (e.g., rows 1-8 in training 1 are identical, including dotted patterns for 3's and solid 1's; some upper rows in training 2 match partially, like the 1's in row 1 and 7).
 * What didn't work: Failed to apply any transformation, so lower sections diverged entirely—e.g., in training 1, generated kept 5-blobs (rows 9-30 with scattered/dotted 5's) while expected replaced them with restructured 4,3,1,2 blobs (e.g., expected row 12 has 1's at end where generated has 5's; expected row 27 has 4's where generated has 5's). In training 2, generated introduced extraneous 5-blobs (e.g., row 3 has solid 5's vs. expected dotted 2's) and mismatched shapes (e.g., row 15 has 5's in positions where expected has 3's). No object extraction, so it couldn't detect or relabel components.
 * The copy_grid function is broken for the puzzle purpose—it's accurate for duplication but irrelevant, as the problem requires analysis (e.g., connected component labeling); don't use it as the core of future programs.
 * Overall, demonstrated zero understanding of transformation rules, leading to identical input-output with no pattern recognition.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (generated by the copy program) does not look correct—it appears to be the raw input grid unchanged, featuring mixed numbers (1's in a vertical strip on the right, 5-blobs in upper-left, 8's in a small block, 6's mid-right, 4's lower-right) with irregular, scattered patterns (e.g., dotted 5's in rows 2-6, solid-ish 5's in rows 9-16, sparse 4's in rows 18-29).
 * It doesn't make sense as a solution because training examples show that raw inputs (with temporary labels like 5's) need relabeling and reshaping to sequential lower numbers (1-4) with cleaner patterns (e.g., solid blocks or consistent dots); here, high numbers like 8 and 6 persist unchanged, and structures like the vertical 1's are preserved but likely need propagation or adjustment (e.g., expected might extend 1's or replace 5/8/6 with 2/3/4). No evident rule application, such as filling dots or sectioning the grid, so it fails similarly to training (e.g., keeps "5-blobs" that should be transformed). To handle test, future programs must account for higher labels (up to 8) and more complex interconnections (e.g., the 5's seem to form larger, irregular shapes crossing rows/columns).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where an input grid of numbers (likely representing colors, fills, or object types in a 30x30 grid) must be processed to produce an output grid that renders specific patterns, such as solid blocks, alternating fills (e.g., checkerboard-like), and isolated shapes of numbers like 1,2,3,4, while zeroing out backgrounds or irrelevant areas. The goal is to match exact expected patterns across multiple training examples, which include layered or overlapping shapes in different regions of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The output must preserve and correctly position non-zero patterns exactly as in the expected grids, including solid horizontal/vertical blocks (e.g., full row of 1s), alternating sparse fills (e.g., every other cell filled in rows like [4,4,4,0,3,0,3,0,...]), and more complex scattered or blob-like structures in lower grid sections (e.g., irregular shapes of 3s and 4s in train1 rows 9-15).
 * Zero out empty space (background) but do not zero out valid pattern cells; the input likely contains numbers 0-5 or higher (e.g., 8 in test), and the transformation isn't a simple replacement—patterns suggest rules like filling contours, propagating values, or extracting/rendering "objects" based on connectivity or adjacency.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns often appear in "bands" or sections (e.g., top 5-6 rows in train1/2 have consistent shapes across examples, but lower rows introduce new independent patterns); alternating rows sometimes have dense vs. sparse fills (e.g., row2 dense, row3 sparse); numbers like 1,2,3,4 may represent distinct object types that shouldn't mix or overwrite unless specified; test input introduces higher numbers (6,8) suggesting scalability beyond 1-4, but rules must handle without assuming fixed ranges.
 * Grids are 30 rows x 30 columns; outputs must match exactly, including trailing zeros; consider symmetry or repetition in patterns (e.g., repeating 8-0-8 in test generated, but expected likely more filled); potential for overlapping objects where higher numbers take precedence or are masked.
 * All attempts so far fail to handle lower grid sections, zeroing them incorrectly; no evidence of connectivity analysis (e.g., flood fill for blobs) or pattern detection (e.g., lines, shapes); inputs may have "noise" like 5s to remove, but that's insufficient alone.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were introduced in this attempt; the provided program is a simple list comprehension for replacement, which is too basic and doesn't extract or process patterns (e.g., no blob detection, no adjacency checks). Consider future tools like:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]], min_size: int = 1, value: int = None) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (row_start, col_start, value) for connected components
    # Use flood fill or DFS to identify connected regions of non-zero cells (optionally filtered by value)
    visited = [[False] * len(g[0]) for _ in g]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j] and (value is None or g[i][j] == value):
                size = flood_fill(g, i, j, visited, g[i][j])
                if size >= min_size:
                    blobs.append((i, j, g[i][j]))
    return blobs

def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, visited: List[List[bool]], target: int) -> int:
    if i < 0 or i >= len(g) or j < 0 or j >= len(g[0]) or visited[i][j] or g[i][j] != target:
        return 0
    visited[i][j] = True
    size = 1
    size += flood_fill(g, i-1, j, visited, target)
    size += flood_fill(g, i+1, j, visited, target)
    size += flood_fill(g, i, j-1, visited, target)
    size += flood_fill(g, i, j+1, visited, target)
    return size
```
This could help identify and render "objects" like the scattered 3s/4s in lower sections, which the current attempt ignores.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (replacing 5s with 0s) partially works for the top sections of both training examples (e.g., rows 1-5 and the full 1s row in train1 match expected solid/dense patterns of 4,3,1,2; similar for train2 top rows with 2,3,1), suggesting inputs may have 5s as noise in backgrounds that get correctly zeroed there.
 * Fails completely for lower grid sections: in train1, generates all zeros from row7 onward, but expected has complex patterns (e.g., row9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] with 4s; row10: 3s and 4s in a shape; extending to row29 with 4s), so entire lower half is incorrectly zeroed, missing blob-like structures of 1,2,3,4.
 * In train2, top rows partially match (e.g., row2: [0,2,2,2,0,3,3,3,0,1,0,...] matches expected), but from row6 onward mostly zeros or incomplete, while expected has extended 2s into row7, plus new patterns like 3s in rows 9-29 (e.g., row24: [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,0,...] with sparse 3s); misses vertical/horizontal extensions and new shapes.
 * The simple replacement logic doesn't demonstrate understanding of pattern rules (e.g., why sparse alternations in odd rows? why isolated blobs below?); it's likely over-zeroing non-5 values or ignoring propagation/fill rules.
 * No functions for object extraction, so no way to detect or preserve lower patterns; this approach is broken for anything beyond noise removal and not helpful for the core puzzle (avoid simple value replacements in future).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places a vertical strip of 1s in column 25 across all rows (e.g., every row has 1 at position 25, with some 0s around), and then renders repeating horizontal patterns of [8,8,8] dense and [8,0,8] sparse in columns 27-29 for rows 2-6/8-16/18-28, similarly for 6s and 4s in lower bands—but this seems like a naive replication of top training patterns without adaptation, ignoring the test input's likely unique structure (e.g., higher numbers 6/8 suggest new object types, but output treats them as direct copies without filling or shaping).
 * It mismatches expected logic because training expects more integrated/complex shapes (e.g., train1 has irregular 3/4 blobs, not just vertical 1s); the output looks overly repetitive and sparse in wrong places (e.g., no full blocks or overlaps), zeroing most of the grid except right edge, which doesn't align with training's distributed patterns—likely missing rules for propagating values horizontally/vertically or detecting shapes per section.
 * To handle test, must account for higher values (6,8) as valid patterns (not zero them), and apply same fill rules (dense/sparse alternation, blob rendering) without assuming low numbers only.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty), where the goal is to transform sparse, patterned, or outlined placements of colors into solid, filled blocks or shapes of consistent colors, likely by interpreting scattered high-value cells as frames, checkers, or sparse indicators that need to be densified or replaced to form coherent solid regions. The transformation preserves some existing patterns (like the top solid-like rows in training example 1) but fills in 0s and adjusts high colors to create uniform blocks of lower colors (e.g., 1,2,3,4) in specific geometric arrangements, such as full rows, rectangles, or aligned clusters.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are large (30x30 based on output lists), mostly 0s, with sparse non-zero colors; focus on connected or patterned groups rather than isolated cells.
 * High colors (e.g., max_c like 4 in train 1, 6 in test) appear in sparse or alternating patterns (e.g., checkers in train 1 row 2), which should be resolved into solid blocks of a single lower color, not cycled replacements.
 * Palette extraction should identify unique non-zero, non-max colors (1,2,3 in train 1; 2,3 in train 2), but exclude 1 if no full row of 1s exists—however, this logic fails as it doesn't fill 0s or expand patterns.
 * Full rows of 1s (e.g., row 5 in both trains) are preserved or introduced as dividers/borders; subtle: 1s often form horizontal barriers or solid lines.
 * Patterns like alternating colors (e.g., 3,0,3 in train 1 row 2) become solid (3,3,3), suggesting "fill the gaps" rule for same-color sparse lines or checkers.
 * Blocks must align to form larger shapes: e.g., in train 1 expected, lower sections have rectangular 3s, 4s, 1s, 2s stacked or adjacent; in train 2, vertical/horizontal solids of 2s and 3s.
 * Subtle: Replacements aren't simple (i+j) cycling; instead, entire regions get uniform color (e.g., all 4s in a block), possibly based on majority color or position-based assignment to palette.
 * 0s in between same-color cells must be filled if part of a pattern; isolated high colors may stay or be removed, but connected/sparse groups expand.
 * No full-row-1 check seems universal—train 1 has it, train 2 doesn't emphasize it, but 1s appear in solids anyway.
 * Max color replacement only touches max_c cells, ignoring 0-fills; expected changes many 0s to colors, indicating region detection (e.g., bounding boxes or flood-fill).
 * Consider object extraction: Identify "blobs" (connected components of non-0, ignoring max_c as outlines) and fill their convex hull or minimal bounding rectangle with a palette color.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns stay 0; patterns don't overlap or bleed; test has 4,5,6 suggesting palette [1,4,5?] but needs solid fills like 6->uniform 4 or similar.
 * All non-0 colors < max are palette candidates, but assignment is per-region, not per-cell.

    return new_grid
```
Note: `extract_blobs` is helpful for detecting regions to fill but needs refinement (e.g., treat max_c as outlines, fill interior 0s). `fill_region` assumes rectangular fill, which matches expected solids but may overfill non-rect shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies max color and basic palette (e.g., [1,2,3] for train 1, excluding 4; [2,3] for train 2, excluding higher), and preserves some top patterns (e.g., rows 1-3 in train 1 match expected).
 * Replacement logic (cycling palette via (i+j) % len(palette) only for max_c cells) works partially for sparse max_c but fails to fill 0s, leading to scattered results instead of solids (e.g., train 1 row 8 generated has isolated 1,2; expected has solid 4,4).
 * has_full_one_row correctly detects row 5 of 1s in train 1 and excludes 1 from palette if absent, but this doesn't help filling and is irrelevant for train 2 where 1s appear in solids without full rows.
 * compute_replacement is unhelpful/broken: (i+j) modulo creates alternating patterns (e.g., train 1 lower generated has mixed 1,2,3,4 instead of uniform blocks like expected's 3,3,3 or 1,1,1,1).
 * No region detection: Program ignores connected components, so it doesn't expand sparse patterns (e.g., train 2 row 2 generated keeps alternating 2,3; expected fills to solid 2s across).
 * Train 1 mismatches in lower half: Generated scatters palette colors into original 0s/max positions (e.g., row 9 has 4,3,1 but isolated; expected has solid 3,3,3), unknown reason but likely due to no fill logic—it's different by not densifying.
 * Train 2 mismatches broadly: Generated introduces wrong placements (e.g., row 1 has 3,2 in position 18-19; expected has 2,2), and fails to create large solids (e.g., row 14 expected has solid 2s and 3s; generated mixes).
 * get_palette excludes 1 correctly sometimes but doesn't use it for filling full rows/blocks.
 * Overall, program only touches max_c cells, but expected changes 0s too, indicating need for blob extraction and filling.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it retains many original 5s and 6s in scattered patterns (e.g., row 2 has mixed 5,6,4; row 3 has long 5s but interrupted), without forming solid blocks like expected in trains (e.g., no uniform 4,5,6 regions).
 * It appears to replace some 6s with palette cycles (possibly [1,4,5]? since 1s in column 24, 4/5/6 mixed elsewhere), but leaves most 5s intact and doesn't fill 0s (e.g., row 0 has isolated 5s and 1; should likely be solid horizontal 5s or similar based on train patterns).
 * Missing solid fills: e.g., row 7 generated has [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,...] with gaps; expected logic would fill to [0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,...] or assign uniform color per cluster.
 * Introduces 1s in column 24 across rows, possibly from palette, but they form a vertical line without expansion, unlike train solids; this doesn't match coherent blocks and seems like erroneous per-cell replacement.
 * Lower rows (e.g., row 20) keep sparse 5s without densifying to rectangles, and end with mixed 4s—looks incorrect as it doesn't resolve patterns into uniforms, differing from train expectations where alternates become solids.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells with values <=4 must be preserved unchanged, while connected components (using 4-connectivity) of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored using a cycling palette of unique colors present in the grid (specifically, colors c where 0 < c < max_color, sorted in descending order), with components discovered and colored in raster order (row-major traversal from top-left). The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, likely representing some form of region segmentation or object recoloring in a larger image puzzle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and flood fill should only traverse and recolor cells where the original grid value g[nx][ny] > 4, ensuring no leakage into <=4 cells.
 * Palette extraction: Compute max_color as the global maximum in the grid; then collect unique colors strictly between 1 and max_color-1 (exclusive of 0 and max_color itself), sort them descending (e.g., if colors 1,2,3,4 and max=5, palette=[4,3,2,1]); cycle through this palette for each new component using component_id % len(palette), defaulting to 1 if palette empty.
 * Discovery order: Components are found and colored in strict raster order—scan rows left-to-right, top-to-bottom; only start a new flood fill on unvisited cells >4 encountered during this scan.
 * Preservation: All cells <=4 (including 0) stay exactly as in input; only >4 cells are overwritten during flood fill.
 * Subtlety: The input grid likely contains high values (>4) that form "blobs" or regions to be unified under one color per component, but the printed outputs suggest the original high values are not shown—focus on matching the expected recoloring patterns.
 * Potential miss: If max_color is low (e.g., 4), palette might be empty or limited, forcing fallback to color 1; ensure seen set correctly filters 0 < c < max_c.
 * Edge case: Grids may have isolated >4 cells or large components spanning multiple areas; raster order means earlier-discovered components get higher palette colors (since descending sort).
 * Another subtlety: Flood fill must mark visited to avoid recoloring the same component multiple times, but since it's BFS from the starting cell, this is handled if implemented correctly—however, mismatches suggest over- or under-flooding in complex shapes.
 * General: Outputs are 30x30 grids (based on list lengths), with many 0s as background; differences often occur in mid-to-lower rows, suggesting issues with later-discovered components or irregular shapes.
 * From attempts: The BFS flood fill works for simple/early components (e.g., top of train1 matches), but fails on irregular or adjacent components, possibly due to incorrect palette cycling or discovery order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy
from collections import deque

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Find the maximum color value in the grid."""
    if not grid or not any(grid):
        return 0
    return max(max(row) for row in grid if row)

def get_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract unique colors between 1 and max_color - 1, sorted descending."""
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = {c for row in grid for c in row if 0 < c < max_c}
    return sorted(seen, reverse=True)
```
These functions are helpful and correct for palette extraction—they accurately compute the cycling colors based on existing low values. Use them in future attempts.

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[bool]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    """Perform BFS flood fill on >4 connected cells (4-connectivity), coloring with given color."""
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
This flood fill is helpful and mostly correct (BFS with 4-connectivity, bounds checking, condition on g>4)—it succeeds for early/simple components but may fail on shape complexity; retain but verify against expected shapes.

The main program skeleton (deepcopy h=g, raster loop for discovery, cycling color assignment) is a good base but needs debugging for color assignment order.

No other functions from the attempt (e.g., no object extraction) are present or needed yet.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it partially understands the core mechanic of flood-filling >4 components with a cycled palette but fails both training examples.
 * What worked: Top sections of train1 (rows 0-4, 5-7? the solid lines of 4,3,1,2) match expected exactly, indicating correct preservation of <=4, correct early palette cycling (likely [4,3,2,1]), and functional flood fill for initial raster-discovered components.
 * What didn't work in train1: Mismatches start in lower rows (e.g., row 11: generated has a large 2-block where expected has 1's; row 12: generated 4's in positions expected as 1's; row 13: generated 1's shifted vs expected 4's and 1's; row 14: generated 1's where expected 4's; row 15: generated 1's/2's mismatched vs expected 1's/2's placements)—suggests wrong color assignment to later components, possibly due to incorrect component discovery order or palette cycling off-by-one (e.g., assigning 2 instead of 1, or treating separate components as one).
 * What didn't work in train2: More widespread mismatches (e.g., row 1: generated 3's where expected 2's; row 2: generated 3's in a block where expected 2's; rows 4-6: generated 3's/1's shifted vs expected 2's; lower rows like 9-11: generated 2's/3's where expected 3's/2's in different shapes; row 20: generated 1's where expected 3's)—indicates broader issues with component segmentation (e.g., merging adjacent regions incorrectly) or palette application (cycling to wrong colors like 3 instead of 2).
 * Overall: The attempt correctly implements raster order and BFS but likely errs in palette derivation (e.g., if max_c miscomputed, palette might include/exclude wrong colors) or visited tracking (causing partial fills); no evidence of handling empty palette or isolated cells perfectly.
 * Function `program` is the core but broken in color assignment for mid/late components—do not reuse without fixes; `flood_fill` is helpful but verify shapes manually.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but avoid assuming 8-connectivity or including <=4 in fills (easy miss).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the failed trainings (e.g., recoloring >4 cells with palette colors like 6,5,4,1, but likely wrong cycling/order since trainings failed).
 * Specific issues: Upper-left has 5's preserved (correct if <=4, but wait—5>4, so should be recolored; code preserves <=4 only, but output shows 5's in connected blocks, suggesting flood fill didn't trigger or palette includes 5 erroneously); mid-section (rows 8-16) has fragmented 5's/6's/1's that don't unify components cleanly (e.g., row 12 has scattered 6's where a large connected region might be expected to be one color); lower sections (rows 17-29) show 4's/1's/6's in irregular patterns that mismatch the unified blocks in trainings' expecteds (e.g., row 20 has a large 4-block, but adjacent 1's suggest improper segmentation).
 * It partially makes sense for simple areas (e.g., solid 1-row in row 5 preserved if <=4), but overall fails to unify >4 regions consistently—e.g., the 6's in rows 4-6/10-16 appear over-flooded or under-connected compared to expected uniform recoloring; without the test expected, it doesn't align with train patterns (e.g., no clear descending palette cycling visible).
 * To handle test: Ensure palette excludes any >4 originals (only 1 to max-1); debug discovery to catch vertical-spanning components early; the output's mix of high numbers (5,6) suggests the code isn't recoloring all >4 cells, possibly a bug in the condition (code checks g>4 correctly, but maybe input has values ==5 not flooding).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains "key" shapes (connected components of specific height, typically 3, with known colors and hole counts) that define a mapping from the number of holes in a shape to a target color, and this mapping is used to "decode" or recolor special shapes (likely color 5 components) by replacing them with the color corresponding to their hole count from the key. The goal is to output a transformed grid where decoded shapes are recolored appropriately, while leaving other parts unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-zero color; use DFS or stack-based flood fill to find them, tracking positions, bounding box (min/max row/col), height (max_r - min_r + 1), and size (number of cells).
 * Holes are defined as zero cells (empty space) that are fully enclosed; specifically, count individual 0 cells that have exactly 4 neighboring cells belonging to the component (up, down, left, right within bounds). This works for single-cell holes but fails for multi-cell holes (e.g., a 2x2 hole would have no 0 with 4 component neighbors, as inner 0's neighbor other 0's).
 * Key components for mapping are typically those with exact height 3 and not color 5; their hole count maps to their own color (e.g., a height-3 component with 1 hole and color 3 means mapping[1] = 3).
 * Only transform components that are color 5: compute their hole count h, and if h is in the mapping, recolor all cells in that component to mapping[h]; otherwise, set to 0 (erase). Do not transform other colors or non-height-3 keys.
 * Subtlety: The grid may have multiple components per color; ensure components are disjoint. Height is bounding box height, not actual shape height (e.g., a sparse vertical shape might have height 3 but not span all rows). Zeros outside components are background, not holes unless enclosed.
 * Easy to miss: Mapping is one-way (holes to color), and if no matching h, erase (set to 0), but in practice, all 5's should match a key. Grids have consistent width (30 columns here), and outputs must preserve structure (copy input, modify only targeted cells). Potential for diagonal connections? No, 4-way only. Multi-hole shapes or 0-holes (solid) must be handled; keys may include solid (h=0) or holed examples.
 * All considerations: Avoid counting non-enclosed 0's as holes (only those with n==4 component neighbors). Components may touch edges, so no wrapping. If a 0 is on edge, it can't have 4 neighbors anyway. Size may be used for validation (e.g., ignore tiny components), but not in this attempt. Transformed output must match expected exactly, including all 0's and unchanged areas.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implements connected component detection with stack-based flood fill, bounding box calculation, and height computation, which works for identifying key shapes and targets.
 * Hole counting works for single-cell enclosed 0's (e.g., detects the hole in the top "3" shape in ex1), but fails for larger/multi-cell holes since no 0 would have exactly 4 component neighbors (unhelpful for complex shapes; do not rely on it without fixes like flood-fill for enclosed regions).
 * Mapping logic uses only height==3 and non-color-5 components, which seems correct for keys (e.g., top of ex1 has height-3 shapes of colors 1,2,3,4 with h=0 or 1), but transformation only applies to color 5, assuming input has 5's in encoded areas.
 * In training example 1, generated output keeps original colors (e.g., 4's in rows 9-11, columns 3-5 and 9-11; 4's in rows 12-16 various positions) where expected changes them to 3's (rows 9-12, cols 3-5), 1's (rows 12-13, cols 20-25; rows 14-16, cols 18-20), and 2's (rows 20-23, cols 13-17), indicating no transformation occurred—likely because those areas are not color 5 in input, or hole counts didn't match mapping (unknown why, but difference is clear: unchanged vs. recolored to match key hole equivalents).
 * In training example 1, other differences: row 17 has 3's in cols 3-5 where expected has 3's (this matched, but isolated); row 19 has 3's where expected has 3's (partial match); row 27 has 4's where expected has 4's (unchanged parts correct), but overall ~70% mismatch in lower grid.
 * In training example 2, generated keeps 2's and 3's in upper/mid (e.g., rows 1-6 unchanged correctly), but lower areas like rows 9-16 have 2's/3's where expected has 3's (rows 9-16, cols 20-27 changed to 3's with holes); row 20 has 2's where expected has 3's (cols 20-24); row 23 has 3's where expected has 3's (partial); differences suggest transformation skipped or mapping wrong (e.g., h=0 mapped incorrectly, unknown reason).
 * In training example 2, bottom rows 23-27 have 3's in generated where expected has 3's in some spots but 0's/2's elsewhere (e.g., row 23 cols 0-3: 0's expected vs. 3's generated—over-transformation?); ~60% mismatch.
 * apply_color_transformation function is helpful for targeted recoloring but sets to 0 if no mapping, which may be correct but leads to mismatches if all should map.
 * The program copies the input grid to out, which is good for preserving unchanged areas, but since transformations fail, outputs resemble input too closely.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates partial understanding (components and holes) but broken application (no decoding in encoded areas).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be mostly unchanged from what is likely the input, with a vertical column of 1's (rows 0-29, col 24) unchanged, and patterned areas of 8's (rows 1-3, cols 26-28 with hole at row 2 col 27), 6's (rows 7-16, cols 26-28 with multiple single holes like row 8 col 27, row 10 col 27, etc.), and 4's (rows 17-27, cols 26-28 with holes like row 18 col 27) all preserved as-is, suggesting no recoloring happened.
 * If the puzzle requires decoding these patterned areas (assuming they are color 5 in input) based on hole counts matching a key (e.g., the 1's column might be a solid h=0 key implying color 1 for solids), the output should replace the 8/6/4 patterns with colors like 1 or others corresponding to their hole counts (e.g., 8's has 1 hole → map to color with 1 hole from key; 6's has ~4-5 single holes → multi-hole color), but instead they remain, making it invalid.
 * The repetitive height-3 patterns in 8/6/4 suggest they are encoded shapes awaiting transformation, but since only color 5 is targeted, if input uses other colors (e.g., 8,6,4 as "special" instead of 5), nothing changes—likely the core bug, as test mirrors training mismatches.
 * No erasures to 0 where unmapped, and top/bottom empty rows unchanged correctly, but lack of any decoding means it fails the puzzle's intent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-8 likely represent colors, 0 is empty, 5 is orange/special) where connected components (blobs) of the same color form "header" keys in the top section that encode mappings based on their shape (specifically, number of enclosed holes/empty spaces), and orange (5) blobs elsewhere must be transformed to match the color from the header with the equivalent hole count; if no match, they become empty (0).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (orthogonal only: up, down, left, right), not diagonal, and must be same color to connect.
 * Header candidates are limited to top-ish rows (min row <=4), exclude orange (5), require size >=5 cells, and are sorted left-to-right by minimum column to assign indices (0,1,2,... for mapping).
 * Hole counting is critical but tricky: it measures fully enclosed empty (0) regions within a component's bounding box, ignoring external empties or those touching other colors; must pad the subgrid to avoid border leaks, treat other colors as barriers (not traversable), and only count original-grid empties as valid holes (not artifacts).
 * Orange components are transformed only if their hole count matches a header index; otherwise, erase to 0; non-orange components stay unchanged.
 * Grid has dividers/bars (full rows of 1's or empties) separating sections (e.g., header, body, examples); preserve these.
 * Subtleties: Bounding box for holes must be tight but padded; flood fill starts from subgrid borders (including padding) to mark exterior empties; unvisited interior 0's that are original empties count as holes; components may span multiple rows/columns irregularly, so min/max row/col must be accurate; multiple oranges may exist, each transformed independently; headers might have holes formed by their own shape or adjacent empties, but not touching edges/other colors in ways that leak.
 * Easy to miss: Offset in subgrid mapping (e.g., sr = gr - minr +1) can shift positions wrongly; flood fill must not cross barriers (other colors=2); hole count=0 might map to first header; candidates might overlap or be mis-sorted if min-col ties; small/irregular oranges might have 0 holes but still need mapping; entire grid is 30 cols wide, variable height; preserve all non-orange, non-transformed cells exactly.
 * Across attempts: No multiple attempts shown, but this single attempt highlights need for robust hole detection (current flood fill buggy, overcounts/underestimates enclosures); consider diagonal leaks? No, 4-connect only; headers may not be solid blocks—holes from internal gaps.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

# Core: Finds all 4-connected components of same color, returns list of (color, list of (r,c) positions)
def find_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # Implementation as in attempt: DFS/stack-based, marks visited, groups by color.
    # This works well—correctly identifies blobs without issues in examples.
    pass  # (full code from attempt is solid, reuse it)
```

```python
# Attempts hole counting via subgrid + flood fill from borders.
# Helpful concept (enclosures via BFS/DFS on empties), but broken in practice: wrong offsets cause position shifts; flood treats padding correctly but miscounts if subgrid too small/large; only counts original 0's, which is good subtlety.
# Partially useful—fix offsets and validation for future.
def compute_holes(grid: List[List[int]], positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # Implementation as in attempt, but buggy (see below).
    pass  # (full code from attempt; debug offsets like offset_r=1, sr mapping)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly identifies components via find_components (blobs extracted accurately in generated outputs, e.g., header bars and body shapes preserved).
 * What worked: Header candidate selection (top rows, size>=5, exclude 5) and left-to-right sorting by min-col; transformation logic for oranges (replace if mapped, else 0); preserves non-oranges/dividers (e.g., full 1-rows intact in both trainings).
 * What didn't work: Hole computation is fundamentally flawed—underestimates or misidentifies enclosures, leading to wrong mappings (e.g., Train 1: orange blob around rows 9-16 should map to 3 based on 1 hole? but generates 1's/4's wrongly; positions shifted, like row9 col3-5 as 3 expected but 1 generated). Train 1 mismatches: row9 col3-5=1 gen vs 3 exp; row10 col2-3,5-6=1 gen vs 3 exp; row11 col8-9=4 gen but exp has 1's elsewhere misplaced; row12 col12-13=4 gen vs exp 4 but surrounding 1's wrong; many oranges not transformed or wrong color (e.g., bottom 4's unchanged, but exp has 3's/1's/2's in body). Train 2 mismatches: row8 col26-27 missing 3's; row9 col10-12=2 gen vs exp 2 but row10 col11-12=2 gen vs exp 2, but body oranges like row19-22 col21-25=3's missing in gen; row23-26 has extra/missing 3's placements (e.g., row23 col4-7=3 exp but absent in gen). Unknown why holes miscomputed—possibly subgrid offsets (offset_r/c=1) cause gr/gc out-of-bounds or wrong mapping, leading to 0 holes for all? Result: mappings empty or wrong (e.g., idx=0 maps nothing, oranges stay 5 or become 0 prematurely).
 * get_header_mapping sorts correctly but relies on bad holes, so empty dict often; transform_orange_components erases oranges without mapping (e.g., Train1 bottom oranges gone to 0, but exp has 2's/1's).
 * compute_holes is broken/not fully helpful (overly complex subgrid with wrong validation—counts non-original empties sometimes; suggest simplify to direct flood on full grid with barriers).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond that; find_components is essential and correct for extracting objects.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it partially transforms some oranges (e.g., col26-28 has 8/6/4 patterns suggesting hole-based mapping to 8,6,4), but many oranges remain 5 or unchanged (e.g., row1-6 col24-25=1's preserved but surrounding 5? implied not transformed; row17-30 col24=1's but body blobs like row18-26 col1-5/25-29 seem partially 4/6 but irregular, missing full enclosures). It looks like incomplete mapping: headers (top 1's, mid 6's/8's?) detected but holes wrong, so some oranges (e.g., sparse 1's in col24) stay, others half-transform (e.g., row8-16 col25=1 but exp likely full color fill); no erasures to 0 visible, suggesting mappings partial but not erasing unmatched. Why not correct: Similar to trainings, hole miscomputation likely assigns wrong indices (e.g., if all headers get 0 holes, only first maps, rest fail); test has more sparse/irregular blobs (e.g., dotted 8's/6's/4's), so bounding box leaks empties not enclosed; output has preserved 5? No, gen shows no 5's, all transformed or 1/0, but patterns don't match expected solid fills (e.g., row2 col26-29=8,8,8,0 vs likely solid 8 block). Account for test's dotted headers (holes from gaps) and vertical oranges needing precise enclosure check.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where cells with values ≤4 (including 0s and pre-colored 1-4) remain unchanged, while connected components of cells with values >4 are identified and recolored with cycling colors 1-4 based on the order in which the components are first discovered during a raster-order scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The goal is to produce a output grid that matches expected colorings for these components, likely representing some form of blob detection and labeling in a larger puzzle context, such as distinguishing shapes or regions in a nonogram-like or segmentation task.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed only from cells >4, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), treating ≤4 cells as barriers that cannot be crossed.
 * Discovery order for assigning colors is strictly raster: scan row 0 left-to-right, then row 1, etc.; the first unvisited >4 cell encountered starts a new component, which gets the next color in cycle (1 for first, 2 for second, 3 for third, 4 for fourth, then back to 1).
 * All cells in a component must be uniformly colored with the assigned color, replacing their original >4 value; no partial coloring or retention of original values.
 * Subtlety: Components may be non-contiguous in appearance due to ≤4 barriers, but the flood-fill must not leak across them; easy to miss if stack-based fill visits invalid neighbors.
 * Another subtlety: Large horizontal or vertical strips (e.g., entire rows of >4) form single components if connected, but scattered >4 cells separated by ≤4 are separate components discovered independently.
 * Input grids seem to contain pre-existing 1-4 colors in some areas (unchanged), suggesting the puzzle overlays new component coloring only on >4 regions without overwriting existing 1-4.
 * Potential miss: If input has isolated >4 cells or thin shapes, they each get their own color based on discovery position; over-merging components (e.g., via 8-connectivity) would incorrectly combine them.
 * Flood-fill must mark visited to avoid re-coloring; non-recursive stack is fine but must handle bounds correctly.
 * Overall puzzle likely tests understanding of image segmentation: >4 as "foreground" blobs to label sequentially.

                h[nx][ny] = color
                stack.append((nx, ny))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt uses correct structure for raster-order discovery and 4-connected flood-fill on >4 cells, leaving ≤4 unchanged, which works for basic component detection (e.g., upper regions in training 1 match expected for colors 4,3,1,2 in rows 1-3).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and colors some early-discovered components, like the vertical 4s in row1-3 col1-3, horizontal 3s in row1-3 col5-7, striped 1s in row1-3 col9-13, and long 2s in row1-3 col15-21; also handles full-row 1s in row5 perfectly.
 * What didn't work: Color assignments mismatch for later components due to apparent errors in discovery order or component merging; e.g., in training 1, a small 2x1 component in row8 col10-11 is colored 2 in generated but should be 4 in expected (suggesting it was discovered as the 4th component, not 2nd); similarly, lower-left 3s (rows9-11 col3-6) are correct but adjacent 2s in row10-11 col8-11 become 2s instead of expected 4s, indicating over-merging or skipped components.
 * In training 1, generated incorrectly colors a blob in rows12-16 col20-25 as mixed 4s and 1s, while expected has consistent 1s there, showing flood-fill didn't fully capture the component (possibly due to barriers or visit bugs).
 * In training 2, early components (2s/3s/1s in rows1-6) mostly match, but mid-grid mismatches like row9 col10-12 colored 4 instead of expected 2, and large 3-blob in rows9-25 col20-27 partially correct but with wrong cycling (e.g., row20 col20-24 as 3s but expected has splits into separate 3-components); lower 4s in rows23-27 also mismatched.
 * extract_objects not present in attempt, but could be helpful for debugging: a function to list component sizes/positions before coloring to verify discovery order.
 * The copy_grid and is_valid are helpful and correct; flood_fill is mostly helpful but subtly broken in handling large/irregular shapes (e.g., doesn't fully propagate in L-shapes or around 0-barriers in training 1 lower sections).
 * assign_colors_to_components is the core logic and helpful, but buggy in component ID cycling—perhaps off-by-one in (component_id % 4) + 1, or raster scan misses isolated cells.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, but flood_fill could be improved with queue (BFS) for consistent order vs stack (DFS), though DFS should work if visited is proper.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output applies the same logic, coloring >4 regions with 1-4 (e.g., large 3-blob in rows2-7 col1-7, 2s in rows4-6 col20-22, 1s scattered in col24, 4s in col26-28), leaving 0s and presumed pre-4s unchanged, which seems consistent with the attempt's approach.
 * It does not look fully correct based on training failures—e.g., the sprawling 3 in upper-left might be over-merged (rows2-7 col1-8 includes separated parts via row7 col4-6, but if 0s barrier, should split); similarly, mid-grid 2s in rows9-16 col16-23 appear as one big component but likely should cycle colors for sub-parts like the vertical in row15-16 col16-19 vs horizontal in row12 col13-16.
 * Lower 4s in rows17-30 col26-28 are consistent stripes, but interspersed 1s in col24 suggest correct isolation; however, without expected test output, hard to confirm, but mismatches like irregular 1-blob in rows20-29 col10-24 (jumping around) indicate flood-fill didn't connect properly (e.g., row22 col9-12 as 1s but separated by 0s from row24 col8-11).
 * Overall, test output follows the flawed pattern from training (partial matches in early/simple components, errors in complex/later ones), so likely incorrect in color order/merging; to fix, need to verify input grid's >4 positions mentally—e.g., if test has diagonal >4 connections, 4-connectivity fails.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of height values where cells greater than 4 ("high" cells) form connected components that must be colored using a cycling palette of [4, 3, 1, 2], while low cells (≤4) remain 0 in the output; the goal is to produce an output grid `h` that matches expected colorings for these components. The current program uses flood fill to identify and color 4-connected components in row-major order, but it fails to match expected outputs due to incorrect color assignments for specific components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * High cells (>4) are connected only via 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count, which is correctly implemented but may not explain all mismatches.
 * Components are discovered in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), assigning colors sequentially from the palette; this order leads to wrong colors in expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle may require a different discovery order (e.g., by component size, position, or sorted by starting coordinates) or non-cycling assignment rules.
 * Low cells (≤4) are preserved from the input grid in `h` but appear as 0 in all printed outputs, implying input low cells are already 0 or the printing normalizes them; however, the program correctly avoids overwriting them.
 * Palette cycles every 4 components: ID 0→4, 1→3, 2→1, 3→2, 4→4, etc.; mismatches occur when a component gets a color offset from expected (e.g., a component colored 2 in generated but 4 in expected), indicating ~2 fewer prior components in discovery or a shifted palette start.
 * Subtle element: Some components in expected outputs appear "split" or "merged" differently, but shapes match exactly across generated/expected—differences are purely in color values, not filled positions, so the issue is assignment logic, not connectivity or `is_high`.
 * All components, regardless of size, must be colored if they contain high cells; no omission based on size or holes (no evidence of hole-counting rules).
 * Grid size is square (e.g., 30x30 in examples), and output must exactly replicate expected structure, including isolated high cells as single-cell components.
 * Potential miss: Colors might be assigned based on the minimum row/column of the component's starting cell (e.g., sorted by topmost/leftmost position), or perhaps by component area/size descending, which would reorder discovery and fix color offsets.
 * Visually, outputs resemble "islands" or "blobs" of terrain heights, suggesting a map-coloring puzzle where adjacent blobs get different colors, but the cycling is fixed, not adjacency-based (no conflict resolution needed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def is_high(c: int) -> bool:
    return c > 4
```
(This correctly identifies cells to color; keep it.)

```python
def get_color(component_id: int) -> int:
    palette = [4, 3, 1, 2]
    return palette[component_id % len(palette)]
```
(This implements cycling but may need adjustment, e.g., different palette order [4,1,3,2] or non-modulo logic; currently helpful for basic assignment.)

```python
def flood_fill(h: List[List[int]], visited: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, color: int, size: int) -> None:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    h[start_i][start_j] = color
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and is_high(g[nx][ny]) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                h[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
(This performs correct 4-connected BFS flood fill on high cells only; essential and bug-free—keep and reuse.)

(The main `program` function is helpful as a skeleton: it deep-copies `g` to `h`, initializes visited, and iterates to find unvisited high cells, but the row-major iteration order causes color mismatches.)

(No extraction functions like for objects/holes were used or needed; the problem doesn't involve counting holes or extracting separate elements beyond components.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies and fills all high-cell components with consistent shapes matching expected (no shape errors), but assigns wrong colors due to discovery order—e.g., in Training 1, row 12 columns 12-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 14 columns 9-13 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), row 15 columns 9-12 are 2 (generated) vs. 4 (expected), suggesting a color offset of 2 for later components.
 * In Training 1, row 16 column 5 is 4 (generated) but 3 (expected); row 17-20 have 4 where expected has 3, indicating early components get shifted colors (e.g., second component colored 4 instead of 3).
 * In Training 2, row 1 columns 18-19 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected); row 2-7 have large 4-block where expected has 2, showing a major color shift for a prominent component; row 14 columns 12-14 are 4 (generated) but 2 (expected).
 * In Training 2, row 9 columns 10-12 are 1 (generated) but 2 (expected), a small isolated mismatch possibly from single-cell handling.
 * Overall, component discovery in row-major order works for finding all blobs but fails on color sequencing; no evidence of 8-connectivity needed, as shapes match.
 * Flood fill is efficient and correct (uses BFS via deque, marks visited to avoid overlaps); the issue is upstream in iteration order or palette application.
 * No unhelpful functions present—all provided (is_high, get_color, flood_fill) are relevant, though get_color's palette order may need tweaking (e.g., try [1,2,3,4] or sort starts by min_i then min_j explicitly).
 * Attempt demonstrates understanding of connected components but misses the key subtlety of color assignment rules, leading to consistent but offset colorings across both trainings.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed row-major discovery and cycling logic that failed both trainings, likely producing similar color offsets (e.g., early components may get 4 where expected has 3, or vice versa based on component count).
 * Specific issues: In the test output, a large 3-blob in rows 1-6 columns 1-7 appears overcolored as one component, but if expected splits or reorders it, colors like the 4 in row 4 column 20-22 may be wrong; similarly, the 2-blob in rows 2-4 columns 14-18 looks connected but may need different color if discovery order shifts.
 * The 1-column in rows 0-29 column 24 is consistently 1, which might be correct for an isolated vertical component, but if the palette cycles wrong, it could be expected as 4 or 2.
 * Scattered 4-blobs (e.g., rows 11-16 columns 20-29) dominate late, suggesting they get higher IDs and cycle back incorrectly; the output has mixed 2/4 in row 20-29, which visually resembles terrain islands but mismatches if expected uses position-based coloring.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense as colored high regions but fails the core rule of matching expected color patterns, as seen in trainings—e.g., the 3 in row 7 column 9-11 may be an offset from expected 1 or 2; without input g, hard to verify shapes, but assuming shapes are correct (per trainings), colors are likely wrong.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images or patterns where connected "objects" or blobs (likely defined by cell values above a threshold, such as >4) need to be identified and recolored using a cycling palette of lower colors (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc., derived from colors present in the grid excluding 0 and the maximum value), while strictly preserving all background and low-value patterns (≤4) without overwriting them. The goal appears to be simplifying or solid-filling these high-value blobs to create cleaner, colored shapes without expanding into surrounding areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components (4-directional adjacency) only for cells with values >4; low values (0-4) must remain untouched, including sparse or patterned arrangements like checkerboards, stripes, or isolated cells.
 * Palette is derived from unique colors in the grid that are >0 and < max color; assign colors cyclically to components (e.g., first component gets color 1, second gets 2, cycling back if more components than colors).
 * Do not fill bounding boxes—only recolor the exact cells in each connected component to avoid overwriting preserved low-value areas; this is a critical subtlety, as overfilling creates solid blocks where expected outputs show maintained sparsity or shapes.
 * Grids are square (e.g., 30x30 based on outputs), with 0 as background; high components may be irregular shapes, not rectangles, and filling must match their footprint exactly.
 * Subtle elements: Some "objects" in expected outputs appear to preserve internal low-value holes or patterns (e.g., 0's inside high areas stay 0), but high cells are uniformly recolored; components might touch but not merge if separated by low values; palette order seems sorted ascending (e.g., [1,2,3,...]).
 * Across attempts, note that max color varies (e.g., up to 4 in train1? but >4 threshold assumes higher); test has 1-6, so threshold >4 may work but confirm if it's > max low or fixed.
 * Preserve exact positions: Expected outputs show high areas replaced but low patterns (e.g., dotted lines of 1's or 2's) intact, unlike generated solid fills.
 * Easy to miss: Components are strictly >4 connected; isolated high cells are single-cell components; cycling palette means repeated colors for many components; no modification if no palette or no high components.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_max_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    return max((max(row) for row in grid), default=0)
```
(This correctly computes the max color for palette exclusion.)

```python
def get_appearance_palette(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    max_c = find_max_color(grid)
    seen = set()
    palette = []
    for row in grid:
        for c in row:
            if 0 < c < max_c and c not in seen:
                seen.add(c)
                palette.append(c)
    return palette
```
(This extracts a useful palette of intermediate colors, sorted by appearance; helpful for cycling assignments, though may need sorting if order matters.)

```python
def get_high_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    size = len(grid)
    visited = [[False] * size for _ in range(size)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if grid[i][j] > 4 and not visited[i][j]:
                positions = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    positions.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and grid[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(positions)
    return components
```
(This is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected components of >4 cells; uses DFS via stack, captures exact positions without expansion; key for identifying blobs to recolor.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies high components (>4 connected) and derives a palette, but fails by using bounding box filling, which expands recoloring into surrounding low-value areas (e.g., turns sparse patterns into solid blocks).
 * For train1: Generated large solid fills (e.g., full row 5 as all 1's; oversized 4/3/2 blocks in lower half overwriting 0's and patterns), differing from expected where upper patterns match but lower shows sparse recolored blobs (e.g., irregular 4's in rows 8-10, dotted 3's/1's/2's in rows 11-29, no full rows); unknown why palette cycling started with 4/3/1/2 instead of 1/2/3/4, but overfill is main issue.
 * For train2: Generated solid blocks (e.g., extended 1's into rows 1-7; oversized 2's/3's in lower half), differing from expected sparse recoloring (e.g., dotted 2's in rows 1-4, irregular 3's/1's in rows 20-29, no full solid rows); again, bounding box overfill destroys patterns.
 * fill_bounding_box is broken and unhelpful—creates rectangles that ignore component shape and overwrite lows; replace with exact-position filling (e.g., for pos in positions: new_grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] = color).
 * program overall partially works (copies grid, applies per component) but skips exact filling and may cycle palette incorrectly if not sorted.
 * No other attempts provided, but this shows partial understanding: component detection good, but filling/preservation bad.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows large solid blocks (e.g., rows 0-6 mostly 1's with some 5/4/6 intrusions; oversized 5's in rows 9-17; full rows of 6/4 in lower half), which likely overfills bounding boxes and overwrites sparse low patterns (e.g., isolated 1's and 6's in row 0, dotted 6's in row 1), unlike expected training outputs that preserve sparsity (e.g., dotted lines, irregular shapes). This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it homogenizes the grid too much—expected should have recolored high (>4, like 5/6) blobs exactly (e.g., small clusters of uniform color without expansion) while keeping 1/4 patterns intact; unknown exact input but overfill evident from blocky vs. patterned training expects.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a legend in the top rows (likely rows 1-3, 0-indexed) of a 30x30 grid maps the number of internal holes (enclosed empty regions) in colored bar segments to specific colors, and the task is to identify connected components of black cells (value 5) in the grid, compute the number of enclosed holes adjacent to each component (empty regions of 0's that do not connect to the grid border), and replace the component with the corresponding color from the legend mapping; if no mapping exists for the hole count, replace with 0 (empty).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend is extracted only from non-black (non-5) colored segments in rows 1-3 that have width >=3, where the color is taken from the first non-zero cell in row 2 of the segment, and the number of holes is the count of 0's strictly between the first and last non-zero cells in row 2 (gaps in the bar represent holes).
 * Black cells (5's) may appear in the legend rows themselves and are part of the puzzle to color, not part of the legend; legend extraction must skip segments where the extracted color is 5 to avoid contaminating the mapping with invalid entries like mapping[some_holes]=5.
 * Connected components of 5's are found via flood-fill (BFS/DFS) across 4 directions (up, down, left, right), treating only 5's as part of the component; other colors (1,2,3, etc.) and 0's block connectivity.
 * Holes are computed per component by identifying all adjacent 0 cells, then performing BFS on each unvisited connected empty region starting from those adjacents; a region is a hole only if its BFS does not reach any border cell (rows/cols 0 or 29), and each such disconnected empty region counts as exactly one hole regardless of size.
 * Empty regions (0's) are global in the sense that visited empties are marked per component's hole computation to avoid double-counting, but only regions adjacent to the specific component are considered (enclosed holes must touch the component).
 * If the hole count is not in the legend mapping, the entire component is set to 0; otherwise, set to the mapped color; existing non-5 cells in the grid (like pre-colored legend bars) are left unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Legend segments are separated by columns where all three rows (1-3) are 0; overlapping or adjacent segments must be handled by advancing col correctly after each.
 * Subtlety: Components may span the legend rows and main puzzle area, forming large connected 5-regions; hole detection must handle complex shapes where some "holes" may connect to the border via external 0's, making them non-holes.
 * Subtlety: The grid is 30x30, borders are rows/cols 0 and 29; empty regions touching these are not holes (open to outside).
 * General: Assume 0 is empty/white background; colors are positive integers (1,2,3,...); 5 is always black to replace; no diagonal connectivity.
 * From attempts: Hole BFS correctly uses deque for efficiency; visited arrays prevent reprocessing; deepcopy ensures input grid isn't modified externally.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core logic for legend extraction, component finding, and hole counting works when no 5's intrude into legend rows.
 * Training example 2 failed: the large connected 5-component spanning rows 1-7 (cols ~14-24) remained as 5's instead of being replaced with 2's; small 5's in row 1 cols 18-19 stayed 5's instead of 2's; row 7 cols 16-20 stayed 5's instead of 2's; this happened because legend extraction included the 5-segment in rows 1-3, setting mapping[0]=5 (or similar), causing the whole component to "color" to 5 and stay unchanged.
 * Other parts of training 2 worked: top-left 2-bar and 3-bar (with gap) were left as-is (pre-colored); bottom 3-blobs were correctly left or not processed (no 5's there); the 1's column was unchanged.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_legend_mapping, compute_holes, program) are core and helpful but buggy in legend skipping 5's; component extraction via BFS is essential and correct.
 * Subtle bug: Global col advancement in legend skips empty columns correctly but doesn't isolate legend from puzzle 5's in rows 1-3.
 * Unknown: Exact mapping for training 2 (likely 0 holes -> 2, 1 hole -> 3 based on bars), but hole count for big blob is probably 0 (no enclosed empties, just open shape), which should map to 2.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: multiple 5-components remain unchanged (e.g., top cluster rows 0-1 cols 9-11 stays 5's; mid-left rows 7-15 cols 9-11? stays 5's; bottom rows 17-28 cols 24? has 5's scattered but should be replaced), indicating same bug as training 2—legend extraction likely included 5-segments, mapping some holes to 5 and leaving components as 5's.
 * Incorrect colorings: Some areas colored to 8 (e.g., row 2 cols 15-18, row 3 col 13-15/19/26-28), 6 (rows 7-16 cols 26-28 with gaps), 4 (rows 17-28 cols 26-28 with gaps), but these may be overzealous mappings from contaminated legend; 1's column (col 24) stays 1's (correct, pre-colored).
 * Expected for test (mentally simulated): Legend likely maps 0->1? (solid bar), 1->8 (one gap), 2->6 (two gaps), 3->4 (three gaps) based on input patterns in rows 1-3; top 5-cluster (rows 0-1 cols 9-11) probably 0 holes -> color 1 but output has 5's (wrong); mid 5's (rows 7-15 cols 9-11?) likely enclosed holes -> 6 or 8 but output 5's (wrong); bottom 5's (rows 17-28 col 24? scattered vertical) probably 0 or 1 hole -> 1 or 8 but output mixes 5's and 4's incorrectly; all 5's should be replaced, no 5's in output.
 * Test highlights subtlety: Multiple separate 5-components with varying hole counts (e.g., some with gaps simulating 1-3 holes); contaminated mapping causes fallback to 5 instead of 0 or correct color.
 * Overall, test output shows incomplete replacement of 5's and possibly wrong colors (e.g., 4's in bottom may be partial, but 5's persistence confirms bug).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top rows (specifically rows 1-3) contain a legend that maps the number of holes (enclosed empty spaces) in shapes to specific colors, and the rest of the grid contains unidentified shapes made of the value 5 that must be replaced with the appropriate color from the legend based on their hole count; if no mapping exists, they default to 0 (empty).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend is extracted only from rows 1, 2, and 3 (0-based indexing), focusing on non-empty vertical spans in these rows that are at least 3 columns wide; it identifies the color in row 2 at the start of a filled segment and counts the number of 0-gaps (holes) between the first and last non-zero in row 2 to create a mapping from hole count to color—skipping spans if the color is 5, if the span is too narrow, or if there's no valid first/last in row 2.
 * Shapes are connected components of 5's (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right), found via BFS or DFS traversal starting from unvisited 5 cells.
 * Hole counting for a shape involves flooding from empty (0) cells adjacent to the shape's cells; each flood-fill of connected 0's that does not reach the grid border counts as one enclosed hole—requires a separate visited grid for empties to avoid recounting, and checks border reachability (rows/columns 0 or size-1).
 * Subtlety: Holes are only counted if fully enclosed by the shape (no border connection), but empty spaces connected to the border are not holes (they're outside); multiple holes per shape are possible if there are separate enclosed regions.
 * Default to 0 if a shape's hole count has no legend mapping; the grid is copied deeply to avoid modifying the input.
 * Edge cases: Empty components (0 holes), shapes touching the border (may affect hole enclosure), legend spans with all zeros in row 2 (skipped), or legend colors of 5 (skipped as invalid); grid size must be at least 4 for legend processing.
 * No diagonal connectivity for shapes or empties; only orthogonal.
 * Legend parsing skips leading/trailing empty columns and processes contiguous non-empty vertical blocks independently.

        mapping[num_holes] = color
        col = end_col + 1
    return mapping
```
Helpful for parsing the legend: identifies valid spans in rows 1-3, counts gaps in row 2 as holes, maps to starting color in row 2; skips invalid cases like width <3 or color=5.

Main program: combines legend mapping, component finding (BFS for 5's), hole counting, and replacement with mapped color (or 0).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, so no prior iterations to compare directly; however, the code demonstrates solid understanding of component extraction and hole flooding.
 * Legend mapping correctly handles skipping empty columns and narrow spans, but may miss if legend uses row 1 or 3 for hole indication (code only counts gaps in row 2).
 * Hole computation correctly identifies enclosed regions but starts floods only from cells adjacent to the component, which could miss isolated internal holes not touching the shape (though in standard topology, holes must be adjacent; potential subtlety if shapes have internal empties not adjacent).
 * Component finding via BFS is efficient and marks visited to handle disconnected shapes separately.
 * Deep copy ensures input grid isn't modified.
 * Training examples 1 and 2 passed correctly, indicating core logic works for simpler cases (likely smaller grids or standard hole counts).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and build toward the solution.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a vertical divider of 1's in column 24 across all rows, and three distinct patterned regions in columns 26-28: rows 1-6 have an irregular 8-filled shape (suggesting 0 holes mapped to 8), rows 7-16 have repeating 6-filled shapes with single gaps (suggesting 1 hole mapped to 6), and rows 17-28 have similar repeating 4-filled shapes with single gaps (suggesting 1 or 2 holes mapped to 4); rows 0 and 29 are mostly empty with 1's in col 24.
 * This looks partially correct based on inferred rules: different colors (8,6,4) for different hole counts aligns with legend mapping, and the divider of 1's is preserved (not 5's, so untouched); however, without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify if the 5-components were accurately replaced— the repeating patterns in lower sections suggest the program correctly identified multiple similar components, but the irregular top 8-shape (rows 1-6) has varying densities (e.g., row 2 has more 8's than row 5), which might indicate correct hole counting for a complex shape, or possibly over/under-counting if the input had touching components.
 * Potential issue: All lower patterns use the same color within their sections (6's and 4's), but if the test input had varying hole counts per shape, this uniform coloring might be wrong (e.g., if some shapes have 0 holes but got mapped to 1-hole color); the output defaults many cells to 0, which is correct for non-5 areas, but the legend extraction might have failed if the test legend was wider or used different row structures, leading to missing mappings (e.g., why 8,6,4 specifically?).
 * Overall, the test output makes sense structurally (colored regions separated, no 5's left, holes likely influencing colors), but subtle differences like uniform coloring in repeating sections could indicate the hole counter isn't distinguishing intra-section variations, or the legend mapping is too simplistic for the test's complexity—it's different from a "perfect" output if the test expects more granular per-shape coloring.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains a legend in the top rows (specifically rows 1-3) that maps the number of internal holes (gaps in a sequence) to specific colors, and the main task is to identify connected components (blobs) of the color 5 in the rest of the grid, count their enclosed empty (0) spaces that do not connect to the grid border, and recolor each blob with the corresponding color from the legend based on the hole count (or to 0 if no mapping exists).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The legend is extracted only from rows 1, 2, and 3; it ignores columns where all three rows are 0 and processes horizontal stretches of at least 3 consecutive columns with non-zero values in those rows.
 * In the legend, the number of holes is counted as the zeros in row 2 between the first and last non-zero cell in that stretch (ignoring single-cell or no-hole cases, and skipping color 5 entirely).
 * Blobs are 4-way connected components of exactly color 5; other colors (like dividers as 1's or pre-colored legend elements) are left unchanged.
 * Hole counting for blobs identifies fully enclosed empty (0) regions adjacent to the blob that do not reach any grid border, using flood-fill from adjacent 0's and checking if the flood reaches the edge; each such disconnected empty component counts as one hole (not the size of the empty area).
 * The grid size can vary but must be at least 4 for legend processing; copy the grid to avoid modifying the input.
 * Subtlety: Holes in legend are linear gaps in row 2, while blob holes are 2D enclosed areas; ensure flood-fill marks visited empties to avoid double-counting.
 * Subtlety: Blobs with 0 holes or unmapped hole counts become 0 (erased); legend skips invalid stretches (width <3, no gaps, or color 5).
 * Consider border-reaching empties as not holes (they are "open" spaces); multiple disconnected enclosed empties per blob each count separately.
 * Dividers (e.g., vertical column of 1's) and pre-existing non-5 colors (e.g., legend colors like 4,6,8) remain unchanged.
 * Grid is square (N x N), with left side often empty (all 0's) and right side containing the blobs separated by a divider.

Core function for 2D hole detection in blobs; uses BFS flood-fill per adjacent empty, checks border reach, and counts each non-border-connected empty component as one hole. Essential and correct.

The main `program` function orchestrates: deep-copies grid, gets mapping, finds 5-components via BFS, computes holes, applies mapping (default 0), recolors only the 5-cells. Helpful overall structure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided last (or only) submission; no prior attempts detailed, but the program correctly handles legend parsing for linear holes and 2D blob hole counting.
 * What worked: Successfully passed both training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of component detection, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the output recolors 5-blobs to 0 in many places (e.g., the repeating 6 and 4 patterns have internal 0's but are partially filled, suggesting possible over-erasure if hole counts didn't match legend), but legend colors (8,6,4) remain intact, and the top "8" shape looks properly colored while lower shapes appear as repeated patterns that might indicate mismatched hole counts (e.g., if blobs have varying holes but map to same or 0).
 * The vertical divider of 1's is correctly unchanged across the grid.
 * Hole counting seems accurate for enclosed areas, but may miss if empties are adjacent but not fully enclosed per component (unknown if this causes test mismatch).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (get_size, get_legend_mapping, compute_holes, program) are relevant and mostly correct, though compute_holes could be optimized to avoid revisiting the same empty from multiple blob cells (but it uses global visited, so it's fine).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 30x30 grid with left side all 0's, a vertical divider of 1's in column 24, and right side with three main sections: top (rows ~2-6) forming an "8"-like shape with internal 0's colored as 8's; middle (rows ~7-16) with repeating vertical "6"-like patterns (alternating 6 and 0) colored as 6's; bottom (rows ~17-28) with similar repeating "4"-like patterns colored as 4's.
 * It makes sense overall as the legend likely maps 0 holes to 8, 1 hole to 6, 2 holes to 4, and the shapes are blobs with those hole counts (top has no internal holes, middle has one gap per repeat, bottom two); empties remain 0, and no 5's left, indicating successful recoloring.
 * However, the repeating patterns in middle/bottom suggest multiple small blobs per "letter," and if any had unmapped holes, they became 0 (explaining solid fills with gaps); this looks correct and matches puzzle rules, but could be incorrect if the test expects merged components or different hole counting (e.g., if repeats are one big blob with more holes)—unknown without expected output, but no obvious errors like leftover 5's or wrong legend changes.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:37:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top three rows (1-3, 0-indexed) form a legend that maps the number of internal holes in example shapes to specific colors. The goal is to find connected components of unknown cells (marked as 5) in the full grid, calculate the number of fully enclosed empty regions (holes) within or adjacent to each component that do not touch the grid border, and replace the entire component with the corresponding color from the legend mapping (or 0 if no match).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legend extraction focuses on vertical column groups in rows 1-3 where at least one cell is non-zero and the group width is at least 3; skips narrow groups or those with color 5.
 * Hole count in legend is approximated by counting zero cells in row 2 (middle row) strictly between the first and last non-zero cell in row 2 for that group; this may miss holes in row 1 or 3 if they are not reflected in row 2.
 * Components of 5's are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); the entire component is replaced with a single color based on total holes.
 * Hole counting for components uses flood-fill on empty (0) cells adjacent to the component: each connected empty region that does not reach any grid border (rows/columns 0 or size-1) counts as one hole, regardless of size; global visited tracking prevents double-counting shared regions; only regions adjacent to the specific component are considered, potentially missing non-adjacent enclosures.
 * Empty regions touching the border (via flood-fill reaching border cells) are not holes, even if locally enclosed; this handles open spaces vs. true enclosures.
 * The grid may have pre-colored regions (non-5, non-0) that are left unchanged; vertical bars of 1's may act as dividers between legend and puzzle areas or multiple sections.
 * Subtle: tall or stacked shapes may form single large components with multiple internal holes (e.g., separated single-cell holes count individually if not connected via empties); border proximity can invalidate potential holes (e.g., bottom-most empty reaching row size-1).
 * If hole count not in mapping, replace with 0 (erasing the component); legend may have overlapping mappings (e.g., same color for different hole counts).
 * Grid size is variable but assumed square; all operations preserve the grid structure except for 5 replacements.

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def get_size(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return len(grid)
```
Basic utility to get grid dimensions.

```python
def get_legend_mapping(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    # Extracts mapping from rows 1-3 by finding column groups, counting zeros in row 2 between first/last non-zero in row 2.
    # Skips groups with width <3, no/ single bar in row 2, or color 5.
    # Returns {num_holes: color}
    size = get_size(grid)
    if size < 4:
        return {}
    r1 = grid[1]
    r2 = grid[2]
    r3 = grid[3]
    mapping: Dict[int, int] = {}
    col = 0
    while col < size:
        while col < size and r1[col] == 0 and r2[col] == 0 and r3[col] == 0:
            col += 1
        if col >= size:
            break
        start_col = col
        while col < size and not (r1[col] == 0 and r2[col] == 0 and r3[col] == 0):
            col += 1
        end_col = col - 1
        width = end_col - start_col + 1
        if width < 3:
            col = end_col + 1
            continue
        first = -1
        last = -1
        for c in range(start_col, end_col + 1):
            if r2[c] != 0:
                if first == -1:
                    first = c
                last = c
        if first == -1 or first == last:
            col = end_col + 1
            continue
        color = r2[first]
        if color == 5:
            col = end_col + 1
            continue
        num_holes = sum(1 for c in range(first + 1, last) if r2[c] == 0)
        mapping[num_holes] = color
        col = end_col + 1
    return mapping
```
Core function for legend parsing; useful but may undercount holes if they appear only in row 1/3.

```python
def compute_holes(grid: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # Counts enclosed empty regions adjacent to the component via flood-fill.
    # Regions reaching border do not count; uses global empty_visited to avoid double-counting.
    if not component:
        return 0
    size = get_size(grid)
    empty_visited = [[False for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    hole_count = 0
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    for x, y in component:
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and not empty_visited[nx][ny]:
                q = deque([(nx, ny)])
                empty_visited[nx][ny] = True
                reaches_border = False
                while q:
                    a, b = q.popleft()
                    if a == 0 or a == size - 1 or b == 0 or b == size - 1:
                        reaches_border = True
                    for ddx, ddy in directions:
                        na = a + ddx
                        nb = b + ddy
                        if 0 <= na < size and 0 <= nb < size and grid[na][nb] == 0 and not empty_visited[na][nb]:
                            empty_visited[na][nb] = True
                            q.append((na, nb))
                if not reaches_border:
                    hole_count += 1
    return hole_count
```
Accurate hole counter for components; handles connected empties correctly and border checks.

```python
def find_and_replace_components(grid: List[List[int]], mapping: Dict[int, int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Finds 4-connected components of 5's, computes holes, replaces with mapping.get(holes, 0).
    size = get_size(grid)
    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    visited = [[False for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    for r in range(size):
        for c in range(size):
            if result[r][c] == 5 and not visited[r][c]:
                component = []
                q = deque([(r, c)])
                visited[r][c] = True
                component.append((r, c))
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size and result[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            component.append((nx, ny))
                h = compute_holes(result, component)
                color = mapping.get(h, 0)
                for x, y in component:
                    result[x][y] = color
    return result
```
Main replacement logic; only targets 5's, leaves other colors intact.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt; it successfully solved training example 1 and 2, demonstrating correct legend extraction, component detection, hole counting via flood-fill, and replacement of 5's based on mapping.
 * Worked well for simple cases where mappings matched hole counts and components had clear enclosures not touching borders.
 * Potential limitation: legend hole counting only checks row 2, which may miss enclosures in row 1 or 3 (e.g., zeros in row 3 under solid row 2 would not be counted, possibly leading to inaccurate mappings in complex legends).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions identified; all provided functions (get_legend_mapping, compute_holes, find_and_replace_components) are relevant and functional, though legend extraction could be enhanced to flood-fill the full 3-row group for true hole count.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training; the approach correctly ignores non-5 cells and handles visited tracking to avoid overcounting.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a vertical divider of 1's in column 24 across all rows, separating left and right sections; top rows (0-3) have sparse 8's in columns 13-18 and 26-28 forming legend-like patterns, with no 5's visible.
 * A complex 8-colored blob in rows 2-6, columns ~13-22, likely a replaced 5-component with 0 holes matching mapping[0]=8; this appears correct if input had 5's there.
 * Right side (columns 26-28) has two tall stacked patterns: rows 7-15 filled with 6's in a repeating full/holed/full motif (4 enclosed single-cell holes at rows 8,10,12,14 col 27, all internal); rows 17-28 with identical but longer 4's pattern (5 enclosed holes at rows 18,20,22,24,26 col 27, as row 28 col 27 empty reaches border via row 29 and is not counted).
 * The 6's and 4's regions retain their colors, indicating they were pre-colored in input (not 5's), so correctly left unchanged; if they were 5's, the code would have replaced both to 0 (since mapping lacks 4 or 5), but output has distinct 6/4, suggesting no replacement needed and output matches expected (pre-colored blobs with different hole counts but not unknowns).
 * Overall, the test output makes sense: no visible 5's post-replacement, legend intact with 8's (mapping {0:8, 1:8}), upper blob replaced to 8, lower regions as fixed colors; subtle border effect correctly would de-enclose the bottom hole in 4's if it were a 5-component, but since pre-colored, irrelevant.
 * No obvious errors; the distinct 6/4 for similar-but-differing-hole-count structures (4 vs 5 holes) highlights puzzle subtlety in connectivity and border rules, but output aligns with rules assuming pre-colored inputs.
