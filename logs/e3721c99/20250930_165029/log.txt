=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 16:50:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
import collections

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    color_idx = 0
    dirs = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(w):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                col = color_cycle[color_idx % 4]
                color_idx += 1
                q = collections.deque([(r, c)])

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-09-30 17:05:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where cells with values greater than 4 represent parts of "objects" or blobs that need to be identified as connected components and recolored with distinct labels from 1 to 4, while cells with values 0-4 remain unchanged. The goal is to match specific expected color assignments for each component, likely following rules for 4-way connectivity and a particular order of discovery or assignment that cycles through colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right), treating cells >4 as fillable and cells <=4 (including 0) as barriers or empty space that cannot be crossed.
 * Coloring uses a cycle of 1-4, but the exact order (e.g., starting with 4 descending to 1, or ascending 1-4) and discovery order (row-major traversal) must match expected to avoid mismatches in later components; subtle element: the cycle wraps around (mod 4), but if the starting sequence is wrong, it cascades errors to subsequent blobs.
 * Components must be fully replaced with a single color per blob, but only if they are >4 initially; do not color or alter <=4 cells.
 * Order of processing cells (row by row, left to right) determines discovery order, which affects color assignment—early blobs get first colors, but if cycle is inverted or offset, mid-to-late blobs mismatch (e.g., a blob expected as 1 gets 2).
 * Subtle: Blobs may be separated by 0s or low numbers, and flood fill must not leak across them; also, isolated >4 cells count as single-cell components needing their own color.
 * No 8-way connectivity—sticking to 4-way prevents over-merging diagonal touches.
 * All components get colors from 1-4, cycling as needed, but expected outputs suggest a specific sequence like 4,3,1,2 for first few, then continuing differently, implying the cycle might not be simple descending or the discovery order needs sorting by position/size.
 * Empty or all-0 rows/areas stay 0; full rows of 1s in expected (e.g., row 5 in train1) suggest pre-colored or special cases, but program shouldn't alter them since <=4.
 * Potential miss: If input has varying >4 values (e.g., 5,6,...), they all get unified to one color per component, ignoring original value beyond the >4 threshold.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implemented 4-way BFS flood fill to identify and unify connected >4 cells into single colors, which worked for the top blobs in train1 (e.g., rows 1-3 matched expected 4,3,1,2 assignments) and some isolated areas, showing good handling of barriers and component isolation.
 * Color cycle [4,3,2,1] with row-major discovery partially worked for initial blobs but failed to match expected cycle—e.g., in train1, third blob (1's in row1) was assigned 1 in generated but code logic suggests it should be 2, indicating possible execution mismatch or cycle bug; this led to cascade errors.
 * In train1, lower blobs mismatched: row11 right blob colored 2 in generated vs. expected 1; row12 had 1 and 2 vs. expected 4 and 1; row13 had 1's where expected 4's; row14-16 showed fragmented 1's and 4's vs. more unified 4's and 1's in expected—likely due to wrong cycle offset causing later colors to shift (e.g., a component expected as 4 got 1).
 * In train2, top blobs partially matched (2,3,1 for first three), but mid-grid mismatches like row11-12 had incorrect 3's and 1's placements vs. expected 2's and 3's; lower areas (e.g., row20-22) had scattered 3's vs. unified patterns, and row23-24 introduced unwanted 2's where expected 3's—suggesting over-connecting or cycle misalignment.
 * Visited matrix and deque BFS were effective and not broken, avoiding infinite loops or partial fills.
 * No extraction of object properties (e.g., size, position) was used, which might be needed if colors depend on blob attributes rather than pure discovery order—current attempt assumed simple cycling, missing this subtlety.
 * The program handled empty grids/rows correctly (returns unchanged), but didn't account for potential need to sort components (e.g., by top-left position or size) before assigning colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same issues from training failures: fragmented and mismatched color assignments, e.g., scattered 1's in columns 14-24 across rows 2-29 suggest over-splitting or wrong cycling, while large 3-blobs in rows 2-7 and 8-16 look unified but likely offset (e.g., early 3's might be expected as 4's based on train patterns).
 * It shows good flood fill for some areas (e.g., solid 4's in row10 cols17-20, 2's in row20 cols0-5), but others are incorrect, like row11 having mixed 3's and 4's where expected might unify differently, and row25-29 having dense 1's and 4's that appear over-colored compared to train expectations of sparser patterns.
 * Overall, colors cycle through 1-4 but in a way that doesn't align with train expecteds (e.g., heavy use of 1's for vertical strips in col24, which might need 2 or 3); without the test input grid, can't verify connectivity, but the output has too many small 1/2 fragments (e.g., row22 col9 isolated 1's), suggesting possible under-merging or cycle causing visual inconsistency—does not make sense as a correct solution since trainings failed similarly.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

[2025-09-30 17:13:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving flood-filling connected components of uncolored cells (values >4) with colors 1-4 in a cycling order based on discovery sequence during a row-major scan, while preserving pre-existing cells (<=4, including 0 and pre-colored 1-4). The goal is to correctly identify and color 4-way (or possibly 8-way) connected blobs of >4 cells, but only applying colors to sufficiently large components or following subtle connectivity and ordering rules to match expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are discovered in strict row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), starting flood fill only on unvisited cells with value >4; small components (size <=4?) may need to be skipped or handled differently, as the current code colors everything, leading to index offsets in color cycling.
 * Color cycle is [4, 3, 1, 2] based on 0-based component discovery index (e.g., index 0=4, 1=3, 2=1, 3=2, 4=4), which matches early components but fails later, suggesting possible merges, skips, or different connectivity (e.g., 8-way instead of 4-way, causing fewer components and shifted indices).
 * Preserve all cells <=4 unchanged (0 as empty, 1-4 as pre-colored); only modify >4 cells during flood fill, and ensure flood fill spreads only to adjacent >4 cells (currently 4-way: up/down/left/right, but diagonals might connect components in expected outputs).
 * Potential subtlety: Only color components with size >4 cells; current code lacks size check, coloring all (even tiny ones), which may increment the component index prematurely and shift later colors (e.g., a small blob colored as index 3=2 instead of skipping it).
 * No alteration to grid structure; output must be same dimensions, with all >4 replaced by 1-4 per rules, and no >4 remaining in output (expected outputs show all <=4).
 * Discovery must mark visited correctly to avoid re-coloring; current visited is per cell, which is good, but if small components are skipped, visited might still need updating without coloring.
 * Subtle: Pre-colored cells (1-4) might block connectivity, and 0s are empty (non-blocking but not fillable); ensure flood fill doesn't cross <=4.
 * Overall, early/top components match expected, but mid-to-lower grid mismatches suggest ordering issues from unmerged or extra components.

                # For small, leave as >4 but since expected has no >4, this may not work; perhaps color small differently or error
    return g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt uses 4-way flood fill on all >4 components in row-major order with cycle [4,3,1,2], which correctly colors early/top components (e.g., train 1 rows 1-3 match expected with 4/3/1/2 blobs) but fails on later/mid-grid components due to color shifts (e.g., train 1 row 12: generated 2,2 at cols 12-13 vs expected 4,4; row 13: generated 2,2,2 vs 4,4,4; row 16: generated 4 vs expected 3 at col 5).
 * Train 1 mismatches propagate: a presumed extra small component colored early increments index, causing later blobs (e.g., the 4-blob in rows 12-15) to get index 3 (color 2) instead of index 4 (color 4); similar in row 20-21 where generated has 3's but expected has 2's in some spots (unknown exact cause, possibly unmerged components).
 * Train 2 mismatches similarly: early matches (rows 1-3: 2/3/1 patterns), but later shifts (e.g., row 4 generated has 4's in large blob cols 13-25 vs expected 2's; row 14 generated 4's vs expected 2's; row 20 generated 4's in cols 11-14 vs expected 2's), suggesting same index offset from extra colored components or wrong connectivity (4-way misses diagonal merges, creating more components than expected).
 * preserve_cells_le_4 is redundant/unhelpful (implicitly handled by targeting only >4; remove to simplify).
 * flood_fill_component is mostly helpful but broken without size check or 8-way option; it colors all components, leading to extra index increments for small blobs.
 * select_color is correct for cycle but unhelpful if discovery order is off due to connectivity or skips.
 * deepcopy in program is helpful for non-mutating input.
 * No extraction functions used; consider adding component_size to identify large-only coloring, as small components may need skipping (but expected has no >4 left, so unclear—possibly color small with different rule or all are large in examples).
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of scan order and cycle but misses subtlety of component size threshold (>4 cells?) or 8-way connectivity, causing cumulative index errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed logic as the incorrect training examples (colors all >4 components with 4-way fill and cycle [4,3,1,2]), likely suffering from index shifts on later components (e.g., large blob in rows 2-6 colored 3's correctly early, but row 9-16 has mixed 2/3/4's that may shift if small components were skipped or merged in expected; row 17-29 has 1/2/4 patterns that appear over-colored without size check).
 * Specific issues: Assumed early components (e.g., row 1-2 3's and 4's) might match if input similar, but mid-grid (rows 8-16) shows fragmented 2/3/4 coloring around what looks like a large connected area (possibly should merge to fewer colors like 1 or 2 if 8-way); lower rows 18-29 have 1/2/4 but expected likely cycles cleanly without extras (e.g., row 23 generated 4's in cols 1-2 but may be part of larger 2-blob above).
 * Test output is overzealous in coloring (no size filter), and lacks diagonal connectivity consideration, leading to more components than expected; it "makes sense" under the attempt's rules but not the puzzle's, as trains failed similarly—does not account for potential large-component-only rule or 8-way to reduce component count and fix cycle.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where cells with values greater than 4 represent parts of "objects" or blobs that need to be identified as connected components and recolored with distinct labels from 1 to 4, while cells with values 0-4 remain unchanged. The goal is to match specific expected color assignments for each component, likely following rules for 4-way connectivity and a particular order of discovery or assignment that cycles through colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right), treating cells >4 as fillable and cells <=4 (including 0) as barriers or empty space that cannot be crossed.
 * Coloring uses a cycle of 1-4, but the exact order (e.g., starting with 4 descending to 1, or ascending 1-4) and discovery order (row-major traversal) must match expected to avoid mismatches in later components; subtle element: the cycle wraps around (mod 4), but if the starting sequence is wrong, it cascades errors to subsequent blobs.
 * Components must be fully replaced with a single color per blob, but only if they are >4 initially; do not color or alter <=4 cells.
 * Order of processing cells (row by row, left to right) determines discovery order, which affects color assignment—early blobs get first colors, but if cycle is inverted or offset, mid-to-late blobs mismatch (e.g., a blob expected as 1 gets 2).
 * Subtle: Blobs may be separated by 0s or low numbers, and flood fill must not leak across them; also, isolated >4 cells count as single-cell components needing their own color.
 * No 8-way connectivity—sticking to 4-way prevents over-merging diagonal touches.
 * All components get colors from 1-4, cycling as needed, but expected outputs suggest a specific sequence like 4,3,1,2 for first few, then continuing differently, implying the cycle might not be simple descending or the discovery order needs sorting by position/size.
 * Empty or all-0 rows/areas stay 0; full rows of 1s in expected (e.g., row 5 in train1) suggest pre-colored or special cases, but program shouldn't alter them since <=4.
 * Potential miss: If input has varying >4 values (e.g., 5,6,...), they all get unified to one color per component, ignoring original value beyond the >4 threshold.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implemented 4-way BFS flood fill to identify and unify connected >4 cells into single colors, which worked for the top blobs in train1 (e.g., rows 1-3 matched expected 4,3,1,2 assignments) and some isolated areas, showing good handling of barriers and component isolation.
 * Color cycle [4,3,2,1] with row-major discovery partially worked for initial blobs but failed to match expected cycle—e.g., in train1, third blob (1's in row1) was assigned 1 in generated but code logic suggests it should be 2, indicating possible execution mismatch or cycle bug; this led to cascade errors.
 * In train1, lower blobs mismatched: row11 right blob colored 2 in generated vs. expected 1; row12 had 1 and 2 vs. expected 4 and 1; row13 had 1's where expected 4's; row14-16 showed fragmented 1's and 4's vs. more unified 4's and 1's in expected—likely due to wrong cycle offset causing later colors to shift (e.g., a component expected as 4 got 1).
 * In train2, top blobs partially matched (2,3,1 for first three), but mid-grid mismatches like row11-12 had incorrect 3's and 1's placements vs. expected 2's and 3's; lower areas (e.g., row20-22) had scattered 3's vs. unified patterns, and row23-24 introduced unwanted 2's where expected 3's—suggesting over-connecting or cycle misalignment.
 * Visited matrix and deque BFS were effective and not broken, avoiding infinite loops or partial fills.
 * No extraction of object properties (e.g., size, position) was used, which might be needed if colors depend on blob attributes rather than pure discovery order—current attempt assumed simple cycling, missing this subtlety.
 * The program handled empty grids/rows correctly (returns unchanged), but didn't account for potential need to sort components (e.g., by top-left position or size) before assigning colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same issues from training failures: fragmented and mismatched color assignments, e.g., scattered 1's in columns 14-24 across rows 2-29 suggest over-splitting or wrong cycling, while large 3-blobs in rows 2-7 and 8-16 look unified but likely offset (e.g., early 3's might be expected as 4's based on train patterns).
 * It shows good flood fill for some areas (e.g., solid 4's in row10 cols17-20, 2's in row20 cols0-5), but others are incorrect, like row11 having mixed 3's and 4's where expected might unify differently, and row25-29 having dense 1's and 4's that appear over-colored compared to train expectations of sparser patterns.
 * Overall, colors cycle through 1-4 but in a way that doesn't align with train expecteds (e.g., heavy use of 1's for vertical strips in col24, which might need 2 or 3); without the test input grid, can't verify connectivity, but the output has too many small 1/2 fragments (e.g., row22 col9 isolated 1's), suggesting possible under-merging or cycle causing visual inconsistency—does not make sense as a correct solution since trainings failed similarly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-09-30 17:23:01] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
import collections
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def select_color(i: int) -> int:
    cycle = [4, 3, 1, 2]
    return cycle[i % 4]

def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, col: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> None:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    q = collections.deque([(r, c)])
    visited[r][c] = True
    g[r][c] = col
    dirs = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()
        for dx, dy in dirs:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                g[nx][ny] = col
                q.append((nx, ny))

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    g = deepcopy(g)
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return g
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    component_index = 0
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(w):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                col = select_color(component_index)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 17:24:03] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid where cells with values greater than 4 represent uncolored regions or "blobs" that must be identified as connected components (using 4-way connectivity) and then recolored with specific values 1-4 according to some rule-based assignment, while preserving 0s as background and not altering pre-colored cells (1-4). The goal is not simple sequential coloring in discovery order but likely depends on properties like component position, size, shape characteristics (e.g., holes, enclosure), or spatial relationships to match a target pattern, as evidenced by consistent shape preservation but color mismatches in outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only include cells >4 initially; 0s are barriers, and pre-existing 1-4 cells are not part of components or altered.
 * Color assignment is not based on row-major discovery order (which leads to cycling through 4,3,1,2 and mismatches); instead, it appears to follow a specific mapping, possibly by component location (e.g., top-to-bottom or left-to-right priority), size (larger first), or topological features like enclosure/holes (e.g., some components get 4 if they form "frames" or outer shapes).
 * Subtlety: Some components span multiple areas but are split correctly in expected outputs, suggesting no diagonal connectivity (8-way would merge unintended blobs); ensure flood fill strictly uses 4 directions.
 * Expected outputs reuse colors non-sequentially (e.g., multiple 1s, 2s), but adjacent components never share colors if they touch, hinting at a graph-coloring-like constraint with a fixed palette, though not enforced by adjacency alone (since simple cycling fails).
 * Grids have irregular shapes with empty rows/columns (all 0s), and components may be isolated or nested; preserve exact boundaries—any over/under-filling breaks shapes.
 * Potential miss: Components with "holes" (enclosed 0s) might get specific colors (e.g., 4 for outer frames in training 1 lower section); count internal 0s or perimeter to classify.
 * Order of processing matters: Scanning top-to-bottom left-to-right finds components in wrong sequence for color assignment; perhaps sort components by min-row, min-col, or area descending before coloring.
 * Edge case: Empty grid or no components >4 should return unchanged; single-cell components need correct color based on rule.
 * Visual puzzle aspect: Outputs resemble "paint-by-numbers" or region-coloring where colors form letters/shapes (e.g., training 1 upper has patterned 4-3-1-2 like a banner); test for semantic meaning like "flags" or "symbols" per region.

            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

                g[nx][ny] = col
                q.append((nx, ny))

    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # Sort by position; could sort by area for rule testing
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and fills connected components (shapes match expected in both training examples, e.g., upper banner-like blobs in training 1 rows 1-3 and full row 5 all 1s), confirming 4-way flood fill works without over-merging or boundary errors.
 * Failed on color assignment: Uses rigid cycle [4,3,1,2] in discovery order, leading to mismatches like in training 1 row 13 (generated 2,2 vs expected 4,4 for a vertical-ish blob) and row 15 (generated 2 vs expected 4 for extended horizontal); similar in row 14 (2 vs 4).
 * In training 1, lower sections (rows 8-16) show generated assigning 2/4 incorrectly to what seem like frame-like or enclosed components, while expected uses 4 for outers and 1/2 for inners—suggests rule favors 4 for "boundary" or larger/perimeter-heavy blobs.
 * Training 2 mismatches include row 1 (generated 4,4 in right but expected 2,2), row 3 (generated 4 vs expected 2 for extension), and row 14 (generated 4 vs expected 2 for small blob), indicating discovery order hits smaller/top components first but expected prioritizes by position or type (e.g., 2 for clustered extensions).
 * No extraction of component properties (e.g., size, holes) in attempt, which is essential for rule discovery; simple scanning misses reordering needs.
 * Cycle [4,3,1,2] starts correctly for top blobs but breaks lower (unknown why expected reuses 4 for non-adjacent but positionally similar shapes); adjacency not the issue as non-adjacent get same color.
 * deepcopy and visited matrix are correct/necessary to avoid mutating input.
 * No unhelpful functions in attempt—all are relevant, but select_color is broken for puzzle (too simplistic; replace with property-based mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves component shapes correctly (e.g., large 3-blob in rows 2-6 left, scattered 1s in right columns, 2/4 clusters bottom), but colors appear arbitrary/inconsistent with training patterns—e.g., top 4s in row 0-1 seem like small frames but get 4 (matches training outer rule?), yet mid 2s in rows 3-6 look like expected 3/4 in similar positions but are 2, suggesting same discovery-order flaw.
 * Does not look fully correct: Right-side 1s (rows 0-29 col 24+) form vertical lines but include isolated 1s where expected might merge or recolor based on enclosure (e.g., row 2 col 26-29 has 1,0,1,0 pattern, possibly should be uniform if connected via rule); bottom 2s (rows 23-29) overextend with 2 where training suggests 4 for horizontals.
 * Missing rule handling: Test has nested/complex blobs (e.g., row 11-15 4s with internal 0s), but generated cycles to 4/2 without checking holes/perimeter, likely mismatching expected (e.g., inner 0s in col 13-19 should influence color to 1 like training inners).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for shapes but not colors—looks like sequential assignment gone wrong, e.g., early 3 for large top blob (good) but later 4/2 swaps ignore positional priority seen in training.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 17:24:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving flood-filling connected components of uncolored cells (values >4) with colors 1-4 in a cycling order based on discovery sequence during a row-major scan, while preserving pre-existing cells (<=4, including 0 and pre-colored 1-4). The goal is to correctly identify and color 4-way (or possibly 8-way) connected blobs of >4 cells, but only applying colors to sufficiently large components or following subtle connectivity and ordering rules to match expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are discovered in strict row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), starting flood fill only on unvisited cells with value >4; small components (size <=4?) may need to be skipped or handled differently, as the current code colors everything, leading to index offsets in color cycling.
 * Color cycle is [4, 3, 1, 2] based on 0-based component discovery index (e.g., index 0=4, 1=3, 2=1, 3=2, 4=4), which matches early components but fails later, suggesting possible merges, skips, or different connectivity (e.g., 8-way instead of 4-way, causing fewer components and shifted indices).
 * Preserve all cells <=4 unchanged (0 as empty, 1-4 as pre-colored); only modify >4 cells during flood fill, and ensure flood fill spreads only to adjacent >4 cells (currently 4-way: up/down/left/right, but diagonals might connect components in expected outputs).
 * Potential subtlety: Only color components with size >4 cells; current code lacks size check, coloring all (even tiny ones), which may increment the component index prematurely and shift later colors (e.g., a small blob colored as index 3=2 instead of skipping it).
 * No alteration to grid structure; output must be same dimensions, with all >4 replaced by 1-4 per rules, and no >4 remaining in output (expected outputs show all <=4).
 * Discovery must mark visited correctly to avoid re-coloring; current visited is per cell, which is good, but if small components are skipped, visited might still need updating without coloring.
 * Subtle: Pre-colored cells (1-4) might block connectivity, and 0s are empty (non-blocking but not fillable); ensure flood fill doesn't cross <=4.
 * Overall, early/top components match expected, but mid-to-lower grid mismatches suggest ordering issues from unmerged or extra components.

 * The single previous attempt uses 4-way flood fill on all >4 components in row-major order with cycle [4,3,1,2], which correctly colors early/top components (e.g., train 1 rows 1-3 match expected with 4/3/1/2 blobs) but fails on later/mid-grid components due to color shifts (e.g., train 1 row 12: generated 2,2 at cols 12-13 vs expected 4,4; row 13: generated 2,2,2 vs 4,4,4; row 16: generated 4 vs expected 3 at col 5).
 * Train 1 mismatches propagate: a presumed extra small component colored early increments index, causing later blobs (e.g., the 4-blob in rows 12-15) to get index 3 (color 2) instead of index 4 (color 4); similar in row 20-21 where generated has 3's but expected has 2's in some spots (unknown exact cause, possibly unmerged components).
 * Train 2 mismatches similarly: early matches (rows 1-3: 2/3/1 patterns), but later shifts (e.g., row 4 generated has 4's in large blob cols 13-25 vs expected 2's; row 14 generated 4's vs expected 2's; row 20 generated 4's in cols 11-14 vs expected 2's), suggesting same index offset from extra colored components or wrong connectivity (4-way misses diagonal merges, creating more components than expected).
 * preserve_cells_le_4 is redundant/unhelpful (implicitly handled by targeting only >4; remove to simplify).
 * flood_fill_component is mostly helpful but broken without size check or 8-way option; it colors all components, leading to extra index increments for small blobs.
 * select_color is correct for cycle but unhelpful if discovery order is off due to connectivity or skips.
 * deepcopy in program is helpful for non-mutating input.
 * No extraction functions used; consider adding component_size to identify large-only coloring, as small components may need skipping (but expected has no >4 left, so unclear—possibly color small with different rule or all are large in examples).
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of scan order and cycle but misses subtlety of component size threshold (>4 cells?) or 8-way connectivity, causing cumulative index errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed logic as the incorrect training examples (colors all >4 components with 4-way fill and cycle [4,3,1,2]), likely suffering from index shifts on later components (e.g., large blob in rows 2-6 colored 3's correctly early, but row 9-16 has mixed 2/3/4's that may shift if small components were skipped or merged in expected; row 17-29 has 1/2/4 patterns that appear over-colored without size check).
 * Specific issues: Assumed early components (e.g., row 1-2 3's and 4's) might match if input similar, but mid-grid (rows 8-16) shows fragmented 2/3/4 coloring around what looks like a large connected area (possibly should merge to fewer colors like 1 or 2 if 8-way); lower rows 18-29 have 1/2/4 but expected likely cycles cleanly without extras (e.g., row 23 generated 4's in cols 1-2 but may be part of larger 2-blob above).
 * Test output is overzealous in coloring (no size filter), and lacks diagonal connectivity consideration, leading to more components than expected; it "makes sense" under the attempt's rules but not the puzzle's, as trains failed similarly—does not account for potential large-component-only rule or 8-way to reduce component count and fix cycle.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where cells with values greater than 4 represent parts of "objects" or blobs that need to be identified as connected components and recolored with distinct labels from 1 to 4, while cells with values 0-4 remain unchanged. The goal is to match specific expected color assignments for each component, likely following rules for 4-way connectivity and a particular order of discovery or assignment that cycles through colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right), treating cells >4 as fillable and cells <=4 (including 0) as barriers or empty space that cannot be crossed.
 * Coloring uses a cycle of 1-4, but the exact order (e.g., starting with 4 descending to 1, or ascending 1-4) and discovery order (row-major traversal) must match expected to avoid mismatches in later components; subtle element: the cycle wraps around (mod 4), but if the starting sequence is wrong, it cascades errors to subsequent blobs.
 * Components must be fully replaced with a single color per blob, but only if they are >4 initially; do not color or alter <=4 cells.
 * Order of processing cells (row by row, left to right) determines discovery order, which affects color assignment—early blobs get first colors, but if cycle is inverted or offset, mid-to-late blobs mismatch (e.g., a blob expected as 1 gets 2).
 * Subtle: Blobs may be separated by 0s or low numbers, and flood fill must not leak across them; also, isolated >4 cells count as single-cell components needing their own color.
 * No 8-way connectivity—sticking to 4-way prevents over-merging diagonal touches.
 * All components get colors from 1-4, cycling as needed, but expected outputs suggest a specific sequence like 4,3,1,2 for first few, then continuing differently, implying the cycle might not be simple descending or the discovery order needs sorting by position/size.
 * Empty or all-0 rows/areas stay 0; full rows of 1s in expected (e.g., row 5 in train1) suggest pre-colored or special cases, but program shouldn't alter them since <=4.
 * Potential miss: If input has varying >4 values (e.g., 5,6,...), they all get unified to one color per component, ignoring original value beyond the >4 threshold.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implemented 4-way BFS flood fill to identify and unify connected >4 cells into single colors, which worked for the top blobs in train1 (e.g., rows 1-3 matched expected 4,3,1,2 assignments) and some isolated areas, showing good handling of barriers and component isolation.
 * Color cycle [4,3,2,1] with row-major discovery partially worked for initial blobs but failed to match expected cycle—e.g., in train1, third blob (1's in row1) was assigned 1 in generated but code logic suggests it should be 2, indicating possible execution mismatch or cycle bug; this led to cascade errors.
 * In train1, lower blobs mismatched: row11 right blob colored 2 in generated vs. expected 1; row12 had 1 and 2 vs. expected 4 and 1; row13 had 1's where expected 4's; row14-16 showed fragmented 1's and 4's vs. more unified 4's and 1's in expected—likely due to wrong cycle offset causing later colors to shift (e.g., a component expected as 4 got 1).
 * In train2, top blobs partially matched (2,3,1 for first three), but mid-grid mismatches like row11-12 had incorrect 3's and 1's placements vs. expected 2's and 3's; lower areas (e.g., row20-22) had scattered 3's vs. unified patterns, and row23-24 introduced unwanted 2's where expected 3's—suggesting over-connecting or cycle misalignment.
 * Visited matrix and deque BFS were effective and not broken, avoiding infinite loops or partial fills.
 * No extraction of object properties (e.g., size, position) was used, which might be needed if colors depend on blob attributes rather than pure discovery order—current attempt assumed simple cycling, missing this subtlety.
 * The program handled empty grids/rows correctly (returns unchanged), but didn't account for potential need to sort components (e.g., by top-left position or size) before assigning colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same issues from training failures: fragmented and mismatched color assignments, e.g., scattered 1's in columns 14-24 across rows 2-29 suggest over-splitting or wrong cycling, while large 3-blobs in rows 2-7 and 8-16 look unified but likely offset (e.g., early 3's might be expected as 4's based on train patterns).
 * It shows good flood fill for some areas (e.g., solid 4's in row10 cols17-20, 2's in row20 cols0-5), but others are incorrect, like row11 having mixed 3's and 4's where expected might unify differently, and row25-29 having dense 1's and 4's that appear over-colored compared to train expectations of sparser patterns.
 * Overall, colors cycle through 1-4 but in a way that doesn't align with train expecteds (e.g., heavy use of 1's for vertical strips in col24, which might need 2 or 3); without the test input grid, can't verify connectivity, but the output has too many small 1/2 fragments (e.g., row22 col9 isolated 1's), suggesting possible under-merging or cycle causing visual inconsistency—does not make sense as a correct solution since trainings failed similarly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid where cells with values greater than 4 represent uncolored regions or "blobs" that must be identified as connected components (using 4-way connectivity) and then recolored with specific values 1-4 according to some rule-based assignment, while preserving 0s as background and not altering pre-colored cells (1-4). The goal is not simple sequential coloring in discovery order but likely depends on properties like component position, size, shape characteristics (e.g., holes, enclosure), or spatial relationships to match a target pattern, as evidenced by consistent shape preservation but color mismatches in outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only include cells >4 initially; 0s are barriers, and pre-existing 1-4 cells are not part of components or altered.
 * Color assignment is not based on row-major discovery order (which leads to cycling through 4,3,1,2 and mismatches); instead, it appears to follow a specific mapping, possibly by component location (e.g., top-to-bottom or left-to-right priority), size (larger first), or topological features like enclosure/holes (e.g., some components get 4 if they form "frames" or outer shapes).
 * Subtlety: Some components span multiple areas but are split correctly in expected outputs, suggesting no diagonal connectivity (8-way would merge unintended blobs); ensure flood fill strictly uses 4 directions.
 * Expected outputs reuse colors non-sequentially (e.g., multiple 1s, 2s), but adjacent components never share colors if they touch, hinting at a graph-coloring-like constraint with a fixed palette, though not enforced by adjacency alone (since simple cycling fails).
 * Grids have irregular shapes with empty rows/columns (all 0s), and components may be isolated or nested; preserve exact boundaries—any over/under-filling breaks shapes.
 * Potential miss: Components with "holes" (enclosed 0s) might get specific colors (e.g., 4 for outer frames in training 1 lower section); count internal 0s or perimeter to classify.
 * Order of processing matters: Scanning top-to-bottom left-to-right finds components in wrong sequence for color assignment; perhaps sort components by min-row, min-col, or area descending before coloring.
 * Edge case: Empty grid or no components >4 should return unchanged; single-cell components need correct color based on rule.
 * Visual puzzle aspect: Outputs resemble "paint-by-numbers" or region-coloring where colors form letters/shapes (e.g., training 1 upper has patterned 4-3-1-2 like a banner); test for semantic meaning like "flags" or "symbols" per region.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and fills connected components (shapes match expected in both training examples, e.g., upper banner-like blobs in training 1 rows 1-3 and full row 5 all 1s), confirming 4-way flood fill works without over-merging or boundary errors.
 * Failed on color assignment: Uses rigid cycle [4,3,1,2] in discovery order, leading to mismatches like in training 1 row 13 (generated 2,2 vs expected 4,4 for a vertical-ish blob) and row 15 (generated 2 vs expected 4 for extended horizontal); similar in row 14 (2 vs 4).
 * In training 1, lower sections (rows 8-16) show generated assigning 2/4 incorrectly to what seem like frame-like or enclosed components, while expected uses 4 for outers and 1/2 for inners—suggests rule favors 4 for "boundary" or larger/perimeter-heavy blobs.
 * Training 2 mismatches include row 1 (generated 4,4 in right but expected 2,2), row 3 (generated 4 vs expected 2 for extension), and row 14 (generated 4 vs expected 2 for small blob), indicating discovery order hits smaller/top components first but expected prioritizes by position or type (e.g., 2 for clustered extensions).
 * No extraction of component properties (e.g., size, holes) in attempt, which is essential for rule discovery; simple scanning misses reordering needs.
 * Cycle [4,3,1,2] starts correctly for top blobs but breaks lower (unknown why expected reuses 4 for non-adjacent but positionally similar shapes); adjacency not the issue as non-adjacent get same color.
 * deepcopy and visited matrix are correct/necessary to avoid mutating input.
 * No unhelpful functions in attempt—all are relevant, but select_color is broken for puzzle (too simplistic; replace with property-based mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves component shapes correctly (e.g., large 3-blob in rows 2-6 left, scattered 1s in right columns, 2/4 clusters bottom), but colors appear arbitrary/inconsistent with training patterns—e.g., top 4s in row 0-1 seem like small frames but get 4 (matches training outer rule?), yet mid 2s in rows 3-6 look like expected 3/4 in similar positions but are 2, suggesting same discovery-order flaw.
 * Does not look fully correct: Right-side 1s (rows 0-29 col 24+) form vertical lines but include isolated 1s where expected might merge or recolor based on enclosure (e.g., row 2 col 26-29 has 1,0,1,0 pattern, possibly should be uniform if connected via rule); bottom 2s (rows 23-29) overextend with 2 where training suggests 4 for horizontals.
 * Missing rule handling: Test has nested/complex blobs (e.g., row 11-15 4s with internal 0s), but generated cycles to 4/2 without checking holes/perimeter, likely mismatching expected (e.g., inner 0s in col 13-19 should influence color to 1 like training inners).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for shapes but not colors—looks like sequential assignment gone wrong, e.g., early 3 for large top blob (good) but later 4/2 swaps ignore positional priority seen in training.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-09-30 17:30:14] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
import collections
from copy import deepcopy
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    g = deepcopy(g)
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return g
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    cycle = [4, 3, 1, 2]
    component_index = 0
    dirs = [(dx, dy) for dx in [-1, 0, 1] for dy in [-1, 0, 1] if (dx, dy) != (0, 0)]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(w):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                col = cycle[component_index % 4]
                q = collections.deque([(r, c)])
                visited[r][c] = True
                g[r][c] = col
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] > 4 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            g[nx][ny] = col
                            q.append((nx, ny))

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...

[2025-09-30 17:30:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image segmentation or coloring, where cells with values greater than 4 represent uncolored "blobs" or components that must be identified via connected component labeling and assigned one of four colors (1, 2, 3, 4) in a specific cycling order based on discovery sequence, while preserving all other cell values (e.g., 0s and pre-colored cells like isolated 1s or patterns). The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected patterns, likely simulating a flood-fill coloring of shapes in a larger scene, such as distinguishing objects or regions in a diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined only for cells >4; all other cells (0-4) must remain unchanged, including pre-existing colored cells (e.g., solid lines of 1s or patterned areas like checkerboards of 2s).
 * Connectivity appears to be 4-directional (up, down, left, right) rather than 8-directional, as diagonal connections in the code lead to over-merging of components (e.g., separate blobs get joined incorrectly, shifting colors downstream).
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 1, 2] (or possibly a different order like [1,2,3,4], but evidence points to this sequence) for each new component discovered in row-major order (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
 * Discovery order matters critically: components are found by iterating rows and columns sequentially, starting BFS/DFS from the first unvisited >4 cell encountered, which affects color cycling (e.g., early components get 4, later ones cycle back).
 * Preserve exact shapes and sparsity: generated outputs often fill or connect areas that should remain separate or zeroed (e.g., isolated >4 cells might incorrectly merge with diagonals, or colors propagate into non-blob areas).
 * Grids have varying widths/heights but consistent 30-column outputs in examples; handle empty grids gracefully (return as-is).
 * Subtle patterns in expectations: some "components" form shapes like letters, bars, or enclosures (e.g., hollow vs. solid regions); over-filling breaks this (e.g., expected has gaps in 3s or 4s that generated fills solidly).
 * No modification to non >4 cells during flood-fill; visited array prevents re-coloring.
 * Potential for multiple components per "object" if not fully connected, but expectations show unified colors per visual blob, suggesting 4-connectivity to avoid diagonal leaks.
 * Cycle repeats every 4 components: e.g., 5th gets 4 again; index modulo 4 ensures this.
 * Easy to miss: pre-colored areas (e.g., full rows of 1s) act as barriers, not part of >4 components; also, some >4 might be noise or single cells that get isolated colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core flood-fill with BFS and visited matrix worked well for basic component detection and color assignment in simple, orthogonally connected areas (e.g., top sections of train 1 match expected for the 4,3,1,2 blobs).
 * Cycle [4,3,1,2] is correct, as early components in train 1 align (first blob 4, second 3, etc.), but later shifts occur due to merged components.
 * Row-major discovery order is correct, matching how expectations color sequential blobs.
 * deepcopy and boundary checks (0 <= nx < h) worked without errors; no off-grid issues.
 * 8-directional dirs over-merged components (e.g., in train 1 row 12, a 2 appears where expected 4 due to diagonal connection pulling in extra cells, shifting cycle); this broke separation of distinct shapes like enclosures or spaced blobs.
 * In train 1, generated mismatches in rows 12-16: e.g., row 12 has 2s at positions 12-13 where expected 4s (over-merge caused color skip); row 13 has scattered 2s/1s vs. solid 4s and 1s; row 15 has 2s where expected 4s (unknown if due to partial merge or visit skip, but clearly different shapes).
 * Train 1 row 16: generated has 0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,... vs. expected 0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,... (wrong color 4 vs. 3, and filled 1s mismatch pattern).
 * Train 2 mismatches broadly: e.g., row 1 has 4s where expected 2s (cycle shift from early merge); rows 14-16 have 4s/0s mixed incorrectly vs. expected 2s in blobs; row 23 has 1s where expected 3s (color propagation error).
 * extract_objects not used in the provided program but would be essential for debugging component counts (e.g., train 1 should have ~5-6 components to match cycle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; the BFS is solid but needs 4-connectivity fix. Avoid 8-dirs entirely, as it's broken for this puzzle (causes invalid merges).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows fragmented and incorrectly colored regions that don't align with coherent blob shapes seen in training expectations (e.g., row 2 has scattered 1s in what should likely be a unified pattern; row 10 has isolated 4s clumping oddly with 3s).
 * Over-merging evident: e.g., rows 3-6 show 3s and 2s bleeding diagonally into separate areas (like position (3,19)=2 connecting to (4,18)=2 via diagonal, but expectations would separate them as distinct components).
 * Color cycling seems off: early 4s in row 0-1 match possible first blob, but mid-grid 2s/1s appear too early (e.g., row 8 starts with 2s where a later color like 1 or 4 expected based on train patterns); lower rows 20+ have repeating 4s/2s that fragment expected solid shapes (e.g., row 22 has isolated 2s vs. likely connected bars).
 * Missing unity in shapes: test has broken lines (e.g., row 12 4s interrupted by 0s where a solid 4 or 3 blob should be); this doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expectations show clean, enclosed or linear colored regions without such speckling.
 * To handle test, switch to 4-connectivity and verify component order with extract_objects; account for more complex interleaving of pre-colored 1s/2s as barriers.

[2025-09-30 17:30:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving flood-filling connected components of uncolored cells (values >4) with colors 1-4 in a cycling order based on discovery sequence during a row-major scan, while preserving pre-existing cells (<=4, including 0 and pre-colored 1-4). The goal is to correctly identify and color 4-way (or possibly 8-way) connected blobs of >4 cells, but only applying colors to sufficiently large components or following subtle connectivity and ordering rules to match expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are discovered in strict row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), starting flood fill only on unvisited cells with value >4; small components (size <=4?) may need to be skipped or handled differently, as the current code colors everything, leading to index offsets in color cycling.
 * Color cycle is [4, 3, 1, 2] based on 0-based component discovery index (e.g., index 0=4, 1=3, 2=1, 3=2, 4=4), which matches early components but fails later, suggesting possible merges, skips, or different connectivity (e.g., 8-way instead of 4-way, causing fewer components and shifted indices).
 * Preserve all cells <=4 unchanged (0 as empty, 1-4 as pre-colored); only modify >4 cells during flood fill, and ensure flood fill spreads only to adjacent >4 cells (currently 4-way: up/down/left/right, but diagonals might connect components in expected outputs).
 * Potential subtlety: Only color components with size >4 cells; current code lacks size check, coloring all (even tiny ones), which may increment the component index prematurely and shift later colors (e.g., a small blob colored as index 3=2 instead of skipping it).
 * No alteration to grid structure; output must be same dimensions, with all >4 replaced by 1-4 per rules, and no >4 remaining in output (expected outputs show all <=4).
 * Discovery must mark visited correctly to avoid re-coloring; current visited is per cell, which is good, but if small components are skipped, visited might still need updating without coloring.
 * Subtle: Pre-colored cells (1-4) might block connectivity, and 0s are empty (non-blocking but not fillable); ensure flood fill doesn't cross <=4.
 * Overall, early/top components match expected, but mid-to-lower grid mismatches suggest ordering issues from unmerged or extra components.

    """Potential update: Scan row-major, but only color if component size >4; mark visited either way to skip small ones in index."""
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return g
    w = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    component_index = 0
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(w):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                size = compute_component_size(g, r, c, visited)  # Temp compute size
                # Reset visited for small? No, keep visited to skip, but don't color
                if size > 4:
                    col = select_color(component_index)
                    flood_fill_component(g, r, c, col, visited)  # But this would re-visit; need separate pass or restore
                    component_index += 1
                # For small, leave as >4 but since expected has no >4, this may not work; perhaps color small differently or error
    return g
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt uses 4-way flood fill on all >4 components in row-major order with cycle [4,3,1,2], which correctly colors early/top components (e.g., train 1 rows 1-3 match expected with 4/3/1/2 blobs) but fails on later/mid-grid components due to color shifts (e.g., train 1 row 12: generated 2,2 at cols 12-13 vs expected 4,4; row 13: generated 2,2,2 vs 4,4,4; row 16: generated 4 vs expected 3 at col 5).
 * Train 1 mismatches propagate: a presumed extra small component colored early increments index, causing later blobs (e.g., the 4-blob in rows 12-15) to get index 3 (color 2) instead of index 4 (color 4); similar in row 20-21 where generated has 3's but expected has 2's in some spots (unknown exact cause, possibly unmerged components).
 * Train 2 mismatches similarly: early matches (rows 1-3: 2/3/1 patterns), but later shifts (e.g., row 4 generated has 4's in large blob cols 13-25 vs expected 2's; row 14 generated 4's vs expected 2's; row 20 generated 4's in cols 11-14 vs expected 2's), suggesting same index offset from extra colored components or wrong connectivity (4-way misses diagonal merges, creating more components than expected).
 * preserve_cells_le_4 is redundant/unhelpful (implicitly handled by targeting only >4; remove to simplify).
 * flood_fill_component is mostly helpful but broken without size check or 8-way option; it colors all components, leading to extra index increments for small blobs.
 * select_color is correct for cycle but unhelpful if discovery order is off due to connectivity or skips.
 * deepcopy in program is helpful for non-mutating input.
 * No extraction functions used; consider adding component_size to identify large-only coloring, as small components may need skipping (but expected has no >4 left, so unclear—possibly color small with different rule or all are large in examples).
 * Overall attempt shows understanding of scan order and cycle but misses subtlety of component size threshold (>4 cells?) or 8-way connectivity, causing cumulative index errors.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed logic as the incorrect training examples (colors all >4 components with 4-way fill and cycle [4,3,1,2]), likely suffering from index shifts on later components (e.g., large blob in rows 2-6 colored 3's correctly early, but row 9-16 has mixed 2/3/4's that may shift if small components were skipped or merged in expected; row 17-29 has 1/2/4 patterns that appear over-colored without size check).
 * Specific issues: Assumed early components (e.g., row 1-2 3's and 4's) might match if input similar, but mid-grid (rows 8-16) shows fragmented 2/3/4 coloring around what looks like a large connected area (possibly should merge to fewer colors like 1 or 2 if 8-way); lower rows 18-29 have 1/2/4 but expected likely cycles cleanly without extras (e.g., row 23 generated 4's in cols 1-2 but may be part of larger 2-blob above).
 * Test output is overzealous in coloring (no size filter), and lacks diagonal connectivity consideration, leading to more components than expected; it "makes sense" under the attempt's rules but not the puzzle's, as trains failed similarly—does not account for potential large-component-only rule or 8-way to reduce component count and fix cycle.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where cells with values greater than 4 represent parts of "objects" or blobs that need to be identified as connected components and recolored with distinct labels from 1 to 4, while cells with values 0-4 remain unchanged. The goal is to match specific expected color assignments for each component, likely following rules for 4-way connectivity and a particular order of discovery or assignment that cycles through colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right), treating cells >4 as fillable and cells <=4 (including 0) as barriers or empty space that cannot be crossed.
 * Coloring uses a cycle of 1-4, but the exact order (e.g., starting with 4 descending to 1, or ascending 1-4) and discovery order (row-major traversal) must match expected to avoid mismatches in later components; subtle element: the cycle wraps around (mod 4), but if the starting sequence is wrong, it cascades errors to subsequent blobs.
 * Components must be fully replaced with a single color per blob, but only if they are >4 initially; do not color or alter <=4 cells.
 * Order of processing cells (row by row, left to right) determines discovery order, which affects color assignment—early blobs get first colors, but if cycle is inverted or offset, mid-to-late blobs mismatch (e.g., a blob expected as 1 gets 2).
 * Subtle: Blobs may be separated by 0s or low numbers, and flood fill must not leak across them; also, isolated >4 cells count as single-cell components needing their own color.
 * No 8-way connectivity—sticking to 4-way prevents over-merging diagonal touches.
 * All components get colors from 1-4, cycling as needed, but expected outputs suggest a specific sequence like 4,3,1,2 for first few, then continuing differently, implying the cycle might not be simple descending or the discovery order needs sorting by position/size.
 * Empty or all-0 rows/areas stay 0; full rows of 1s in expected (e.g., row 5 in train1) suggest pre-colored or special cases, but program shouldn't alter them since <=4.
 * Potential miss: If input has varying >4 values (e.g., 5,6,...), they all get unified to one color per component, ignoring original value beyond the >4 threshold.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly implemented 4-way BFS flood fill to identify and unify connected >4 cells into single colors, which worked for the top blobs in train1 (e.g., rows 1-3 matched expected 4,3,1,2 assignments) and some isolated areas, showing good handling of barriers and component isolation.
 * Color cycle [4,3,2,1] with row-major discovery partially worked for initial blobs but failed to match expected cycle—e.g., in train1, third blob (1's in row1) was assigned 1 in generated but code logic suggests it should be 2, indicating possible execution mismatch or cycle bug; this led to cascade errors.
 * In train1, lower blobs mismatched: row11 right blob colored 2 in generated vs. expected 1; row12 had 1 and 2 vs. expected 4 and 1; row13 had 1's where expected 4's; row14-16 showed fragmented 1's and 4's vs. more unified 4's and 1's in expected—likely due to wrong cycle offset causing later colors to shift (e.g., a component expected as 4 got 1).
 * In train2, top blobs partially matched (2,3,1 for first three), but mid-grid mismatches like row11-12 had incorrect 3's and 1's placements vs. expected 2's and 3's; lower areas (e.g., row20-22) had scattered 3's vs. unified patterns, and row23-24 introduced unwanted 2's where expected 3's—suggesting over-connecting or cycle misalignment.
 * Visited matrix and deque BFS were effective and not broken, avoiding infinite loops or partial fills.
 * No extraction of object properties (e.g., size, position) was used, which might be needed if colors depend on blob attributes rather than pure discovery order—current attempt assumed simple cycling, missing this subtlety.
 * The program handled empty grids/rows correctly (returns unchanged), but didn't account for potential need to sort components (e.g., by top-left position or size) before assigning colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same issues from training failures: fragmented and mismatched color assignments, e.g., scattered 1's in columns 14-24 across rows 2-29 suggest over-splitting or wrong cycling, while large 3-blobs in rows 2-7 and 8-16 look unified but likely offset (e.g., early 3's might be expected as 4's based on train patterns).
 * It shows good flood fill for some areas (e.g., solid 4's in row10 cols17-20, 2's in row20 cols0-5), but others are incorrect, like row11 having mixed 3's and 4's where expected might unify differently, and row25-29 having dense 1's and 4's that appear over-colored compared to train expectations of sparser patterns.
 * Overall, colors cycle through 1-4 but in a way that doesn't align with train expecteds (e.g., heavy use of 1's for vertical strips in col24, which might need 2 or 3); without the test input grid, can't verify connectivity, but the output has too many small 1/2 fragments (e.g., row22 col9 isolated 1's), suggesting possible under-merging or cycle causing visual inconsistency—does not make sense as a correct solution since trainings failed similarly.

**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid where cells with values greater than 4 represent uncolored regions or "blobs" that must be identified as connected components (using 4-way connectivity) and then recolored with specific values 1-4 according to some rule-based assignment, while preserving 0s as background and not altering pre-colored cells (1-4). The goal is not simple sequential coloring in discovery order but likely depends on properties like component position, size, shape characteristics (e.g., holes, enclosure), or spatial relationships to match a target pattern, as evidenced by consistent shape preservation but color mismatches in outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only include cells >4 initially; 0s are barriers, and pre-existing 1-4 cells are not part of components or altered.
 * Color assignment is not based on row-major discovery order (which leads to cycling through 4,3,1,2 and mismatches); instead, it appears to follow a specific mapping, possibly by component location (e.g., top-to-bottom or left-to-right priority), size (larger first), or topological features like enclosure/holes (e.g., some components get 4 if they form "frames" or outer shapes).
 * Subtlety: Some components span multiple areas but are split correctly in expected outputs, suggesting no diagonal connectivity (8-way would merge unintended blobs); ensure flood fill strictly uses 4 directions.
 * Expected outputs reuse colors non-sequentially (e.g., multiple 1s, 2s), but adjacent components never share colors if they touch, hinting at a graph-coloring-like constraint with a fixed palette, though not enforced by adjacency alone (since simple cycling fails).
 * Grids have irregular shapes with empty rows/columns (all 0s), and components may be isolated or nested; preserve exact boundaries—any over/under-filling breaks shapes.
 * Potential miss: Components with "holes" (enclosed 0s) might get specific colors (e.g., 4 for outer frames in training 1 lower section); count internal 0s or perimeter to classify.
 * Order of processing matters: Scanning top-to-bottom left-to-right finds components in wrong sequence for color assignment; perhaps sort components by min-row, min-col, or area descending before coloring.
 * Edge case: Empty grid or no components >4 should return unchanged; single-cell components need correct color based on rule.
 * Visual puzzle aspect: Outputs resemble "paint-by-numbers" or region-coloring where colors form letters/shapes (e.g., training 1 upper has patterned 4-3-1-2 like a banner); test for semantic meaning like "flags" or "symbols" per region.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and fills connected components (shapes match expected in both training examples, e.g., upper banner-like blobs in training 1 rows 1-3 and full row 5 all 1s), confirming 4-way flood fill works without over-merging or boundary errors.
 * Failed on color assignment: Uses rigid cycle [4,3,1,2] in discovery order, leading to mismatches like in training 1 row 13 (generated 2,2 vs expected 4,4 for a vertical-ish blob) and row 15 (generated 2 vs expected 4 for extended horizontal); similar in row 14 (2 vs 4).
 * In training 1, lower sections (rows 8-16) show generated assigning 2/4 incorrectly to what seem like frame-like or enclosed components, while expected uses 4 for outers and 1/2 for inners—suggests rule favors 4 for "boundary" or larger/perimeter-heavy blobs.
 * Training 2 mismatches include row 1 (generated 4,4 in right but expected 2,2), row 3 (generated 4 vs expected 2 for extension), and row 14 (generated 4 vs expected 2 for small blob), indicating discovery order hits smaller/top components first but expected prioritizes by position or type (e.g., 2 for clustered extensions).
 * No extraction of component properties (e.g., size, holes) in attempt, which is essential for rule discovery; simple scanning misses reordering needs.
 * Cycle [4,3,1,2] starts correctly for top blobs but breaks lower (unknown why expected reuses 4 for non-adjacent but positionally similar shapes); adjacency not the issue as non-adjacent get same color.
 * deepcopy and visited matrix are correct/necessary to avoid mutating input.
 * No unhelpful functions in attempt—all are relevant, but select_color is broken for puzzle (too simplistic; replace with property-based mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves component shapes correctly (e.g., large 3-blob in rows 2-6 left, scattered 1s in right columns, 2/4 clusters bottom), but colors appear arbitrary/inconsistent with training patterns—e.g., top 4s in row 0-1 seem like small frames but get 4 (matches training outer rule?), yet mid 2s in rows 3-6 look like expected 3/4 in similar positions but are 2, suggesting same discovery-order flaw.
 * Does not look fully correct: Right-side 1s (rows 0-29 col 24+) form vertical lines but include isolated 1s where expected might merge or recolor based on enclosure (e.g., row 2 col 26-29 has 1,0,1,0 pattern, possibly should be uniform if connected via rule); bottom 2s (rows 23-29) overextend with 2 where training suggests 4 for horizontals.
 * Missing rule handling: Test has nested/complex blobs (e.g., row 11-15 4s with internal 0s), but generated cycles to 4/2 without checking holes/perimeter, likely mismatching expected (e.g., inner 0s in col 13-19 should influence color to 1 like training inners).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for shapes but not colors—looks like sequential assignment gone wrong, e.g., early 3 for large top blob (good) but later 4/2 swaps ignore positional priority seen in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image segmentation or coloring, where cells with values greater than 4 represent uncolored "blobs" or components that must be identified via connected component labeling and assigned one of four colors (1, 2, 3, 4) in a specific cycling order based on discovery sequence, while preserving all other cell values (e.g., 0s and pre-colored cells like isolated 1s or patterns). The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected patterns, likely simulating a flood-fill coloring of shapes in a larger scene, such as distinguishing objects or regions in a diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined only for cells >4; all other cells (0-4) must remain unchanged, including pre-existing colored cells (e.g., solid lines of 1s or patterned areas like checkerboards of 2s).
 * Connectivity appears to be 4-directional (up, down, left, right) rather than 8-directional, as diagonal connections in the code lead to over-merging of components (e.g., separate blobs get joined incorrectly, shifting colors downstream).
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 1, 2] (or possibly a different order like [1,2,3,4], but evidence points to this sequence) for each new component discovered in row-major order (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
 * Discovery order matters critically: components are found by iterating rows and columns sequentially, starting BFS/DFS from the first unvisited >4 cell encountered, which affects color cycling (e.g., early components get 4, later ones cycle back).
 * Preserve exact shapes and sparsity: generated outputs often fill or connect areas that should remain separate or zeroed (e.g., isolated >4 cells might incorrectly merge with diagonals, or colors propagate into non-blob areas).
 * Grids have varying widths/heights but consistent 30-column outputs in examples; handle empty grids gracefully (return as-is).
 * Subtle patterns in expectations: some "components" form shapes like letters, bars, or enclosures (e.g., hollow vs. solid regions); over-filling breaks this (e.g., expected has gaps in 3s or 4s that generated fills solidly).
 * No modification to non >4 cells during flood-fill; visited array prevents re-coloring.
 * Potential for multiple components per "object" if not fully connected, but expectations show unified colors per visual blob, suggesting 4-connectivity to avoid diagonal leaks.
 * Cycle repeats every 4 components: e.g., 5th gets 4 again; index modulo 4 ensures this.
 * Easy to miss: pre-colored areas (e.g., full rows of 1s) act as barriers, not part of >4 components; also, some >4 might be noise or single cells that get isolated colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core flood-fill with BFS and visited matrix worked well for basic component detection and color assignment in simple, orthogonally connected areas (e.g., top sections of train 1 match expected for the 4,3,1,2 blobs).
 * Cycle [4,3,1,2] is correct, as early components in train 1 align (first blob 4, second 3, etc.), but later shifts occur due to merged components.
 * Row-major discovery order is correct, matching how expectations color sequential blobs.
 * deepcopy and boundary checks (0 <= nx < h) worked without errors; no off-grid issues.
 * 8-directional dirs over-merged components (e.g., in train 1 row 12, a 2 appears where expected 4 due to diagonal connection pulling in extra cells, shifting cycle); this broke separation of distinct shapes like enclosures or spaced blobs.
 * In train 1, generated mismatches in rows 12-16: e.g., row 12 has 2s at positions 12-13 where expected 4s (over-merge caused color skip); row 13 has scattered 2s/1s vs. solid 4s and 1s; row 15 has 2s where expected 4s (unknown if due to partial merge or visit skip, but clearly different shapes).
 * Train 1 row 16: generated has 0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,... vs. expected 0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,... (wrong color 4 vs. 3, and filled 1s mismatch pattern).
 * Train 2 mismatches broadly: e.g., row 1 has 4s where expected 2s (cycle shift from early merge); rows 14-16 have 4s/0s mixed incorrectly vs. expected 2s in blobs; row 23 has 1s where expected 3s (color propagation error).
 * extract_objects not used in the provided program but would be essential for debugging component counts (e.g., train 1 should have ~5-6 components to match cycle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; the BFS is solid but needs 4-connectivity fix. Avoid 8-dirs entirely, as it's broken for this puzzle (causes invalid merges).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows fragmented and incorrectly colored regions that don't align with coherent blob shapes seen in training expectations (e.g., row 2 has scattered 1s in what should likely be a unified pattern; row 10 has isolated 4s clumping oddly with 3s).
 * Over-merging evident: e.g., rows 3-6 show 3s and 2s bleeding diagonally into separate areas (like position (3,19)=2 connecting to (4,18)=2 via diagonal, but expectations would separate them as distinct components).
 * Color cycling seems off: early 4s in row 0-1 match possible first blob, but mid-grid 2s/1s appear too early (e.g., row 8 starts with 2s where a later color like 1 or 4 expected based on train patterns); lower rows 20+ have repeating 4s/2s that fragment expected solid shapes (e.g., row 22 has isolated 2s vs. likely connected bars).
 * Missing unity in shapes: test has broken lines (e.g., row 12 4s interrupted by 0s where a solid 4 or 3 blob should be); this doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expectations show clean, enclosed or linear colored regions without such speckling.
 * To handle test, switch to 4-connectivity and verify component order with extract_objects; account for more complex interleaving of pre-colored 1s/2s as barriers.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 17:36:50] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based coloring puzzle where uncolored regions (cells with values >4) represent connected components that must be flooded with colors from a repeating cycle [4, 3, 1, 2], discovered in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), using 4-way orthogonal connectivity, while strictly preserving all pre-existing colors (1-4) and empty cells (0) as barriers that block flooding. The goal is to color each distinct uncolored component with the next color in the cycle based on the order of discovery, ensuring no over-coloring or merging across barriers.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Uncolored cells (>4) form components only via 4-way (up, down, left, right) adjacency; diagonal connections do not count, which preserves separations in sparse or checkerboard-like patterns.
 * Discovery order is strictly row-major: scan rows from top to bottom, and within each row from left to right; the first uncolored cell encountered in this order starts a new component and gets the next cycle color (starting from index 0 of [4,3,1,2], repeating as needed).
 * All cells <=4 (including 0 and pre-colored 1-4) must remain unchanged and act as barriers; flooding never crosses or overwrites them, even if surrounded by >4 cells.
 * The cycle [4,3,1,2] is fixed and repeats (e.g., 5th component gets 4 again); color assignment is per-component, not per-cell, via flood fill from the discovery point.
 * Pre-colored regions (1-4) may already form "components" but are not recolored; the program must deep-copy the grid to avoid accidental mutation.
 * Subtlety: In training examples, some expected outputs show colors that suggest components might be split by 0s or pre-colors in ways the 4-way rule handles correctly, but discovery order can lead to more components than expected if barriers create isolated >4 pockets.
 * Easy to miss: Row-major discovery means vertical stacks or L-shapes may be discovered as separate components if a lower part is hit first due to scanning order—no backtracking.
 * Another subtlety: If a component spans multiple rows, it's colored entirely when its top-left-most cell is discovered; later cells in the same component are skipped.
 * Considerations from attempts: BFS flood fill is essential for efficient coloring, but queue management must ensure no revisiting; modulo for cycle ensures repetition without overflow.
 * Potential issue: If input has no >4 cells in some areas, output should match input exactly; all >4 must be replaced, leaving no >4 in final grid.
 * General: Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 30x30-ish from outputs), so code must handle arbitrary h/w; no diagonal or 8-way connectivity, as that would merge unintended regions (e.g., in train1's scattered patterns).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import collections
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def get_color_cycle() -> List[int]:
    """Returns the fixed cycle [4, 3, 1, 2] for assigning colors to components in discovery order."""
    return [4, 3, 1, 2]

def select_color(component_index: int) -> int:
    """Selects color from cycle using modulo for repetition."""
    cycle = get_color_cycle()
    return cycle[component_index % len(cycle)]

def get_4way_directions() -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    """Returns orthogonal directions for 4-way connectivity."""
    return [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

def flood_fill_uncolored(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int) -> None:
    """BFS flood fills connected >4 cells from start, mutating g; stops at <=4 barriers."""
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    queue = collections.deque([(start_r, start_c)])
    g[start_r][start_c] = color
    directions = get_4way_directions()
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and g[nx][ny] > 4:
                g[nx][ny] = color
                queue.append((nx, ny))
```
```python
def preserve_precolored_and_zeros(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Deep copies grid to ensure <=4 cells (0 and pre-colors) are never mutated."""
    return deepcopy(g)

def discover_components_row_major(g: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """Scans row-major to find first >4 cell per component, assigns cycle color, and floods."""
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    component_index = 0
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(w):
            if g[r][c] > 4:
                color = select_color(component_index)
                flood_fill_uncolored(g, r, c, color)
                component_index += 1
```
These functions form the core logic and worked partially for structure but failed on specific color assignments.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used the correct high-level structure (deep copy, row-major discovery, 4-way BFS flood fill, cycle [4,3,1,2], barriers at <=4), which preserved pre-colors and 0s correctly in most places and colored all >4 cells.
 * What worked: Correctly identified and filled many components without overwriting barriers; cycle repetition via modulo was implemented right; BFS avoided infinite loops.
 * What didn't work: In train1, mismatched colors in lower sections—e.g., row 12 (0-based) has generated [0,0,3,3,0,3,3,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] (generated used 3 where expected has 0/4, suggesting wrong component merging or discovery skipping a barrier-separated group); row 13 generated [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] (2 instead of 4, likely cycle index off due to overcounting components earlier); row 16 generated [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (4 instead of 3, wrong cycle hit); bottom rows (e.g., 26-29) have generated 4s in places expected has 2s (e.g., row 27 generated [0,0,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], showing extra 2s and misplaced 4s, possibly from treating separated >4 as one component).
 * In train2, similar issues: Top sections mostly match but row 1 generated [0,2,2,2,0,3,3,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,2,2,2,0,3,3,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (4 instead of 2 for a component); row 17 generated [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs. expected [0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (4s instead of 2s, indicating cycle advanced too far or wrong discovery order); lower rows show 3s where expected has isolated patterns, suggesting barrier misrecognition (unknown why, but 0s not blocking properly).
 * Overall, attempt over-merged some components (e.g., via incorrect barrier detection) or miscounted discovery index, leading to cycle shifts; no evidence of 8-way being needed, as 4-way fits most matches.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (deepcopy, BFS, row-major scan) are relevant but buggy in integration (e.g., flood_fill assumes >4 but may propagate if pre-colors are misread).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from training (e.g., inconsistent cycle applications and potential over-merging); for instance, early rows show 3s and 4s in clustered >4 areas that might be separate components under row-major (e.g., row 2 has [0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,4,4,4,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0], but without input, hard to verify—expected likely has different cycle starts like 4 then 1, based on train patterns).
 * It preserves pre-colors (e.g., 1s in right columns match expected isolation) but miscolors left clusters (e.g., row 8 [2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0] uses 2/3 where train suggests cycling from 4/3/1); bottom rows have scattered 2s and 4s that seem merged incorrectly (e.g., row 24 [0,4,4,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,4,4,4,0] likely should have uniform components per discovery).
 * Test output makes partial sense for structure (all cells <=4 or 1-4, no >4 left) but not for colors—differences like extra 2s in mid-left (vs. expected 1/3 cycles) suggest discovery order or connectivity bug; to fix, verify input barriers and simulate row-major manually for test.
