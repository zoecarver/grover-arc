=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 18:27:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.


[2025-09-30 18:40:17] Response:
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(len(h)):
        for c in range(len(h[r])):
            if h[r][c] > 4:
                h[r][c] = 0
    return h

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(len(h)):
        for c in range(len(h[r])):
            if h[r][c] > 4:
                h[r][c] = 0
    return h
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

[2025-09-30 18:41:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input.

If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 18:55:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 18:55:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 19:08:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful for safe grid manipulation.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Perform flood fill to find connected component of cells >4 using 4-connectivity."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    blob = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.popleft()
        if visited[r][c]:
            continue
        visited[r][c] = True
        if g[r][c] <= 4:
            continue
        blob.append((r, c))
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] > 4:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return blob
```
(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

[2025-09-30 19:08:33] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Interactions

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs (the only examples with visible transformations), the following are the **only** obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed **across every train example** (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties/components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in the same way in both cases. I focused solely on elements with direct, repeatable effects (e.g., on color or presence in output). No high-level puzzle solving or assumptions about test inputs (which lack outputs) were made. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., background color, implicit grid structure, pixel counts or bounding boxes that do not change or influence anything) are excluded. Non-consistent elements (e.g., specific vertical strip details, which vary in bounding boxes and do not show uniform effects) are noted as unknown where relevant. Only interactions present in **both** train examples are included.

#### 1. **Hole Count in Orange Shapes → Output Color (via Mapping from Pre-Colored Key Shapes)**
   - **Components Involved**: Orange polyominoes (input only) and pre-colored key shapes (small, left-positioned clusters with sequential increasing hole counts, e.g., starting at low x-coordinates like [1,1,...]).
   - **Interaction Description**: The number of holes (holes property) in an orange shape directly determines its output color by matching against a mapping defined by the colors of pre-colored key shapes. Each key shape has a unique hole count (starting from 0 and increasing sequentially, e.g., holes=0, then 1, etc.) and its own color serves as the mapping for that exact hole count. Orange shapes are recolored to match the key's color for their hole count. This is consistent in both trains:
     - Train 1: Keys map holes=0→Yellow, 1→Green, 2→Blue, 3→Red. Oranges with holes=0,1,2,3 are recolored accordingly (e.g., multiple holes=0 become Yellow).
     - Train 2: Keys map holes=0→Red, 1→Green. Oranges with holes=0 or 1 are recolored accordingly (e.g., multiple holes=0 become Red).
   - **Effect on Output**: Orange shape transforms to a colored polyomino (same shape/properties) in the mapped color. No other properties (e.g., bbox, pixels, holes) are affected.
   - **Consistency Note**: This mapping is always used for oranges; no other factors (e.g., position, size, or pixels) influence the color choice. Unknown: How the initial key colors are determined (possibly related to the vertical color strip, but strip details do not show consistent effects across trains).

#### 2. **Hole Count in Orange Shapes → Presence in Output (Omission if Unmapped)**
   - **Components Involved**: Orange polyominoes (input) and pre-colored key shapes (as mapping providers).
   - **Interaction Description**: If an orange shape's hole count does not match any key shape's hole count (i.e., exceeds the maximum mapped hole count from keys), the orange is omitted entirely from the output. This acts as a filter based on the hole count relative to the key set.
     - Train 1: Keys cover up to holes=3; the orange with holes=4 is omitted.
     - Train 2: Keys cover up to holes=1; the orange with holes=2 is omitted.
   - **Effect on Output**: No trace of the omitted orange (no shape, no color) appears; output only includes mapped oranges and unchanged non-oranges.
   - **Consistency Note**: Omission is strictly tied to hole count exceeding the key mapping range; no omissions occur for mapped hole counts, regardless of shape complexity or position.

#### 3. **Pre-Colored Non-Orange Shapes → Unchanged Presence and Properties in Output**
   - **Components Involved**: Pre-colored shapes (e.g., initial key shapes like small Yellow/Green/etc. clusters, and other non-oranges like the Blue horizontal/small rectangle).
   - **Interaction Description**: All non-orange shapes (including keys) remain completely unchanged—they do not interact with oranges or the mapping but serve as static references. Their color, holes, bbox, and pixels are preserved exactly.
     - Train 1: 5 non-oranges (4 keys + 1 Blue) stay identical.
     - Train 2: At least 3 non-oranges (2 keys + 1 Blue) stay identical.
   - **Effect on Output**: These shapes appear in output with no modifications, providing the stable mapping reference for orange transformations.
   - **Consistency Note**: This non-interaction (i.e., invariance) is consistent; no non-orange is ever recolored, omitted, or transformed, even if adjacent to oranges.

#### Excluded or Unknown Elements (No Consistent Interactions Observed)
- **Vertical Color Strip**: Present in input (right-side, stacked colored rectangles: blue tall, maroon with 'B', purple, pink dotted, yellow dotted). Absent in output. Possible interaction with color mapping (e.g., influencing key colors), but no consistent effect across trains—its bounding boxes and integration vary (e.g., Train 1 has horizontal Blue at y=5; Train 2 has small Blue at top-left), and it does not directly affect orange transformations in a uniform way. Called out as unknown.
- **Position (bbox) Effects**: Bounding boxes stay identical for transformed shapes, but no evidence of position influencing color, omission, or any other property consistently (e.g., no left/right/up/down transformations or position-based color shifts).
- **Pixel Count or Shape Silhouette**: Pixels and overall shape (e.g., edges, connectivity) remain unchanged, but do not affect or interact with color/mapping/omission consistently.
- **Colors Beyond Y/G/B/R in Trains**: Output colors are limited to the key-provided ones (e.g., no new colors introduced); test inputs have additional colors (e.g., Maroon, Pink), but no outputs to verify consistency.
- **Holes in Non-Oranges**: Holes in keys interact only with the mapping (as described); holes in other non-oranges (e.g., Blue h=0) have no observed effect on anything.
- **Background/Grid**: Uniform black background and implicit grid are static and do not interact with or affect any components consistently (no color bleed, movement, or transformation based on them).

No other connections (e.g., color-to-position, holes-to-movement, or silhouette-based effects) are obvious or consistent across both train examples. If additional train outputs were provided, more could be verified, but based on this, the above are the only reliable interactions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:11:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

```
(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Interactions

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs (the only examples with visible transformations), the following are the **only** obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed **across every train example** (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties/components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in the same way in both cases. I focused solely on elements with direct, repeatable effects (e.g., on color or presence in output). No high-level puzzle solving or assumptions about test inputs (which lack outputs) were made. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., background color, implicit grid structure, pixel counts or bounding boxes that do not change or influence anything) are excluded. Non-consistent elements (e.g., specific vertical strip details, which vary in bounding boxes and do not show uniform effects) are noted as unknown where relevant. Only interactions present in **both** train examples are included.

#### 1. **Hole Count in Orange Shapes → Output Color (via Mapping from Pre-Colored Key Shapes)**
   - **Components Involved**: Orange polyominoes (input only) and pre-colored key shapes (small, left-positioned clusters with sequential increasing hole counts, e.g., starting at low x-coordinates like [1,1,...]).
   - **Interaction Description**: The number of holes (holes property) in an orange shape directly determines its output color by matching against a mapping defined by the colors of pre-colored key shapes. Each key shape has a unique hole count (starting from 0 and increasing sequentially, e.g., holes=0, then 1, etc.) and its own color serves as the mapping for that exact hole count. Orange shapes are recolored to match the key's color for their hole count. This is consistent in both trains:
     - Train 1: Keys map holes=0→Yellow, 1→Green, 2→Blue, 3→Red. Oranges with holes=0,1,2,3 are recolored accordingly (e.g., multiple holes=0 become Yellow).
     - Train 2: Keys map holes=0→Red, 1→Green. Oranges with holes=0 or 1 are recolored accordingly (e.g., multiple holes=0 become Red).
   - **Effect on Output**: Orange shape transforms to a colored polyomino (same shape/properties) in the mapped color. No other properties (e.g., bbox, pixels, holes) are affected.
   - **Consistency Note**: This mapping is always used for oranges; no other factors (e.g., position, size, or pixels) influence the color choice. Unknown: How the initial key colors are determined (possibly related to the vertical color strip, but strip details do not show consistent effects across trains).

#### 2. **Hole Count in Orange Shapes → Presence in Output (Omission if Unmapped)**
   - **Components Involved**: Orange polyominoes (input) and pre-colored key shapes (as mapping providers).
   - **Interaction Description**: If an orange shape's hole count does not match any key shape's hole count (i.e., exceeds the maximum mapped hole count from keys), the orange is omitted entirely from the output. This acts as a filter based on the hole count relative to the key set.
     - Train 1: Keys cover up to holes=3; the orange with holes=4 is omitted.
     - Train 2: Keys cover up to holes=1; the orange with holes=2 is omitted.
   - **Effect on Output**: No trace of the omitted orange (no shape, no color) appears; output only includes mapped oranges and unchanged non-oranges.
   - **Consistency Note**: Omission is strictly tied to hole count exceeding the key mapping range; no omissions occur for mapped hole counts, regardless of shape complexity or position.

#### 3. **Pre-Colored Non-Orange Shapes → Unchanged Presence and Properties in Output**
   - **Components Involved**: Pre-colored shapes (e.g., initial key shapes like small Yellow/Green/etc. clusters, and other non-oranges like the Blue horizontal/small rectangle).
   - **Interaction Description**: All non-orange shapes (including keys) remain completely unchanged—they do not interact with oranges or the mapping but serve as static references. Their color, holes, bbox, and pixels are preserved exactly.
     - Train 1: 5 non-oranges (4 keys + 1 Blue) stay identical.
     - Train 2: At least 3 non-oranges (2 keys + 1 Blue) stay identical.
   - **Effect on Output**: These shapes appear in output with no modifications, providing the stable mapping reference for orange transformations.
   - **Consistency Note**: This non-interaction (i.e., invariance) is consistent; no non-orange is ever recolored, omitted, or transformed, even if adjacent to oranges.

#### Excluded or Unknown Elements (No Consistent Interactions Observed)
- **Vertical Color Strip**: Present in input (right-side, stacked colored rectangles: blue tall, maroon with 'B', purple, pink dotted, yellow dotted). Absent in output. Possible interaction with color mapping (e.g., influencing key colors), but no consistent effect across trains—its bounding boxes and integration vary (e.g., Train 1 has horizontal Blue at y=5; Train 2 has small Blue at top-left), and it does not directly affect orange transformations in a uniform way. Called out as unknown.
- **Position (bbox) Effects**: Bounding boxes stay identical for transformed shapes, but no evidence of position influencing color, omission, or any other property consistently (e.g., no left/right/up/down transformations or position-based color shifts).
- **Pixel Count or Shape Silhouette**: Pixels and overall shape (e.g., edges, connectivity) remain unchanged, but do not affect or interact with color/mapping/omission consistently.
- **Colors Beyond Y/G/B/R in Trains**: Output colors are limited to the key-provided ones (e.g., no new colors introduced); test inputs have additional colors (e.g., Maroon, Pink), but no outputs to verify consistency.
- **Holes in Non-Oranges**: Holes in keys interact only with the mapping (as described); holes in other non-oranges (e.g., Blue h=0) have no observed effect on anything.
- **Background/Grid**: Uniform black background and implicit grid are static and do not interact with or affect any components consistently (no color bleed, movement, or transformation based on them).

No other connections (e.g., color-to-position, holes-to-movement, or silhouette-based effects) are obvious or consistent across both train examples. If additional train outputs were provided, more could be verified, but based on this, the above are the only reliable interactions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components where small "key" shapes (colored 1-4, exactly 3 rows high) encode color mappings via the number of enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the border), and larger "orange" blobs (high values, potentially including 4) are recolored to match the key color associated with their own enclosed hole count, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be connected components of the same color (1-4) with exact height 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); taller or shorter components are ignored, even if they visually resemble keys (e.g., a full-height vertical line of 1's is one component of height 30, not multiple keys).
 * Holes are strictly internal 0's disconnected from the grid border; the count_holes function uses BFS from border non-barrier cells to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unmarked 0's inside the shape—subtlety: barriers are only the component cells themselves, so adjacent 0's outside the component but enclosed by it count as holes if not border-connected.
 * Multiple keys with the same hole count: select the "best" (smallest min_r, then smallest min_c) to map hole count to a single color; if no key for a blob's hole count, set blob to 0.
 * Blobs are connected components of high values (code assumes >4 for "orange"), but subtlety: in the test case, values are exactly 4, suggesting blobs may include ==4; unconnected or isolated high cells aren't blobs.
 * Grid is copied before modification to avoid altering input; directions for connectivity are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical or irregular key shapes may span height >3 if connected, breaking key detection; hole counting ignores the blob/key color value (treats as barrier) but requires grid[r][c]==0 for internal cells; border enqueue in count_holes has redundancy (corners enqueued twice) but works; if no components, output is unchanged copy.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes fixed height=3 for keys (may not generalize if keys vary); blob detection misses ==4; no handling for keys/blobs overlapping or touching borders in ways that affect hole counting; potential for 0-hole keys to map blobs with 0 enclosures.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (both passed, likely due to keys being height 3 and blobs >4).
 * Missed detecting keys in test case: vertical line of 1's forms single component height ~30 !=3, so no key_components found, no hole-to-color mapping created.
 * find_orange_blobs is broken for test case: searches for >4, but test has patterns of exactly 4, so no blobs processed; output is effectively unchanged copy of input (1's and 4's remain, rest 0's).
 * count_holes and find_key_components are helpful and correct for their logic, but unused in test due to upstream failures.
 * No prior attempts to note, but this attempt assumes fixed blob threshold >4 (not general); height==3 is rigid and misses tall keys; mapping uses min position for ties (worked in training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a full vertical column of 1's (column index 24, all rows), unchanged, and repeating patterns of 4's in rows 17-28 (columns 26-28, forming what looks like 6 vertical "E"-like or barred shapes, each 3 rows high with internal 0's), also unchanged, surrounded by 0's everywhere else.
 * This does not look correct: No recoloring occurred, suggesting the program failed to identify the 4-patterns as blobs (because ==4, not >4) or find matching keys (1's too tall for height==3 check); expected output should recolor the 4-blobs to some color 1-4 based on their enclosed holes matching a key's holes, or to 0, but instead it's static—likely the vertical 1's are meant as multiple stacked keys or a different detection rule, and 4's are the target blobs; difference is total lack of modification, which mismatches puzzle goal of transforming blobs via keys (unknown exact expected colors, but output should differ visibly in the 4 areas).

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties
The following is a list of components and properties that show clear, direct interactions or effects, based solely on consistent patterns observed across all provided examples (train input/output 1 and 2; test inputs 1 and 2 treated as puzzles for pattern identification, though outputs unavailable). Only connections present in *every* example are included—no assumptions about solving, no high-level interpretations, no irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., no isolated background, no semantic meanings like "L-shapes" unless tied to a consistent interaction, no one-off positions or colors). Interactions are limited to those that are obvious and repeatable: e.g., a property of one element reliably affects or matches a property of another across all cases. Unknowns are noted where a connection exists but the exact mechanism cannot be fully explained without forcing an interpretation.

#### Components
1. **Orange polyominoes**: Irregular clustered shapes (pixels typically 5–83, bbox varying, holes 0–5) that appear in inputs and are selectively preserved or altered in outputs (trains only). These are the primary "target" components affected by transformations.
2. **Legend shapes**: Small-to-medium non-orange colored polyominoes (pixels 8–28, bbox compact, holes 0–5, colors varying: e.g., Yellow/Green/Blue/Red in trains; Maroon/Pink/Yellow in test 1; Yellow/Dark Red/Red/Blue in test 2). These include top-row aligned shapes in trains (e.g., [1,1,3,3] to [15,1,21,3]) and right-column stacked shapes in tests (e.g., [26,1,28,5] to [26,17,28,27]). Always have unique hole counts per puzzle (no duplicates within a puzzle). These provide reference for changes to orange polyominoes.
3. **Bar shapes**: Long, thin full-extent colored rectangles (pixels ~30, bbox spanning full height or width, holes=0, always Blue). E.g., horizontal [0,5,29,5] in train 1; [0,0,9,6] in train 2; vertical [24,0,24,29] in test 1; vertical [5,0,5,29] in test 2. These are present in every example but do not affect or get affected by other components.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are pairwise or property-based connections that hold across *all* examples. No interaction is assumed if it varies (e.g., specific colors change per puzzle, so color identities are not connected—only the property of "having a color" is). Positions are relative (e.g., top vs. right), but the preservation effect is consistent.

1. **Holes property (of legend shapes) ↔ Color property (of legend shapes) → Color property (of orange polyominoes)**:
   - The holes value in a legend shape directly determines (maps to) a target color, which is then applied to any orange polyomino with the *exact same* holes value.
   - Effect: Orange polyomino color is overridden by the legend's color for matching holes (e.g., in train 1, holes=0 legend Yellow → orange holes=0 become Yellow; in train 2, holes=0 legend Red → orange holes=0 become Red; in test 1, holes=2 legend Maroon would → orange holes=2 become Maroon if output followed pattern).
   - Consistent across all: Mapping is one-to-one per holes value (unique holes in legends); only applies if exact match exists. Input orange color (always Orange) is ignored/effected (overridden).
   - Unknown: How multiple legends with same holes would resolve (none occur; always unique).

2. **Holes property (of orange polyominoes) → Presence (existence) of orange polyomino in output**:
   - If an orange polyomino's holes value matches *any* legend shape's holes, it is preserved in output (with color change per above).
   - If no matching holes in legends, the orange polyomino is removed (absent in output).
   - Effect: Controls whether the entire shape (with all its properties) appears (e.g., train 1: orange holes=4 removed, no legend holes=4; train 2: orange holes=2 removed, no legend holes=2; test 1 has legend holes=2,4,5, so oranges with 0/1/3 would be removed if pattern holds).
   - Consistent across all: Removal only for unmatched holes; no other factors (e.g., size or position) cause removal.

3. **Bbox property (position and bounding dimensions) of orange polyominoes → Bbox property in output**:
   - The bbox (x/y coordinates and width/height) of preserved orange polyominoes is exactly copied to output shapes.
   - Effect: Position and scale/orientation are preserved—no movement, rotation, or resizing (e.g., train 1: orange [8,8,11,11] → output [8,8,11,11]; train 2: [19,8,28,15] → [19,8,28,15]; holds in test inputs as baseline for potential outputs).
   - Consistent across all: Exact match for preserved shapes; no interaction with other components' bboxes (e.g., no alignment or overlap effects).

4. **Pixels property (area/size in pixels) of orange polyominoes → Pixels property in output**:
   - The pixel count of preserved orange polyominoes is exactly copied to output shapes.
   - Effect: Shape density/area is preserved—no addition/removal of units or holes (e.g., train 1: orange 11 pixels holes=0 → output 11 pixels; train 2: 46 pixels holes=1 → 46 pixels; consistent with test input sizes like 51 pixels holes=4).
   - Consistent across all: Exact match for preserved shapes; ties directly to bbox preservation (no independent scaling).

5. **Holes property of bar shapes → No effect on other components**:
   - Bars always have holes=0 and color=Blue, but this does not map to or affect any orange polyominoes (even if holes=0 legends exist elsewhere).
   - Effect: Bars are isolated—unchanged and do not influence color/presence of oranges (e.g., in train 1, Blue bar holes=0 ignored despite Yellow legend for holes=0; consistent in test vertical Blue).
   - Consistent across all: Bars unaffected by and do not affect any transformations.

6. **Color and holes properties of legend shapes → No change in output**:
   - Legend shapes' colors and holes remain identical in outputs (trains only).
   - Effect: Legends are unaffected by any mapping or orange properties—purely referential (e.g., train 1: Yellow holes=0 stays Yellow holes=0; train 2: Green holes=1 stays).
   - Consistent across all: No reciprocal effect (oranges do not alter legends).

#### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Excluded as Inconsistent or Irrelevant)
- No consistent effects from shape silhouettes, edges, or specific forms (e.g., L/T-shapes mentioned in description, but bbox/pixels capture them fully via preservation—no separate interaction).
- No position-to-color or position-to-holes effects (e.g., top vs. right placement varies but does not alter mapping; bboxes preserved independently).
- No color-to-color interactions (e.g., input vertical bar colors like purple/Maroon vary and do not consistently map across puzzles).
- No hole count changes or additions (holes preserved exactly for all preserved shapes).
- Bar shapes have no connections beyond self-preservation (isolated in every example).
- Unknown/non-forced: How legend shapes are selected if ambiguous (e.g., small top vs. stacked right)—but their role in holes-color mapping is consistent regardless of position.

This list captures only observable, repeatable property links without attempting to explain unobserved test outputs or force puzzle-wide rules.

[2025-09-30 19:21:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful for safe grid manipulation.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Perform flood fill to find connected component of cells >4 using 4-connectivity."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    blob = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.popleft()
        if visited[r][c]:
            continue
        visited[r][c] = True
        if g[r][c] <= 4:
            continue
        blob.append((r, c))
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] > 4:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return blob
```
(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components where small "key" shapes (colored 1-4, exactly 3 rows high) encode color mappings via the number of enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the border), and larger "orange" blobs (high values, potentially including 4) are recolored to match the key color associated with their own enclosed hole count, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be connected components of the same color (1-4) with exact height 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); taller or shorter components are ignored, even if they visually resemble keys (e.g., a full-height vertical line of 1's is one component of height 30, not multiple keys).
 * Holes are strictly internal 0's disconnected from the grid border; the count_holes function uses BFS from border non-barrier cells to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unmarked 0's inside the shape—subtlety: barriers are only the component cells themselves, so adjacent 0's outside the component but enclosed by it count as holes if not border-connected.
 * Multiple keys with the same hole count: select the "best" (smallest min_r, then smallest min_c) to map hole count to a single color; if no key for a blob's hole count, set blob to 0.
 * Blobs are connected components of high values (code assumes >4 for "orange"), but subtlety: in the test case, values are exactly 4, suggesting blobs may include ==4; unconnected or isolated high cells aren't blobs.
 * Grid is copied before modification to avoid altering input; directions for connectivity are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical or irregular key shapes may span height >3 if connected, breaking key detection; hole counting ignores the blob/key color value (treats as barrier) but requires grid[r][c]==0 for internal cells; border enqueue in count_holes has redundancy (corners enqueued twice) but works; if no components, output is unchanged copy.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes fixed height=3 for keys (may not generalize if keys vary); blob detection misses ==4; no handling for keys/blobs overlapping or touching borders in ways that affect hole counting; potential for 0-hole keys to map blobs with 0 enclosures.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (both passed, likely due to keys being height 3 and blobs >4).
 * Missed detecting keys in test case: vertical line of 1's forms single component height ~30 !=3, so no key_components found, no hole-to-color mapping created.
 * find_orange_blobs is broken for test case: searches for >4, but test has patterns of exactly 4, so no blobs processed; output is effectively unchanged copy of input (1's and 4's remain, rest 0's).
 * count_holes and find_key_components are helpful and correct for their logic, but unused in test due to upstream failures.
 * No prior attempts to note, but this attempt assumes fixed blob threshold >4 (not general); height==3 is rigid and misses tall keys; mapping uses min position for ties (worked in training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a full vertical column of 1's (column index 24, all rows), unchanged, and repeating patterns of 4's in rows 17-28 (columns 26-28, forming what looks like 6 vertical "E"-like or barred shapes, each 3 rows high with internal 0's), also unchanged, surrounded by 0's everywhere else.
 * This does not look correct: No recoloring occurred, suggesting the program failed to identify the 4-patterns as blobs (because ==4, not >4) or find matching keys (1's too tall for height==3 check); expected output should recolor the 4-blobs to some color 1-4 based on their enclosed holes matching a key's holes, or to 0, but instead it's static—likely the vertical 1's are meant as multiple stacked keys or a different detection rule, and 4's are the target blobs; difference is total lack of modification, which mismatches puzzle goal of transforming blobs via keys (unknown exact expected colors, but output should differ visibly in the 4 areas).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties
The following is a list of components and properties that show clear, direct interactions or effects, based solely on consistent patterns observed across all provided examples (train input/output 1 and 2; test inputs 1 and 2 treated as puzzles for pattern identification, though outputs unavailable). Only connections present in *every* example are included—no assumptions about solving, no high-level interpretations, no irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., no isolated background, no semantic meanings like "L-shapes" unless tied to a consistent interaction, no one-off positions or colors). Interactions are limited to those that are obvious and repeatable: e.g., a property of one element reliably affects or matches a property of another across all cases. Unknowns are noted where a connection exists but the exact mechanism cannot be fully explained without forcing an interpretation.

#### Components
1. **Orange polyominoes**: Irregular clustered shapes (pixels typically 5–83, bbox varying, holes 0–5) that appear in inputs and are selectively preserved or altered in outputs (trains only). These are the primary "target" components affected by transformations.
2. **Legend shapes**: Small-to-medium non-orange colored polyominoes (pixels 8–28, bbox compact, holes 0–5, colors varying: e.g., Yellow/Green/Blue/Red in trains; Maroon/Pink/Yellow in test 1; Yellow/Dark Red/Red/Blue in test 2). These include top-row aligned shapes in trains (e.g., [1,1,3,3] to [15,1,21,3]) and right-column stacked shapes in tests (e.g., [26,1,28,5] to [26,17,28,27]). Always have unique hole counts per puzzle (no duplicates within a puzzle). These provide reference for changes to orange polyominoes.
3. **Bar shapes**: Long, thin full-extent colored rectangles (pixels ~30, bbox spanning full height or width, holes=0, always Blue). E.g., horizontal [0,5,29,5] in train 1; [0,0,9,6] in train 2; vertical [24,0,24,29] in test 1; vertical [5,0,5,29] in test 2. These are present in every example but do not affect or get affected by other components.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are pairwise or property-based connections that hold across *all* examples. No interaction is assumed if it varies (e.g., specific colors change per puzzle, so color identities are not connected—only the property of "having a color" is). Positions are relative (e.g., top vs. right), but the preservation effect is consistent.

1. **Holes property (of legend shapes) ↔ Color property (of legend shapes) → Color property (of orange polyominoes)**:
   - The holes value in a legend shape directly determines (maps to) a target color, which is then applied to any orange polyomino with the *exact same* holes value.
   - Effect: Orange polyomino color is overridden by the legend's color for matching holes (e.g., in train 1, holes=0 legend Yellow → orange holes=0 become Yellow; in train 2, holes=0 legend Red → orange holes=0 become Red; in test 1, holes=2 legend Maroon would → orange holes=2 become Maroon if output followed pattern).
   - Consistent across all: Mapping is one-to-one per holes value (unique holes in legends); only applies if exact match exists. Input orange color (always Orange) is ignored/effected (overridden).
   - Unknown: How multiple legends with same holes would resolve (none occur; always unique).

2. **Holes property (of orange polyominoes) → Presence (existence) of orange polyomino in output**:
   - If an orange polyomino's holes value matches *any* legend shape's holes, it is preserved in output (with color change per above).
   - If no matching holes in legends, the orange polyomino is removed (absent in output).
   - Effect: Controls whether the entire shape (with all its properties) appears (e.g., train 1: orange holes=4 removed, no legend holes=4; train 2: orange holes=2 removed, no legend holes=2; test 1 has legend holes=2,4,5, so oranges with 0/1/3 would be removed if pattern holds).
   - Consistent across all: Removal only for unmatched holes; no other factors (e.g., size or position) cause removal.

3. **Bbox property (position and bounding dimensions) of orange polyominoes → Bbox property in output**:
   - The bbox (x/y coordinates and width/height) of preserved orange polyominoes is exactly copied to output shapes.
   - Effect: Position and scale/orientation are preserved—no movement, rotation, or resizing (e.g., train 1: orange [8,8,11,11] → output [8,8,11,11]; train 2: [19,8,28,15] → [19,8,28,15]; holds in test inputs as baseline for potential outputs).
   - Consistent across all: Exact match for preserved shapes; no interaction with other components' bboxes (e.g., no alignment or overlap effects).

4. **Pixels property (area/size in pixels) of orange polyominoes → Pixels property in output**:
   - The pixel count of preserved orange polyominoes is exactly copied to output shapes.
   - Effect: Shape density/area is preserved—no addition/removal of units or holes (e.g., train 1: orange 11 pixels holes=0 → output 11 pixels; train 2: 46 pixels holes=1 → 46 pixels; consistent with test input sizes like 51 pixels holes=4).
   - Consistent across all: Exact match for preserved shapes; ties directly to bbox preservation (no independent scaling).

5. **Holes property of bar shapes → No effect on other components**:
   - Bars always have holes=0 and color=Blue, but this does not map to or affect any orange polyominoes (even if holes=0 legends exist elsewhere).
   - Effect: Bars are isolated—unchanged and do not influence color/presence of oranges (e.g., in train 1, Blue bar holes=0 ignored despite Yellow legend for holes=0; consistent in test vertical Blue).
   - Consistent across all: Bars unaffected by and do not affect any transformations.

6. **Color and holes properties of legend shapes → No change in output**:
   - Legend shapes' colors and holes remain identical in outputs (trains only).
   - Effect: Legends are unaffected by any mapping or orange properties—purely referential (e.g., train 1: Yellow holes=0 stays Yellow holes=0; train 2: Green holes=1 stays).
   - Consistent across all: No reciprocal effect (oranges do not alter legends).

#### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Excluded as Inconsistent or Irrelevant)
- No consistent effects from shape silhouettes, edges, or specific forms (e.g., L/T-shapes mentioned in description, but bbox/pixels capture them fully via preservation—no separate interaction).
- No position-to-color or position-to-holes effects (e.g., top vs. right placement varies but does not alter mapping; bboxes preserved independently).
- No color-to-color interactions (e.g., input vertical bar colors like purple/Maroon vary and do not consistently map across puzzles).
- No hole count changes or additions (holes preserved exactly for all preserved shapes).
- Bar shapes have no connections beyond self-preservation (isolated in every example).
- Unknown/non-forced: How legend shapes are selected if ambiguous (e.g., small top vs. stacked right)—but their role in holes-color mapping is consistent regardless of position.

This list captures only observable, repeatable property links without attempting to explain unobserved test outputs or force puzzle-wide rules.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:26:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where "legend" shapes (connected components of colors 1-4 that are rectangular/large enough) define a mapping from the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") within them to their color. Orange blobs (connected regions of values >4) are then recolored based on matching their own hole count to this mapping, or set to 0 if no match, effectively classifying unknown orange shapes by their topological similarity (hole count) to known legends.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are only valid connected components (4-directional adjacency) of the same color from 1-4 that span more than one row and one column (height >1 and width >1), excluding single cells or lines.
 * Holes are fully enclosed regions of 0's (background) that are not connected to the grid border; the count_holes function correctly implements a flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unvisited 0's as distinct holes.
 * Mapping from hole count to color takes the first encountered legend for each unique hole count (sorted by position), so order matters and duplicates aren't handled—could overwrite if not careful, but code avoids it by checking "if h not in mapping".
 * Orange blobs (>4, connected 4-directionally) are recolored entirely to the mapped color if their hole count matches a legend's, or to 0 otherwise; non-orange regions (0-4) remain unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Hole counting treats the component's cells as barriers, but only counts enclosed 0's—other colors inside aren't considered holes, and the flood-fill ensures only truly enclosed areas are counted.
 * Grid is 30x30 based on outputs; assumes rectangular grid with no wrapping.
 * Potential miss: If a legend or blob touches the border, its "holes" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0; also, diagonal connections don't count (only orthogonal).
 * In mapping, only legends contribute; single-color lines or small shapes aren't legends, so ignored.
 * For blobs, if hole count doesn't match any legend, set to 0 (erasing the orange), which might be a way to "remove" unmatched unknowns.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of legends by (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent mapping order, preventing position-based variability.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies the grid to avoid mutating input.)

```python
def find_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], min_col: int, max_col: int) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    # (Full implementation as in program; uses BFS to find connected components of same color in range, tracks cells, bounding box.)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'cells', 'color', 'min_r', etc. Helpful for extracting legends.
```
(Extracts connected same-color regions for 1-4; adaptable for blobs by changing color check.)

```python
def find_orange_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    # (Full implementation; BFS for connected >4 regions, tracks cells and bounding box.)
    # Similar to above but for orange (>4); no color stored since uniform.
```
(Extracts orange regions to process.)

```python
def is_legend(comp: Dict[str, any]) -> bool:
    height = comp['max_r'] - comp['min_r'] + 1
    width = comp['max_c'] - comp['min_c'] + 1
    return height > 1 and width > 1
```
(Filters components to only large 2D shapes as legends.)

```python
def count_holes(grid: List[List[int]], component_cells: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # (Full implementation; marks barriers from component cells, floods from borders to mark exterior, then counts connected unvisited 0-regions as holes.)
    # Core topology function; correctly handles enclosure by treating component as solid barrier.
```
(Essential for computing hole counts in both legends and blobs.)

```python
def build_hole_to_color_mapping(legends: List[Dict[str, any]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    # (Sorts legends by position, computes holes for each, maps unique hole counts to first matching color.)
    # Builds the key mapping; sorting ensures determinism.
```
(Combines legends and hole counting into mapping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission provided; it correctly solved training example 1, indicating solid understanding of legend extraction, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output colored the large central shape (around rows 2-6, cols 13-23) entirely as 1's, but expected 2's; also left some small areas (e.g., row 1 cols 18-19 as 1's instead of 2's, row 9 cols 10-12 as 1's instead of 2's) mismatched, and bottom orange blobs (rows 19-29, various cols) have partial recoloring (some 3's remain or are wrong, e.g., row 20 cols 20-21 as 3's but expected partial 3's with 2's nearby? Wait, differences are scattered—e.g., row 9 col 10-12: generated 1's vs expected 2's; row 15 col 21-22: generated 3's vs expected 0's? Unknown exact cause, but likely miscomputed hole count for the central blob or wrong legend mapping due to multiple legends with overlapping hole counts).
 * What worked: Legend detection and basic BFS for components/holes seems robust (passed train1); mapping logic applies correctly when hole counts are unique/simple.
 * What didn't: In train2, the central blob was treated as having a hole count matching color 1's legend instead of 2's, suggesting either wrong hole count (e.g., overcounting/underCounting enclosures due to barrier setup) or mapping overwrite/selection error from sorting; also, some orange sub-blobs weren't fully recolored, leaving 3's where expected 2's or 0's.
 * count_holes is helpful and seems correct (no issues in train1), but may fail if component cells don't fully barrier internal 0's (e.g., if legend has internal non-0 but code only barriers the legend cells).
 * find_orange_blobs is helpful but in train2 didn't group all connected >4 properly, leading to partial coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided seem relevant, though get_legends wrapper is just a filter and could be inlined.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It introduces a vertical column of 1's (column 24, rows 0-29) where the input likely had 0's or empty space, suggesting erroneous detection of a "legend" or blob there (possibly misreading a thin vertical structure as a legend with holes mapping to 1, or a bug in component finding treating border/empty as component).
 * The bottom orange regions (rows 18-29, cols 25-28 with 4's, likely >4 in input but shown as 4's—wait, code treats >4 as orange, but output leaves most 4's unchanged, indicating either input has exactly 4 (treated as legend, not blob) or bug in find_orange_blobs (if values=4 not >4, they stay as-is, but expected recoloring suggests they should be blobs—possible subtlety: input may use 5+ for orange, but output shows 4's untouched, meaning no recoloring happened, wrong if they match a hole mapping).
 * Upper grid is all 0's except the spurious 1's column, implying no legends/blobs detected in top (possibly correct if test has isolated elements), but the unchanged 4's in bottom suggest failure to identify them as recolorable blobs (e.g., if they are connected but hole count doesn't match, should be 0's, not left as 4's—output has them as 4's with some 0's inside, indicating no processing).
 * Overall, test output makes little sense: Spurious 1's column is an artifact (likely false positive component), and lack of recoloring on bottom 4's/0's mix means blobs weren't processed or mapped (expected probably to color bottom blobs to a legend color like 1-3 based on holes, but instead partial original values remain); this highlights a bug in threshold (>4) or hole computation for test's topology.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 19:27:25] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), the following are the only consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to obvious, direct links between properties or components where one clearly affects or determines another (e.g., a property of one element transforms a property of another). Only elements with consistent behavior in both trains are included—no high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., background black canvas, which has no observed interactions), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., specific color mappings vary by example, so only the general mechanism is noted as consistent). Positions (bbox), topology (holes), and size (pixels) are preserved for affected elements unless noted. No assumptions about test inputs are made, as consistency must hold across all provided examples (trains). Transformations for holes >=2 are partially unknown in Train 2 (see notes).

#### 1. **Legend Components (Top-Row Small Polyominoes) ↔ Hole Count Property → Output Color of Orange Shapes**
   - **Description**: The small polyominoes in the top row (e.g., positions starting at low x like [1,1,...] and [5,1,...]) have assigned hole counts (starting from 0 and increasing sequentially by 1 per component). Their color property directly determines (maps to) the output color for any orange input shape with a matching hole count. This is a one-to-one index-based connection: the k-th legend component (k starting at 0) links to hole count = k.
     - Consistent in Train 1: 4 legend components (holes=0→yellow, 1→green, 2→blue, 3→red).
     - Consistent in Train 2: 2 legend components (holes=0→red, 1→green); no further legend items, so mapping stops at k=1.
   - **Affected Elements**: Orange polyominoes (primary input shapes).
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Input orange shape's hole count property queries the matching legend index (if exists) and adopts that legend's color as its output color.
     - Preserves: bbox, holes, pixels (exact match in both trains for transformed shapes).
     - Example: In both trains, all orange shapes with holes=0 adopt the color of the 1st legend (yellow in Train 1, red in Train 2); holes=1 adopt the 2nd legend's color (green in both).
   - **Consistency Note**: This mapping mechanism is identical in both trains, though the number of legend items and their specific colors vary (Train 1 has 4, Train 2 has 2). No interaction if no matching legend index exists (see omission below).
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Specific color values per index are not fixed (e.g., index 0 is yellow in Train 1, red in Train 2); only the hole-to-index link is consistent.

#### 2. **Orange Polyominoes → Legend Mapping → Color Transformation (with Omission for Unmapped Holes)**
   - **Description**: Orange polyominoes (irregular, scattered input shapes) have their color property transformed based on interaction with the legend (via hole count, as above). If no matching legend index exists for the hole count, the shape is omitted from output (no transformation occurs).
     - Consistent in Train 1: Oranges with holes=0,1,2,3 transformed per legend; holes=4 omitted (no 4th index).
     - Consistent in Train 2: Oranges with holes=0,1 transformed per legend; holes=2 omitted (no 2nd index).
   - **Affected Elements**: Only orange-colored input shapes (non-orange shapes unaffected).
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Hole count of orange shape → selects legend index k (if k <= number of legend items) → output color = legend k's color.
     - Preserves: bbox, holes, pixels for successfully transformed shapes (exact matches in both trains).
     - No overlaps or new shapes created; outputs are direct 1:1 replacements for mappable oranges.
   - **Consistency Note**: Omission for unmapped holes (holes > max legend index) occurs in both trains. All transformed oranges retain identical non-color properties.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Reason for omission (vs. default color or other transformation) is unknown; no consistent alternative behavior observed. Specific output positions match input exactly, but no further position-based effects noted.

#### 3. **Non-Orange Shapes (Lines and Accents) → No Transformation**
   - **Description**: Non-orange shapes (e.g., blue lines or other colored accents) have no interactions with other components; all properties are preserved identically in output without change.
     - Consistent in Train 1: Blue horizontal line (holes=0, bbox=[0,5,29,5], pixels=30) preserved as blue.
     - Consistent in Train 2: Blue shape (holes=0, bbox=[0,0,9,6], pixels=16) preserved as blue.
   - **Affected Elements**: None (self-preservation only).
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Color, holes, bbox, pixels all unchanged (exact matches in both trains).
     - No connection to orange shapes, legend, or holes of other elements.
   - **Consistency Note**: These are isolated (no effects on/from other components) but included as they consistently appear and persist without alteration. In Train 2, the initial red (holes=0) and green (holes=1) small shapes are also preserved (functioning as legend but with no further interaction beyond mapping).

#### Additional Notes on Scope and Exclusions
- **No Other Consistent Interactions Observed**:
  - No position (bbox) effects on color, movement, or transformation (bbox preserved but not causative).
  - No pixel count effects on anything (preserved but inert).
  - No shape-specific properties (e.g., L-shape, T-shape, edges, silhouettes) consistently link to transformations; only holes are used.
  - No color-to-color interactions (e.g., input accents don't affect legend or oranges consistently; right-edge accents in description not explicitly linked in train lists).
  - No consistent handling for holes >3 (omitted in Train 1) or holes=2 without legend (omitted in Train 2); called out as unknown above.
- **Irrelevant/Excluded Elements**: Background (black canvas) has no connections. Any shapes without matching input-output pairs or consistent behavior (e.g., potentially omitted high-hole oranges) are not linked. No semantic meanings (e.g., letters like 'B') show consistent interactions across trains.
- **General Consistency**: All listed interactions hold exactly in both Train 1 and Train 2. No forcing of unobserved links (e.g., no assumed wrapping of holes mod 4, as h=4 omission in Train 1 contradicts this).


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:30:37] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful for safe grid manipulation.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Perform flood fill to find connected component of cells >4 using 4-connectivity."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    blob = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.popleft()
        if visited[r][c]:
            continue
        visited[r][c] = True
        if g[r][c] <= 4:
            continue
        blob.append((r, c))
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] > 4:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return blob
```
(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components where small "key" shapes (colored 1-4, exactly 3 rows high) encode color mappings via the number of enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the border), and larger "orange" blobs (high values, potentially including 4) are recolored to match the key color associated with their own enclosed hole count, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be connected components of the same color (1-4) with exact height 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); taller or shorter components are ignored, even if they visually resemble keys (e.g., a full-height vertical line of 1's is one component of height 30, not multiple keys).
 * Holes are strictly internal 0's disconnected from the grid border; the count_holes function uses BFS from border non-barrier cells to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unmarked 0's inside the shape—subtlety: barriers are only the component cells themselves, so adjacent 0's outside the component but enclosed by it count as holes if not border-connected.
 * Multiple keys with the same hole count: select the "best" (smallest min_r, then smallest min_c) to map hole count to a single color; if no key for a blob's hole count, set blob to 0.
 * Blobs are connected components of high values (code assumes >4 for "orange"), but subtlety: in the test case, values are exactly 4, suggesting blobs may include ==4; unconnected or isolated high cells aren't blobs.
 * Grid is copied before modification to avoid altering input; directions for connectivity are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical or irregular key shapes may span height >3 if connected, breaking key detection; hole counting ignores the blob/key color value (treats as barrier) but requires grid[r][c]==0 for internal cells; border enqueue in count_holes has redundancy (corners enqueued twice) but works; if no components, output is unchanged copy.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes fixed height=3 for keys (may not generalize if keys vary); blob detection misses ==4; no handling for keys/blobs overlapping or touching borders in ways that affect hole counting; potential for 0-hole keys to map blobs with 0 enclosures.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (both passed, likely due to keys being height 3 and blobs >4).
 * Missed detecting keys in test case: vertical line of 1's forms single component height ~30 !=3, so no key_components found, no hole-to-color mapping created.
 * find_orange_blobs is broken for test case: searches for >4, but test has patterns of exactly 4, so no blobs processed; output is effectively unchanged copy of input (1's and 4's remain, rest 0's).
 * count_holes and find_key_components are helpful and correct for their logic, but unused in test due to upstream failures.
 * No prior attempts to note, but this attempt assumes fixed blob threshold >4 (not general); height==3 is rigid and misses tall keys; mapping uses min position for ties (worked in training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a full vertical column of 1's (column index 24, all rows), unchanged, and repeating patterns of 4's in rows 17-28 (columns 26-28, forming what looks like 6 vertical "E"-like or barred shapes, each 3 rows high with internal 0's), also unchanged, surrounded by 0's everywhere else.
 * This does not look correct: No recoloring occurred, suggesting the program failed to identify the 4-patterns as blobs (because ==4, not >4) or find matching keys (1's too tall for height==3 check); expected output should recolor the 4-blobs to some color 1-4 based on their enclosed holes matching a key's holes, or to 0, but instead it's static—likely the vertical 1's are meant as multiple stacked keys or a different detection rule, and 4's are the target blobs; difference is total lack of modification, which mismatches puzzle goal of transforming blobs via keys (unknown exact expected colors, but output should differ visibly in the 4 areas).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where "legend" shapes (connected components of colors 1-4 that are rectangular/large enough) define a mapping from the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") within them to their color. Orange blobs (connected regions of values >4) are then recolored based on matching their own hole count to this mapping, or set to 0 if no match, effectively classifying unknown orange shapes by their topological similarity (hole count) to known legends.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are only valid connected components (4-directional adjacency) of the same color from 1-4 that span more than one row and one column (height >1 and width >1), excluding single cells or lines.
 * Holes are fully enclosed regions of 0's (background) that are not connected to the grid border; the count_holes function correctly implements a flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unvisited 0's as distinct holes.
 * Mapping from hole count to color takes the first encountered legend for each unique hole count (sorted by position), so order matters and duplicates aren't handled—could overwrite if not careful, but code avoids it by checking "if h not in mapping".
 * Orange blobs (>4, connected 4-directionally) are recolored entirely to the mapped color if their hole count matches a legend's, or to 0 otherwise; non-orange regions (0-4) remain unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Hole counting treats the component's cells as barriers, but only counts enclosed 0's—other colors inside aren't considered holes, and the flood-fill ensures only truly enclosed areas are counted.
 * Grid is 30x30 based on outputs; assumes rectangular grid with no wrapping.
 * Potential miss: If a legend or blob touches the border, its "holes" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0; also, diagonal connections don't count (only orthogonal).
 * In mapping, only legends contribute; single-color lines or small shapes aren't legends, so ignored.
 * For blobs, if hole count doesn't match any legend, set to 0 (erasing the orange), which might be a way to "remove" unmatched unknowns.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of legends by (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent mapping order, preventing position-based variability.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies the grid to avoid mutating input.)

```python
def find_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], min_col: int, max_col: int) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    # (Full implementation as in program; uses BFS to find connected components of same color in range, tracks cells, bounding box.)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'cells', 'color', 'min_r', etc. Helpful for extracting legends.
```
(Extracts connected same-color regions for 1-4; adaptable for blobs by changing color check.)

```python
def find_orange_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    # (Full implementation; BFS for connected >4 regions, tracks cells and bounding box.)
    # Similar to above but for orange (>4); no color stored since uniform.
```
(Extracts orange regions to process.)

```python
def is_legend(comp: Dict[str, any]) -> bool:
    height = comp['max_r'] - comp['min_r'] + 1
    width = comp['max_c'] - comp['min_c'] + 1
    return height > 1 and width > 1
```
(Filters components to only large 2D shapes as legends.)

```python
def count_holes(grid: List[List[int]], component_cells: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # (Full implementation; marks barriers from component cells, floods from borders to mark exterior, then counts connected unvisited 0-regions as holes.)
    # Core topology function; correctly handles enclosure by treating component as solid barrier.
```
(Essential for computing hole counts in both legends and blobs.)

```python
def build_hole_to_color_mapping(legends: List[Dict[str, any]], g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    # (Sorts legends by position, computes holes for each, maps unique hole counts to first matching color.)
    # Builds the key mapping; sorting ensures determinism.
```
(Combines legends and hole counting into mapping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission provided; it correctly solved training example 1, indicating solid understanding of legend extraction, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output colored the large central shape (around rows 2-6, cols 13-23) entirely as 1's, but expected 2's; also left some small areas (e.g., row 1 cols 18-19 as 1's instead of 2's, row 9 cols 10-12 as 1's instead of 2's) mismatched, and bottom orange blobs (rows 19-29, various cols) have partial recoloring (some 3's remain or are wrong, e.g., row 20 cols 20-21 as 3's but expected partial 3's with 2's nearby? Wait, differences are scattered—e.g., row 9 col 10-12: generated 1's vs expected 2's; row 15 col 21-22: generated 3's vs expected 0's? Unknown exact cause, but likely miscomputed hole count for the central blob or wrong legend mapping due to multiple legends with overlapping hole counts).
 * What worked: Legend detection and basic BFS for components/holes seems robust (passed train1); mapping logic applies correctly when hole counts are unique/simple.
 * What didn't: In train2, the central blob was treated as having a hole count matching color 1's legend instead of 2's, suggesting either wrong hole count (e.g., overcounting/underCounting enclosures due to barrier setup) or mapping overwrite/selection error from sorting; also, some orange sub-blobs weren't fully recolored, leaving 3's where expected 2's or 0's.
 * count_holes is helpful and seems correct (no issues in train1), but may fail if component cells don't fully barrier internal 0's (e.g., if legend has internal non-0 but code only barriers the legend cells).
 * find_orange_blobs is helpful but in train2 didn't group all connected >4 properly, leading to partial coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided seem relevant, though get_legends wrapper is just a filter and could be inlined.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It introduces a vertical column of 1's (column 24, rows 0-29) where the input likely had 0's or empty space, suggesting erroneous detection of a "legend" or blob there (possibly misreading a thin vertical structure as a legend with holes mapping to 1, or a bug in component finding treating border/empty as component).
 * The bottom orange regions (rows 18-29, cols 25-28 with 4's, likely >4 in input but shown as 4's—wait, code treats >4 as orange, but output leaves most 4's unchanged, indicating either input has exactly 4 (treated as legend, not blob) or bug in find_orange_blobs (if values=4 not >4, they stay as-is, but expected recoloring suggests they should be blobs—possible subtlety: input may use 5+ for orange, but output shows 4's untouched, meaning no recoloring happened, wrong if they match a hole mapping).
 * Upper grid is all 0's except the spurious 1's column, implying no legends/blobs detected in top (possibly correct if test has isolated elements), but the unchanged 4's in bottom suggest failure to identify them as recolorable blobs (e.g., if they are connected but hole count doesn't match, should be 0's, not left as 4's—output has them as 4's with some 0's inside, indicating no processing).
 * Overall, test output makes little sense: Spurious 1's column is an artifact (likely false positive component), and lack of recoloring on bottom 4's/0's mix means blobs weren't processed or mapped (expected probably to color bottom blobs to a legend color like 1-3 based on holes, but instead partial original values remain); this highlights a bug in threshold (>4) or hole computation for test's topology.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), the following are the only consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to obvious, direct links between properties or components where one clearly affects or determines another (e.g., a property of one element transforms a property of another). Only elements with consistent behavior in both trains are included—no high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., background black canvas, which has no observed interactions), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., specific color mappings vary by example, so only the general mechanism is noted as consistent). Positions (bbox), topology (holes), and size (pixels) are preserved for affected elements unless noted. No assumptions about test inputs are made, as consistency must hold across all provided examples (trains). Transformations for holes >=2 are partially unknown in Train 2 (see notes).

#### 1. **Legend Components (Top-Row Small Polyominoes) ↔ Hole Count Property → Output Color of Orange Shapes**
   - **Description**: The small polyominoes in the top row (e.g., positions starting at low x like [1,1,...] and [5,1,...]) have assigned hole counts (starting from 0 and increasing sequentially by 1 per component). Their color property directly determines (maps to) the output color for any orange input shape with a matching hole count. This is a one-to-one index-based connection: the k-th legend component (k starting at 0) links to hole count = k.
     - Consistent in Train 1: 4 legend components (holes=0→yellow, 1→green, 2→blue, 3→red).
     - Consistent in Train 2: 2 legend components (holes=0→red, 1→green); no further legend items, so mapping stops at k=1.
   - **Affected Elements**: Orange polyominoes (primary input shapes).
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Input orange shape's hole count property queries the matching legend index (if exists) and adopts that legend's color as its output color.
     - Preserves: bbox, holes, pixels (exact match in both trains for transformed shapes).
     - Example: In both trains, all orange shapes with holes=0 adopt the color of the 1st legend (yellow in Train 1, red in Train 2); holes=1 adopt the 2nd legend's color (green in both).
   - **Consistency Note**: This mapping mechanism is identical in both trains, though the number of legend items and their specific colors vary (Train 1 has 4, Train 2 has 2). No interaction if no matching legend index exists (see omission below).
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Specific color values per index are not fixed (e.g., index 0 is yellow in Train 1, red in Train 2); only the hole-to-index link is consistent.

#### 2. **Orange Polyominoes → Legend Mapping → Color Transformation (with Omission for Unmapped Holes)**
   - **Description**: Orange polyominoes (irregular, scattered input shapes) have their color property transformed based on interaction with the legend (via hole count, as above). If no matching legend index exists for the hole count, the shape is omitted from output (no transformation occurs).
     - Consistent in Train 1: Oranges with holes=0,1,2,3 transformed per legend; holes=4 omitted (no 4th index).
     - Consistent in Train 2: Oranges with holes=0,1 transformed per legend; holes=2 omitted (no 2nd index).
   - **Affected Elements**: Only orange-colored input shapes (non-orange shapes unaffected).
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Hole count of orange shape → selects legend index k (if k <= number of legend items) → output color = legend k's color.
     - Preserves: bbox, holes, pixels for successfully transformed shapes (exact matches in both trains).
     - No overlaps or new shapes created; outputs are direct 1:1 replacements for mappable oranges.
   - **Consistency Note**: Omission for unmapped holes (holes > max legend index) occurs in both trains. All transformed oranges retain identical non-color properties.
   - **Unknown Aspect**: Reason for omission (vs. default color or other transformation) is unknown; no consistent alternative behavior observed. Specific output positions match input exactly, but no further position-based effects noted.

#### 3. **Non-Orange Shapes (Lines and Accents) → No Transformation**
   - **Description**: Non-orange shapes (e.g., blue lines or other colored accents) have no interactions with other components; all properties are preserved identically in output without change.
     - Consistent in Train 1: Blue horizontal line (holes=0, bbox=[0,5,29,5], pixels=30) preserved as blue.
     - Consistent in Train 2: Blue shape (holes=0, bbox=[0,0,9,6], pixels=16) preserved as blue.
   - **Affected Elements**: None (self-preservation only).
   - **Interaction Details**:
     - Color, holes, bbox, pixels all unchanged (exact matches in both trains).
     - No connection to orange shapes, legend, or holes of other elements.
   - **Consistency Note**: These are isolated (no effects on/from other components) but included as they consistently appear and persist without alteration. In Train 2, the initial red (holes=0) and green (holes=1) small shapes are also preserved (functioning as legend but with no further interaction beyond mapping).

#### Additional Notes on Scope and Exclusions
- **No Other Consistent Interactions Observed**:
  - No position (bbox) effects on color, movement, or transformation (bbox preserved but not causative).
  - No pixel count effects on anything (preserved but inert).
  - No shape-specific properties (e.g., L-shape, T-shape, edges, silhouettes) consistently link to transformations; only holes are used.
  - No color-to-color interactions (e.g., input accents don't affect legend or oranges consistently; right-edge accents in description not explicitly linked in train lists).
  - No consistent handling for holes >3 (omitted in Train 1) or holes=2 without legend (omitted in Train 2); called out as unknown above.
- **Irrelevant/Excluded Elements**: Background (black canvas) has no connections. Any shapes without matching input-output pairs or consistent behavior (e.g., potentially omitted high-hole oranges) are not linked. No semantic meanings (e.g., letters like 'B') show consistent interactions across trains.
- **General Consistency**: All listed interactions hold exactly in both Train 1 and Train 2. No forcing of unobserved links (e.g., no assumed wrapping of holes mod 4, as h=4 omission in Train 1 contradicts this).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 19:37:35] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with legend shapes (small connected components of colors 1-4 that span exactly 3 rows in height) and larger blob shapes (connected regions to be colored). The goal is to color each blob uniformly using the color from the h-th legend (sorted by position), where h is the number of enclosed holes (isolated connected 0-regions inside the blob, treating the blob as a barrier), if h is less than the number of legends; otherwise, clear the blob to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are connected components of the same color (1-4) with a bounding box height exactly 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); they are not necessarily vertical bars but any connected shape spanning exactly 3 rows vertically; only these are collected and sorted by (min_r, min_c) for indexing.
 * Blobs are connected components of cells >4 (using 4-directional connectivity); the program assumes unknowns are marked >4, but this misses cases where blobs use colors 1-4 (e.g., test uses 4 for the blob).
 * Hole counting treats blob cells as barriers: flood-fill from grid borders through non-barrier (non-blob) cells to mark exterior space (including 0s and other non-blobs); then, each separate connected component of unvisited 0s inside the barriers counts as one hole (not per cell, but per enclosed region).
 * Output starts as a copy of input; only blobs are modified (colored or cleared); legends and other cells (e.g., tall components of 1-4, background 0s) remain unchanged.
 * Subtle: Legends must be exactly height 3; taller or shorter connected 1-4 components (like the test's full-height 1 column or 11-row 4 blob) are ignored as legends and not treated as blobs if <=4, leaving them unchanged—which can produce incorrect outputs if such components are meant to be the blobs.
 * Subtle: Hole flood-fill starts only from border cells (top/bottom rows fully, left/right columns); interior non-0 non-blobs might affect enclosure if not handled, but code marks all reachable non-barrier from borders.
 * Subtle: If no legends (len(legends)==0), all blobs get h < 0 false, so cleared to 0 regardless of holes.
 * Subtle: Multiple blobs are processed independently; each gets its own hole count relative to global legends list.
 * Consideration: Grid is rectangular (e.g., 30x30 in test); assumes uniform size; 0 is background/empty, but only 0s count as potential holes (non-0 interiors don't count as holes).
 * Consideration: Connected components use BFS (deque stack, but popleft makes it BFS); 4 directions (orthogonal, no diagonals).
 * Easy to miss: The test blob (4s) encloses holes (e.g., the 0s in column 27, rows 18,20,etc., might form enclosed regions if treated as blob); visually, the 4 pattern looks like stacked "E" or bars with gaps, likely having 1+ holes per section, but code doesn't process it.
 * Easy to miss: If blobs touch borders, their "interior" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0.
 * Across attempts: Only this one attempt shown; assumes prior ones led here, but focuses on >4 blobs working for training but failing when blobs reuse 1-4 colors.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies grid to avoid mutating input; essential for output.)

```python
def find_legends(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Extracts and sorts height-3 connected components of 1-4; returns list of dicts with 'color', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'cells'; useful but misses non-height-3 1-4 as potential blobs.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Flood-fills connected >4 components; returns list of dicts with 'cells'; helpful for >4 cases but broken for test—ignores <=4 non-legends; suggest generalizing to connected non-0 non-legends.)

```python
def count_holes(grid: List[List[int]], component_cells: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Flood-fills exterior from borders treating component as barriers, then counts connected 0-components in interior; accurate for enclosure but assumes 0s only for holes and component fully encloses; helpful and correct in logic, but depends on correct blob detection.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Orchestrates: copy, find legends, find blobs, color each blob based on holes vs. legends index; works end-to-end for >4 blobs but fails when blobs are <=4.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identified and colored blobs in training examples 1 and 2, where blobs were likely marked >4 and hole counts matched legend indexing properly.
 * Failed to detect the test blob (connected 4s, height 11) as it uses color 4 (<=4 and not height 3), so treated as neither legend nor blob—left unchanged as 4s, producing output with uncolored blob structure.
 * The tall vertical 1s (height 30) were not detected as legend (height !=3) and not blob (<=4), so left as 1s—likely correct if it's a non-colorable element, but unclear without expected output.
 * No legends detected in test (only height-3 qualify, and neither 1s nor 4s match), so even if blobs were found, they'd clear to 0; but since no blobs, nothing changes.
 * find_blobs is helpful for >4 but broken/not general for test (misses 1-4 blobs); don't use as-is—extend to connected components excluding height-3 legends.
 * count_holes is essential and correct for hole logic, but unhelpful without proper blob extraction.
 * find_legends is essential for color keys but too narrow (only height==3); misses if test has no such legends.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond narrow blob detection; copy_grid and component finding (BFS) are solid tools to reuse.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it retains the full input structure—a vertical column of 1s (column 24, all 30 rows) and a connected blob of 4s (columns 26-28, rows 17-27, forming a pattern with internal 0s like stacked bars/gaps)—without any coloring or clearing of the 4 blob, suggesting no blobs were detected or processed.
 * Expected: The 4 structure should be treated as a blob, its internal 0s (e.g., isolated in column 27) counted as holes (likely 5-6 separate hole regions from the pattern), then colored uniformly to a legend color (but no legends found, so probably cleared to 0) or perhaps to 1 if the tall 1s are misinterpreted; the output keeping 4s means the blob wasn't handled, leaving visible "unknown" regions.
 * The vertical 1s remain, which might be correct (not a blob/legend), but the overall output looks like an unchanged input with no puzzle resolution—blobs should be resolved to 1-4 or 0.
 * No >4 visible, confirming blob detection failed; the pattern suggests 1-2 holes per "E"-like section (gaps enclosed if blob is barrier), but unprocessed so unknown exact h; output differs from expected by not unifying the 4s to a single color/0.
 * Make sure to account for blobs using 1-4 colors (not just >4) and potentially no height-3 legends (e.g., use tall 1s as color source?) to handle test case.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:37:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful for safe grid manipulation.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Perform flood fill to find connected component of cells >4 using 4-connectivity."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    blob = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.popleft()
        if visited[r][c]:
            continue
        visited[r][c] = True
        if g[r][c] <= 4:
            continue
        blob.append((r, c))
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] > 4:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return blob
```
(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components where small "key" shapes (colored 1-4, exactly 3 rows high) encode color mappings via the number of enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the border), and larger "orange" blobs (high values, potentially including 4) are recolored to match the key color associated with their own enclosed hole count, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be connected components of the same color (1-4) with exact height 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); taller or shorter components are ignored, even if they visually resemble keys (e.g., a full-height vertical line of 1's is one component of height 30, not multiple keys).
 * Holes are strictly internal 0's disconnected from the grid border; the count_holes function uses BFS from border non-barrier cells to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unmarked 0's inside the shape—subtlety: barriers are only the component cells themselves, so adjacent 0's outside the component but enclosed by it count as holes if not border-connected.
 * Multiple keys with the same hole count: select the "best" (smallest min_r, then smallest min_c) to map hole count to a single color; if no key for a blob's hole count, set blob to 0.
 * Blobs are connected components of high values (code assumes >4 for "orange"), but subtlety: in the test case, values are exactly 4, suggesting blobs may include ==4; unconnected or isolated high cells aren't blobs.
 * Grid is copied before modification to avoid altering input; directions for connectivity are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical or irregular key shapes may span height >3 if connected, breaking key detection; hole counting ignores the blob/key color value (treats as barrier) but requires grid[r][c]==0 for internal cells; border enqueue in count_holes has redundancy (corners enqueued twice) but works; if no components, output is unchanged copy.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes fixed height=3 for keys (may not generalize if keys vary); blob detection misses ==4; no handling for keys/blobs overlapping or touching borders in ways that affect hole counting; potential for 0-hole keys to map blobs with 0 enclosures.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (both passed, likely due to keys being height 3 and blobs >4).
 * Missed detecting keys in test case: vertical line of 1's forms single component height ~30 !=3, so no key_components found, no hole-to-color mapping created.
 * find_orange_blobs is broken for test case: searches for >4, but test has patterns of exactly 4, so no blobs processed; output is effectively unchanged copy of input (1's and 4's remain, rest 0's).
 * count_holes and find_key_components are helpful and correct for their logic, but unused in test due to upstream failures.
 * No prior attempts to note, but this attempt assumes fixed blob threshold >4 (not general); height==3 is rigid and misses tall keys; mapping uses min position for ties (worked in training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a full vertical column of 1's (column index 24, all rows), unchanged, and repeating patterns of 4's in rows 17-28 (columns 26-28, forming what looks like 6 vertical "E"-like or barred shapes, each 3 rows high with internal 0's), also unchanged, surrounded by 0's everywhere else.
 * This does not look correct: No recoloring occurred, suggesting the program failed to identify the 4-patterns as blobs (because ==4, not >4) or find matching keys (1's too tall for height==3 check); expected output should recolor the 4-blobs to some color 1-4 based on their enclosed holes matching a key's holes, or to 0, but instead it's static—likely the vertical 1's are meant as multiple stacked keys or a different detection rule, and 4's are the target blobs; difference is total lack of modification, which mismatches puzzle goal of transforming blobs via keys (unknown exact expected colors, but output should differ visibly in the 4 areas).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where "legend" shapes (connected components of colors 1-4 that are rectangular/large enough) define a mapping from the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") within them to their color. Orange blobs (connected regions of values >4) are then recolored based on matching their own hole count to this mapping, or set to 0 if no match, effectively classifying unknown orange shapes by their topological similarity (hole count) to known legends.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are only valid connected components (4-directional adjacency) of the same color from 1-4 that span more than one row and one column (height >1 and width >1), excluding single cells or lines.
 * Holes are fully enclosed regions of 0's (background) that are not connected to the grid border; the count_holes function correctly implements a flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unvisited 0's as distinct holes.
 * Mapping from hole count to color takes the first encountered legend for each unique hole count (sorted by position), so order matters and duplicates aren't handled—could overwrite if not careful, but code avoids it by checking "if h not in mapping".
 * Orange blobs (>4, connected 4-directionally) are recolored entirely to the mapped color if their hole count matches a legend's, or to 0 otherwise; non-orange regions (0-4) remain unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Hole counting treats the component's cells as barriers, but only counts enclosed 0's—other colors inside aren't considered holes, and the flood-fill ensures only truly enclosed areas are counted.
 * Grid is 30x30 based on outputs; assumes rectangular grid with no wrapping.
 * Potential miss: If a legend or blob touches the border, its "holes" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0; also, diagonal connections don't count (only orthogonal).
 * In mapping, only legends contribute; single-color lines or small shapes aren't legends, so ignored.
 * For blobs, if hole count doesn't match any legend, set to 0 (erasing the orange), which might be a way to "remove" unmatched unknowns.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of legends by (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent mapping order, preventing position-based variability.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission provided; it correctly solved training example 1, indicating solid understanding of legend extraction, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output colored the large central shape (around rows 2-6, cols 13-23) entirely as 1's, but expected 2's; also left some small areas (e.g., row 1 cols 18-19 as 1's instead of 2's, row 9 cols 10-12 as 1's instead of 2's) mismatched, and bottom orange blobs (rows 19-29, various cols) have partial recoloring (some 3's remain or are wrong, e.g., row 20 cols 20-21 as 3's but expected partial 3's with 2's nearby? Wait, differences are scattered—e.g., row 9 col 10-12: generated 1's vs expected 2's; row 15 col 21-22: generated 3's vs expected 0's? Unknown exact cause, but likely miscomputed hole count for the central blob or wrong legend mapping due to multiple legends with overlapping hole counts).
 * What worked: Legend detection and basic BFS for components/holes seems robust (passed train1); mapping logic applies correctly when hole counts are unique/simple.
 * What didn't: In train2, the central blob was treated as having a hole count matching color 1's legend instead of 2's, suggesting either wrong hole count (e.g., overcounting/underCounting enclosures due to barrier setup) or mapping overwrite/selection error from sorting; also, some orange sub-blobs weren't fully recolored, leaving 3's where expected 2's or 0's.
 * count_holes is helpful and seems correct (no issues in train1), but may fail if component cells don't fully barrier internal 0's (e.g., if legend has internal non-0 but code only barriers the legend cells).
 * find_orange_blobs is helpful but in train2 didn't group all connected >4 properly, leading to partial coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided seem relevant, though get_legends wrapper is just a filter and could be inlined.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It introduces a vertical column of 1's (column 24, rows 0-29) where the input likely had 0's or empty space, suggesting erroneous detection of a "legend" or blob there (possibly misreading a thin vertical structure as a legend with holes mapping to 1, or a bug in component finding treating border/empty as component).
 * The bottom orange regions (rows 18-29, cols 25-28 with 4's, likely >4 in input but shown as 4's—wait, code treats >4 as orange, but output leaves most 4's unchanged, indicating either input has exactly 4 (treated as legend, not blob) or bug in find_orange_blobs (if values=4 not >4, they stay as-is, but expected recoloring suggests they should be blobs—possible subtlety: input may use 5+ for orange, but output shows 4's untouched, meaning no recoloring happened, wrong if they match a hole mapping).
 * Upper grid is all 0's except the spurious 1's column, implying no legends/blobs detected in top (possibly correct if test has isolated elements), but the unchanged 4's in bottom suggest failure to identify them as recolorable blobs (e.g., if they are connected but hole count doesn't match, should be 0's, not left as 4's—output has them as 4's with some 0's inside, indicating no processing).
 * Overall, test output makes little sense: Spurious 1's column is an artifact (likely false positive component), and lack of recoloring on bottom 4's/0's mix means blobs weren't processed or mapped (expected probably to color bottom blobs to a legend color like 1-3 based on holes, but instead partial original values remain); this highlights a bug in threshold (>4) or hole computation for test's topology.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with legend shapes (small connected components of colors 1-4 that span exactly 3 rows in height) and larger blob shapes (connected regions to be colored). The goal is to color each blob uniformly using the color from the h-th legend (sorted by position), where h is the number of enclosed holes (isolated connected 0-regions inside the blob, treating the blob as a barrier), if h is less than the number of legends; otherwise, clear the blob to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are connected components of the same color (1-4) with a bounding box height exactly 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); they are not necessarily vertical bars but any connected shape spanning exactly 3 rows vertically; only these are collected and sorted by (min_r, min_c) for indexing.
 * Blobs are connected components of cells >4 (using 4-directional connectivity); the program assumes unknowns are marked >4, but this misses cases where blobs use colors 1-4 (e.g., test uses 4 for the blob).
 * Hole counting treats blob cells as barriers: flood-fill from grid borders through non-barrier (non-blob) cells to mark exterior space (including 0s and other non-blobs); then, each separate connected component of unvisited 0s inside the barriers counts as one hole (not per cell, but per enclosed region).
 * Output starts as a copy of input; only blobs are modified (colored or cleared); legends and other cells (e.g., tall components of 1-4, background 0s) remain unchanged.
 * Subtle: Legends must be exactly height 3; taller or shorter connected 1-4 components (like the test's full-height 1 column or 11-row 4 blob) are ignored as legends and not treated as blobs if <=4, leaving them unchanged—which can produce incorrect outputs if such components are meant to be the blobs.
 * Subtle: Hole flood-fill starts only from border cells (top/bottom rows fully, left/right columns); interior non-0 non-blobs might affect enclosure if not handled, but code marks all reachable non-barrier from borders.
 * Subtle: If no legends (len(legends)==0), all blobs get h < 0 false, so cleared to 0 regardless of holes.
 * Subtle: Multiple blobs are processed independently; each gets its own hole count relative to global legends list.
 * Consideration: Grid is rectangular (e.g., 30x30 in test); assumes uniform size; 0 is background/empty, but only 0s count as potential holes (non-0 interiors don't count as holes).
 * Consideration: Connected components use BFS (deque stack, but popleft makes it BFS); 4 directions (orthogonal, no diagonals).
 * Easy to miss: The test blob (4s) encloses holes (e.g., the 0s in column 27, rows 18,20,etc., might form enclosed regions if treated as blob); visually, the 4 pattern looks like stacked "E" or bars with gaps, likely having 1+ holes per section, but code doesn't process it.
 * Easy to miss: If blobs touch borders, their "interior" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0.
 * Across attempts: Only this one attempt shown; assumes prior ones led here, but focuses on >4 blobs working for training but failing when blobs reuse 1-4 colors.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies grid to avoid mutating input; essential for output.)

```python
def find_legends(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Extracts and sorts height-3 connected components of 1-4; returns list of dicts with 'color', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'cells'; useful but misses non-height-3 1-4 as potential blobs.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Flood-fills connected >4 components; returns list of dicts with 'cells'; helpful for >4 cases but broken for test—ignores <=4 non-legends; suggest generalizing to connected non-0 non-legends.)

```python
def count_holes(grid: List[List[int]], component_cells: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Flood-fills exterior from borders treating component as barriers, then counts connected 0-components in interior; accurate for enclosure but assumes 0s only for holes and component fully encloses; helpful and correct in logic, but depends on correct blob detection.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Orchestrates: copy, find legends, find blobs, color each blob based on holes vs. legends index; works end-to-end for >4 blobs but fails when blobs are <=4.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identified and colored blobs in training examples 1 and 2, where blobs were likely marked >4 and hole counts matched legend indexing properly.
 * Failed to detect the test blob (connected 4s, height 11) as it uses color 4 (<=4 and not height 3), so treated as neither legend nor blob—left unchanged as 4s, producing output with uncolored blob structure.
 * The tall vertical 1s (height 30) were not detected as legend (height !=3) and not blob (<=4), so left as 1s—likely correct if it's a non-colorable element, but unclear without expected output.
 * No legends detected in test (only height-3 qualify, and neither 1s nor 4s match), so even if blobs were found, they'd clear to 0; but since no blobs, nothing changes.
 * find_blobs is helpful for >4 but broken/not general for test (misses 1-4 blobs); don't use as-is—extend to connected components excluding height-3 legends.
 * count_holes is essential and correct for hole logic, but unhelpful without proper blob extraction.
 * find_legends is essential for color keys but too narrow (only height==3); misses if test has no such legends.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond narrow blob detection; copy_grid and component finding (BFS) are solid tools to reuse.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it retains the full input structure—a vertical column of 1s (column 24, all 30 rows) and a connected blob of 4s (columns 26-28, rows 17-27, forming a pattern with internal 0s like stacked bars/gaps)—without any coloring or clearing of the 4 blob, suggesting no blobs were detected or processed.
 * Expected: The 4 structure should be treated as a blob, its internal 0s (e.g., isolated in column 27) counted as holes (likely 5-6 separate hole regions from the pattern), then colored uniformly to a legend color (but no legends found, so probably cleared to 0) or perhaps to 1 if the tall 1s are misinterpreted; the output keeping 4s means the blob wasn't handled, leaving visible "unknown" regions.
 * The vertical 1s remain, which might be correct (not a blob/legend), but the overall output looks like an unchanged input with no puzzle resolution—blobs should be resolved to 1-4 or 0.
 * No >4 visible, confirming blob detection failed; the pattern suggests 1-2 holes per "E"-like section (gaps enclosed if blob is barrier), but unprocessed so unknown exact h; output differs from expected by not unifying the 4s to a single color/0.
 * Make sure to account for blobs using 1-4 colors (not just >4) and potentially no height-3 legends (e.g., use tall 1s as color source?) to handle test case.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:45:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based components where small "key" shapes (connected regions of the same color 1-4 spanning exactly 3 rows) are identified, and their properties (like enclosed hole counts) are used to assign colors to larger connected components (regions of cells >=4) based on matching enclosed hole counts; unmatched large components are cleared to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be exactly 3 rows high (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3), connected via same-color (1-4) flood fill, and are sorted by their top-left position (min_r, then min_c).
 * Hole counting is not the total number of 0-cells enclosed by a component, but the number of distinct connected components of enclosed 0-cells (i.e., separate "holes" not reachable from the grid border, treating the component cells as barriers); this is computed by flooding from borders to mark reachable non-barrier cells, then counting and flooding each remaining connected group of 0 non-barrier cells.
 * Large components are connected regions of cells >=4; they are skipped (left unchanged) only if exactly 3 rows high and all cells exactly 4 (not higher); otherwise, if their hole count indexes into the list of keys (h < len(keys)), the entire component is recolored to the matching key's color; if h >= len(keys), set to 0.
 * Components with values <=4 (but not exactly 3-high all-4) are not treated as "large" since flood_fill_ge4 only includes >=4; low-value components (<=3) are ignored for recoloring unless they form keys.
 * Border flooding for holes must avoid barriers (the component cells) and only considers 0-cells as potential holes; non-0 non-barrier cells (e.g., other colors) are treated as reachable but not counted as holes.
 * Vertical or irregular shapes may lead to miscomputed heights or connections; ensure flood fills respect exact connectivity (4-directional).
 * If no keys exist or hole counts exceed available keys, large components default to 0, potentially clearing much of the grid.
 * Subtle: In hole counting, the initial border enqueue includes only non-barrier border cells, and the hole scan only increments for unvisited 0 non-barrier cells, ensuring enclosed 0-components are counted separately even if adjacent but separated by barriers elsewhere.
 * Potential miss: Keys' own holes are computed similarly, but since keys are small (3-high), they may enclose 0 or few hole components; large components' holes can be more complex due to size.
 * Ensure grid copying preserves original for output; visited marks prevent reprocessing.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Shallow copy of grid rows; essential for non-destructive output.)

```python
def flood_fill_same(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    cells = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.popleft()
        if visited[x][y]:
            continue
        visited[x][y] = True
        if g[x][y] != color:
            continue
        cells.append((x, y))
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(Useful for extracting same-color connected components, e.g., for keys; BFS-style with deque for efficiency.)

```python
def flood_fill_ge4(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    cells = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.popleft()
        if visited[x][y]:
            continue
        visited[x][y] = True
        if g[x][y] < 4:
            continue
        cells.append((x, y))
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(Helpful for extracting large (>=4) connected components; skips <4 cells mid-component.)

(Key function for computing number of enclosed 0-connected-components (holes); uses border flood to find unreachable areas, then counts separate 0-components in them. Works for both keys and large components.)

```python
def find_keys(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    keys = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if 1 <= g[r][c] <= 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                cells = flood_fill_same(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in cells)
                    max_r = max(rr for rr, _ in cells)
                    if max_r - min_r + 1 == 3:
                        h = count_holes(g, cells)
                        min_c = min(cc for _, cc in cells)
                        keys.append({'color': color, 'h': h, 'min_r': min_r, 'min_c': min_c})
    keys.sort(key=lambda d: (d['min_r'], d['min_c']))
    return keys
```
(Essential for extracting and sorting key components; filters to 3-high same-color 1-4 regions and computes their holes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; training examples 1 and 2 both passed correctly, indicating the core logic (key extraction, hole counting as connected components, and large component recoloring) works for those cases.
 * The skipping condition for 3-high all-4 components (not recoloring them) worked for training but may be a subtlety—perhaps all-4 regions are "special" or pre-colored keys/large blobs that should remain.
 * Hole counting as number of connected 0-components (not total 0-cells) appears correct since training passed; total cells might be an easy miss.
 * find_keys correctly ignores non-3-high or >4 color components for keys.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the all_low check (all <=4 in ge4 flood) is tautological for ==4 but ensures skipping pure-4 3-high; if this is wrong for test, it could leave unintended regions unchanged.
 * Potential issue: If input has only low-value keys (like the vertical 1s) and no large >=4 components, output remains mostly unchanged (e.g., just the keys visible).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 30x30 grid (inferred from list lengths) that is entirely 0s except for a single vertical column of 1s (at index 24 in each of the 30 rows), resulting in a thin, unbroken line of 1s spanning the full height.
 * This does not look correct for a typical puzzle output, as it suggests minimal processing: likely the input contained these 1s as a connected key component (possibly 3-high segments or full-height, but treated as keys), with the rest as 0s or <4, and no large >=4 components to recolor—leading to an output that is essentially the input unchanged except possibly clearing non-matching areas to 0.
 * Expected output should likely include recolored large regions (e.g., filled areas with colors 1-4 based on holes matching keys), not just an isolated vertical line; the all-0 background with only 1s indicates either no large components in input or a bug in detecting/recoloring them (e.g., if the line is not exactly 3-high per key or holes don't match).
 * Difference from expected: No evidence of hole-based coloring or component filling; if test input has enclosed 0-regions or >=4 blobs, they should appear colored, but here everything else is 0—suggests the program cleared too much or missed components (unknown why, possibly input lacks >=4 or height condition fails broadly).
 * To handle test: Ensure large components aren't skipped incorrectly (e.g., revise skipping only for exact all-4 3-high); verify if vertical keys are split into 3-high segments for multiple keys.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:45:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful for safe grid manipulation.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Perform flood fill to find connected component of cells >4 using 4-connectivity."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    blob = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.popleft()
        if visited[r][c]:
            continue
        visited[r][c] = True
        if g[r][c] <= 4:
            continue
        blob.append((r, c))
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] > 4:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return blob
```
(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components where small "key" shapes (colored 1-4, exactly 3 rows high) encode color mappings via the number of enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the border), and larger "orange" blobs (high values, potentially including 4) are recolored to match the key color associated with their own enclosed hole count, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be connected components of the same color (1-4) with exact height 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); taller or shorter components are ignored, even if they visually resemble keys (e.g., a full-height vertical line of 1's is one component of height 30, not multiple keys).
 * Holes are strictly internal 0's disconnected from the grid border; the count_holes function uses BFS from border non-barrier cells to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unmarked 0's inside the shape—subtlety: barriers are only the component cells themselves, so adjacent 0's outside the component but enclosed by it count as holes if not border-connected.
 * Multiple keys with the same hole count: select the "best" (smallest min_r, then smallest min_c) to map hole count to a single color; if no key for a blob's hole count, set blob to 0.
 * Blobs are connected components of high values (code assumes >4 for "orange"), but subtlety: in the test case, values are exactly 4, suggesting blobs may include ==4; unconnected or isolated high cells aren't blobs.
 * Grid is copied before modification to avoid altering input; directions for connectivity are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical or irregular key shapes may span height >3 if connected, breaking key detection; hole counting ignores the blob/key color value (treats as barrier) but requires grid[r][c]==0 for internal cells; border enqueue in count_holes has redundancy (corners enqueued twice) but works; if no components, output is unchanged copy.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes fixed height=3 for keys (may not generalize if keys vary); blob detection misses ==4; no handling for keys/blobs overlapping or touching borders in ways that affect hole counting; potential for 0-hole keys to map blobs with 0 enclosures.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (both passed, likely due to keys being height 3 and blobs >4).
 * Missed detecting keys in test case: vertical line of 1's forms single component height ~30 !=3, so no key_components found, no hole-to-color mapping created.
 * find_orange_blobs is broken for test case: searches for >4, but test has patterns of exactly 4, so no blobs processed; output is effectively unchanged copy of input (1's and 4's remain, rest 0's).
 * count_holes and find_key_components are helpful and correct for their logic, but unused in test due to upstream failures.
 * No prior attempts to note, but this attempt assumes fixed blob threshold >4 (not general); height==3 is rigid and misses tall keys; mapping uses min position for ties (worked in training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a full vertical column of 1's (column index 24, all rows), unchanged, and repeating patterns of 4's in rows 17-28 (columns 26-28, forming what looks like 6 vertical "E"-like or barred shapes, each 3 rows high with internal 0's), also unchanged, surrounded by 0's everywhere else.
 * This does not look correct: No recoloring occurred, suggesting the program failed to identify the 4-patterns as blobs (because ==4, not >4) or find matching keys (1's too tall for height==3 check); expected output should recolor the 4-blobs to some color 1-4 based on their enclosed holes matching a key's holes, or to 0, but instead it's static—likely the vertical 1's are meant as multiple stacked keys or a different detection rule, and 4's are the target blobs; difference is total lack of modification, which mismatches puzzle goal of transforming blobs via keys (unknown exact expected colors, but output should differ visibly in the 4 areas).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where "legend" shapes (connected components of colors 1-4 that are rectangular/large enough) define a mapping from the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") within them to their color. Orange blobs (connected regions of values >4) are then recolored based on matching their own hole count to this mapping, or set to 0 if no match, effectively classifying unknown orange shapes by their topological similarity (hole count) to known legends.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are only valid connected components (4-directional adjacency) of the same color from 1-4 that span more than one row and one column (height >1 and width >1), excluding single cells or lines.
 * Holes are fully enclosed regions of 0's (background) that are not connected to the grid border; the count_holes function correctly implements a flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unvisited 0's as distinct holes.
 * Mapping from hole count to color takes the first encountered legend for each unique hole count (sorted by position), so order matters and duplicates aren't handled—could overwrite if not careful, but code avoids it by checking "if h not in mapping".
 * Orange blobs (>4, connected 4-directionally) are recolored entirely to the mapped color if their hole count matches a legend's, or to 0 otherwise; non-orange regions (0-4) remain unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Hole counting treats the component's cells as barriers, but only counts enclosed 0's—other colors inside aren't considered holes, and the flood-fill ensures only truly enclosed areas are counted.
 * Grid is 30x30 based on outputs; assumes rectangular grid with no wrapping.
 * Potential miss: If a legend or blob touches the border, its "holes" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0; also, diagonal connections don't count (only orthogonal).
 * In mapping, only legends contribute; single-color lines or small shapes aren't legends, so ignored.
 * For blobs, if hole count doesn't match any legend, set to 0 (erasing the orange), which might be a way to "remove" unmatched unknowns.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of legends by (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent mapping order, preventing position-based variability.

(Combines legends and hole counting into mapping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission provided; it correctly solved training example 1, indicating solid understanding of legend extraction, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output colored the large central shape (around rows 2-6, cols 13-23) entirely as 1's, but expected 2's; also left some small areas (e.g., row 1 cols 18-19 as 1's instead of 2's, row 9 cols 10-12 as 1's instead of 2's) mismatched, and bottom orange blobs (rows 19-29, various cols) have partial recoloring (some 3's remain or are wrong, e.g., row 20 cols 20-21 as 3's but expected partial 3's with 2's nearby? Wait, differences are scattered—e.g., row 9 col 10-12: generated 1's vs expected 2's; row 15 col 21-22: generated 3's vs expected 0's? Unknown exact cause, but likely miscomputed hole count for the central blob or wrong legend mapping due to multiple legends with overlapping hole counts).
 * What worked: Legend detection and basic BFS for components/holes seems robust (passed train1); mapping logic applies correctly when hole counts are unique/simple.
 * What didn't: In train2, the central blob was treated as having a hole count matching color 1's legend instead of 2's, suggesting either wrong hole count (e.g., overcounting/underCounting enclosures due to barrier setup) or mapping overwrite/selection error from sorting; also, some orange sub-blobs weren't fully recolored, leaving 3's where expected 2's or 0's.
 * count_holes is helpful and seems correct (no issues in train1), but may fail if component cells don't fully barrier internal 0's (e.g., if legend has internal non-0 but code only barriers the legend cells).
 * find_orange_blobs is helpful but in train2 didn't group all connected >4 properly, leading to partial coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided seem relevant, though get_legends wrapper is just a filter and could be inlined.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It introduces a vertical column of 1's (column 24, rows 0-29) where the input likely had 0's or empty space, suggesting erroneous detection of a "legend" or blob there (possibly misreading a thin vertical structure as a legend with holes mapping to 1, or a bug in component finding treating border/empty as component).
 * The bottom orange regions (rows 18-29, cols 25-28 with 4's, likely >4 in input but shown as 4's—wait, code treats >4 as orange, but output leaves most 4's unchanged, indicating either input has exactly 4 (treated as legend, not blob) or bug in find_orange_blobs (if values=4 not >4, they stay as-is, but expected recoloring suggests they should be blobs—possible subtlety: input may use 5+ for orange, but output shows 4's untouched, meaning no recoloring happened, wrong if they match a hole mapping).
 * Upper grid is all 0's except the spurious 1's column, implying no legends/blobs detected in top (possibly correct if test has isolated elements), but the unchanged 4's in bottom suggest failure to identify them as recolorable blobs (e.g., if they are connected but hole count doesn't match, should be 0's, not left as 4's—output has them as 4's with some 0's inside, indicating no processing).
 * Overall, test output makes little sense: Spurious 1's column is an artifact (likely false positive component), and lack of recoloring on bottom 4's/0's mix means blobs weren't processed or mapped (expected probably to color bottom blobs to a legend color like 1-3 based on holes, but instead partial original values remain); this highlights a bug in threshold (>4) or hole computation for test's topology.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with legend shapes (small connected components of colors 1-4 that span exactly 3 rows in height) and larger blob shapes (connected regions to be colored). The goal is to color each blob uniformly using the color from the h-th legend (sorted by position), where h is the number of enclosed holes (isolated connected 0-regions inside the blob, treating the blob as a barrier), if h is less than the number of legends; otherwise, clear the blob to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are connected components of the same color (1-4) with a bounding box height exactly 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); they are not necessarily vertical bars but any connected shape spanning exactly 3 rows vertically; only these are collected and sorted by (min_r, min_c) for indexing.
 * Blobs are connected components of cells >4 (using 4-directional connectivity); the program assumes unknowns are marked >4, but this misses cases where blobs use colors 1-4 (e.g., test uses 4 for the blob).
 * Hole counting treats blob cells as barriers: flood-fill from grid borders through non-barrier (non-blob) cells to mark exterior space (including 0s and other non-blobs); then, each separate connected component of unvisited 0s inside the barriers counts as one hole (not per cell, but per enclosed region).
 * Output starts as a copy of input; only blobs are modified (colored or cleared); legends and other cells (e.g., tall components of 1-4, background 0s) remain unchanged.
 * Subtle: Legends must be exactly height 3; taller or shorter connected 1-4 components (like the test's full-height 1 column or 11-row 4 blob) are ignored as legends and not treated as blobs if <=4, leaving them unchanged—which can produce incorrect outputs if such components are meant to be the blobs.
 * Subtle: Hole flood-fill starts only from border cells (top/bottom rows fully, left/right columns); interior non-0 non-blobs might affect enclosure if not handled, but code marks all reachable non-barrier from borders.
 * Subtle: If no legends (len(legends)==0), all blobs get h < 0 false, so cleared to 0 regardless of holes.
 * Subtle: Multiple blobs are processed independently; each gets its own hole count relative to global legends list.
 * Consideration: Grid is rectangular (e.g., 30x30 in test); assumes uniform size; 0 is background/empty, but only 0s count as potential holes (non-0 interiors don't count as holes).
 * Consideration: Connected components use BFS (deque stack, but popleft makes it BFS); 4 directions (orthogonal, no diagonals).
 * Easy to miss: The test blob (4s) encloses holes (e.g., the 0s in column 27, rows 18,20,etc., might form enclosed regions if treated as blob); visually, the 4 pattern looks like stacked "E" or bars with gaps, likely having 1+ holes per section, but code doesn't process it.
 * Easy to miss: If blobs touch borders, their "interior" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0.
 * Across attempts: Only this one attempt shown; assumes prior ones led here, but focuses on >4 blobs working for training but failing when blobs reuse 1-4 colors.

```
(Orchestrates: copy, find legends, find blobs, color each blob based on holes vs. legends index; works end-to-end for >4 blobs but fails when blobs are <=4.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identified and colored blobs in training examples 1 and 2, where blobs were likely marked >4 and hole counts matched legend indexing properly.
 * Failed to detect the test blob (connected 4s, height 11) as it uses color 4 (<=4 and not height 3), so treated as neither legend nor blob—left unchanged as 4s, producing output with uncolored blob structure.
 * The tall vertical 1s (height 30) were not detected as legend (height !=3) and not blob (<=4), so left as 1s—likely correct if it's a non-colorable element, but unclear without expected output.
 * No legends detected in test (only height-3 qualify, and neither 1s nor 4s match), so even if blobs were found, they'd clear to 0; but since no blobs, nothing changes.
 * find_blobs is helpful for >4 but broken/not general for test (misses 1-4 blobs); don't use as-is—extend to connected components excluding height-3 legends.
 * count_holes is essential and correct for hole logic, but unhelpful without proper blob extraction.
 * find_legends is essential for color keys but too narrow (only height==3); misses if test has no such legends.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond narrow blob detection; copy_grid and component finding (BFS) are solid tools to reuse.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it retains the full input structure—a vertical column of 1s (column 24, all 30 rows) and a connected blob of 4s (columns 26-28, rows 17-27, forming a pattern with internal 0s like stacked bars/gaps)—without any coloring or clearing of the 4 blob, suggesting no blobs were detected or processed.
 * Expected: The 4 structure should be treated as a blob, its internal 0s (e.g., isolated in column 27) counted as holes (likely 5-6 separate hole regions from the pattern), then colored uniformly to a legend color (but no legends found, so probably cleared to 0) or perhaps to 1 if the tall 1s are misinterpreted; the output keeping 4s means the blob wasn't handled, leaving visible "unknown" regions.
 * The vertical 1s remain, which might be correct (not a blob/legend), but the overall output looks like an unchanged input with no puzzle resolution—blobs should be resolved to 1-4 or 0.
 * No >4 visible, confirming blob detection failed; the pattern suggests 1-2 holes per "E"-like section (gaps enclosed if blob is barrier), but unprocessed so unknown exact h; output differs from expected by not unifying the 4s to a single color/0.
 * Make sure to account for blobs using 1-4 colors (not just >4) and potentially no height-3 legends (e.g., use tall 1s as color source?) to handle test case.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based components where small "key" shapes (connected regions of the same color 1-4 spanning exactly 3 rows) are identified, and their properties (like enclosed hole counts) are used to assign colors to larger connected components (regions of cells >=4) based on matching enclosed hole counts; unmatched large components are cleared to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be exactly 3 rows high (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3), connected via same-color (1-4) flood fill, and are sorted by their top-left position (min_r, then min_c).
 * Hole counting is not the total number of 0-cells enclosed by a component, but the number of distinct connected components of enclosed 0-cells (i.e., separate "holes" not reachable from the grid border, treating the component cells as barriers); this is computed by flooding from borders to mark reachable non-barrier cells, then counting and flooding each remaining connected group of 0 non-barrier cells.
 * Large components are connected regions of cells >=4; they are skipped (left unchanged) only if exactly 3 rows high and all cells exactly 4 (not higher); otherwise, if their hole count indexes into the list of keys (h < len(keys)), the entire component is recolored to the matching key's color; if h >= len(keys), set to 0.
 * Components with values <=4 (but not exactly 3-high all-4) are not treated as "large" since flood_fill_ge4 only includes >=4; low-value components (<=3) are ignored for recoloring unless they form keys.
 * Border flooding for holes must avoid barriers (the component cells) and only considers 0-cells as potential holes; non-0 non-barrier cells (e.g., other colors) are treated as reachable but not counted as holes.
 * Vertical or irregular shapes may lead to miscomputed heights or connections; ensure flood fills respect exact connectivity (4-directional).
 * If no keys exist or hole counts exceed available keys, large components default to 0, potentially clearing much of the grid.
 * Subtle: In hole counting, the initial border enqueue includes only non-barrier border cells, and the hole scan only increments for unvisited 0 non-barrier cells, ensuring enclosed 0-components are counted separately even if adjacent but separated by barriers elsewhere.
 * Potential miss: Keys' own holes are computed similarly, but since keys are small (3-high), they may enclose 0 or few hole components; large components' holes can be more complex due to size.
 * Ensure grid copying preserves original for output; visited marks prevent reprocessing.

    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Shallow copy of grid rows; essential for non-destructive output.)

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.popleft()
        if visited[x][y]:
            continue
        visited[x][y] = True

(Useful for extracting same-color connected components, e.g., for keys; BFS-style with deque for efficiency.)

(Key function for computing number of enclosed 0-connected-components (holes); uses border flood to find unreachable areas, then counts separate 0-components in them. Works for both keys and large components.)

(Essential for extracting and sorting key components; filters to 3-high same-color 1-4 regions and computes their holes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; training examples 1 and 2 both passed correctly, indicating the core logic (key extraction, hole counting as connected components, and large component recoloring) works for those cases.
 * The skipping condition for 3-high all-4 components (not recoloring them) worked for training but may be a subtlety—perhaps all-4 regions are "special" or pre-colored keys/large blobs that should remain.
 * Hole counting as number of connected 0-components (not total 0-cells) appears correct since training passed; total cells might be an easy miss.
 * find_keys correctly ignores non-3-high or >4 color components for keys.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the all_low check (all <=4 in ge4 flood) is tautological for ==4 but ensures skipping pure-4 3-high; if this is wrong for test, it could leave unintended regions unchanged.
 * Potential issue: If input has only low-value keys (like the vertical 1s) and no large >=4 components, output remains mostly unchanged (e.g., just the keys visible).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 30x30 grid (inferred from list lengths) that is entirely 0s except for a single vertical column of 1s (at index 24 in each of the 30 rows), resulting in a thin, unbroken line of 1s spanning the full height.
 * This does not look correct for a typical puzzle output, as it suggests minimal processing: likely the input contained these 1s as a connected key component (possibly 3-high segments or full-height, but treated as keys), with the rest as 0s or <4, and no large >=4 components to recolor—leading to an output that is essentially the input unchanged except possibly clearing non-matching areas to 0.
 * Expected output should likely include recolored large regions (e.g., filled areas with colors 1-4 based on holes matching keys), not just an isolated vertical line; the all-0 background with only 1s indicates either no large components in input or a bug in detecting/recoloring them (e.g., if the line is not exactly 3-high per key or holes don't match).
 * Difference from expected: No evidence of hole-based coloring or component filling; if test input has enclosed 0-regions or >=4 blobs, they should appear colored, but here everything else is 0—suggests the program cleared too much or missed components (unknown why, possibly input lacks >=4 or height condition fails broadly).
 * To handle test: Ensure large components aren't skipped incorrectly (e.g., revise skipping only for exact all-4 3-high); verify if vertical keys are split into 3-high segments for multiple keys.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:53:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent "heights" or colors; low-height connected components (values 1-4) act as a "key" by associating their colors with the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") they create, and high-height connected blobs (values >4) are then recolored to match the key color corresponding to the number of holes they similarly enclose, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components are strictly same-value connected groups (4-directional adjacency) for values 1-4; high blobs are any connected >4 cells (regardless of exact value).
 * Holes are the number of distinct connected components of 0-cells that are fully enclosed (not reachable from the grid border via other 0-cells or non-barrier spaces); the component itself acts as a barrier during hole counting.
 * Low components are sorted by descending size, then ascending min_row, then ascending min_col (prioritizing largest, then topmost-leftmost) before building the hole-to-color mapping; only the first (highest-priority) low component per unique hole count is used in the mapping—duplicates are ignored.
 * If a high blob's hole count has no mapping, it defaults to 0 (erased); low components and 0s are never modified.
 * Border flooding in hole counting starts from all border non-barrier cells (including 0s and other non-component cells) to mark all reachable space; enclosed holes are then detected as separate connected 0-components in the unmarked interior.
 * Subtlety: Hole count is per connected 0-region (not total 0-cells), so a large empty area counts as 1 hole if connected.
 * Subtlety: Barriers for hole counting are only the cells of the current component being analyzed—other grid cells (including other components or high/low values) are traversable unless they are the barrier.
 * Subtlety: The grid may have "divider" lines or vertical/horizontal 1s (as seen in test), which could be low components themselves; ensure flood fill doesn't cross value boundaries for low comps.
 * All components must be processed in order, but mapping is global (one per hole count across all low comps).
 * 0s are empty space only for hole detection; they don't form components.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 30x30 in test), so all functions must be dimension-agnostic.

(Core hole-counting function; treats component as barrier, floods borders to mark exterior/interior reachable space, then counts connected enclosed 0-regions. Accurate and essential; correctly handles multiple holes per component.)

                if cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in cells)
                    size = len(cells)

                        'size': size
                    })
    return components
```
(Extracts all low components with metadata; uses flood_fill_same and count_holes. Helpful for building the key mapping; includes size/position for sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; no prior iterations shown.
 * Successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely correctly (full match to expected outputs).
 * For test input, the program correctly identified and left low components (1-4) unchanged, as per rules.
 * Sorting low components by (size desc, min_r asc, min_c asc) and taking first unique hole-to-color mapping worked for training, ensuring consistent key assignment.
 * Hole counting via border flood + enclosed 0-component detection is accurate and handled training cases without issues (no over/under-counting of holes).
 * High blob processing (flood fill any >4, count holes, map to color or 0) was not triggered in test (or mapped to existing low colors), as output shows only 0/1/4.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt—all provided (e.g., flood_fill_same, count_holes) are relevant, correct, and essential; avoid reinventing without need.
 * Potential subtlety missed in general: If test had >4 cells, they should appear as 1-4 or 0 in output based on holes; the code handles this but test output suggests no >4 or all mapped to 1 (e.g., the vertical 1-line and left shapes remain 1s, right 4-shapes remain 4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid with mostly 0s, scattered 1s forming shapes on the left/top (e.g., possible letters/numbers in rows 0-3, 7-14, 17-18) and a vertical line of 1s in column 24 across all rows, plus a complex shape of 4s in the bottom-right (rows 17-29, columns 25-29, forming irregular connected regions with internal 0s).
 * It makes sense as output: Low components (1s and 4s) are unchanged, 0s intact; if test input had >4 cells (e.g., in the right shape or elsewhere), they were correctly replaced (possibly to 1, explaining the 1-line if it was high-mapped). No >4 remains, as expected.
 * However, without the raw test input grid or expected output, it's unclear if mappings were applied correctly (e.g., did the 4-shape enclose holes matching a 1-key? Why not recolored?). The vertical 1-line looks like a persistent low component or mapped high, but the overall structure (left shapes as 1s, right as 4s) suggests correct non-modification of lows. It looks plausible/correct based on rules, but the right 4-shape's internal 0s (visible in rows 20-29) imply it could enclose holes—if it's low (4<=4), holes aren't used for it, but if input had >4 there, output should have recolored based on those holes (e.g., to 1 if mapping[hole_count]=1). Difference: Output retains 4s, which would be wrong if those were high >4 in input (expected recolor to key color); unknown without input, but code would handle it correctly per training success.
 * No obvious errors (e.g., no stray >4, no modified lows), so it aligns with expectations; subtle issue if test has high in 4-positions but output didn't map (but code looks fine).

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:53:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components where small "key" shapes (colored 1-4, exactly 3 rows high) encode color mappings via the number of enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the border), and larger "orange" blobs (high values, potentially including 4) are recolored to match the key color associated with their own enclosed hole count, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be connected components of the same color (1-4) with exact height 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); taller or shorter components are ignored, even if they visually resemble keys (e.g., a full-height vertical line of 1's is one component of height 30, not multiple keys).
 * Holes are strictly internal 0's disconnected from the grid border; the count_holes function uses BFS from border non-barrier cells to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unmarked 0's inside the shape—subtlety: barriers are only the component cells themselves, so adjacent 0's outside the component but enclosed by it count as holes if not border-connected.
 * Multiple keys with the same hole count: select the "best" (smallest min_r, then smallest min_c) to map hole count to a single color; if no key for a blob's hole count, set blob to 0.
 * Blobs are connected components of high values (code assumes >4 for "orange"), but subtlety: in the test case, values are exactly 4, suggesting blobs may include ==4; unconnected or isolated high cells aren't blobs.
 * Grid is copied before modification to avoid altering input; directions for connectivity are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical or irregular key shapes may span height >3 if connected, breaking key detection; hole counting ignores the blob/key color value (treats as barrier) but requires grid[r][c]==0 for internal cells; border enqueue in count_holes has redundancy (corners enqueued twice) but works; if no components, output is unchanged copy.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes fixed height=3 for keys (may not generalize if keys vary); blob detection misses ==4; no handling for keys/blobs overlapping or touching borders in ways that affect hole counting; potential for 0-hole keys to map blobs with 0 enclosures.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (both passed, likely due to keys being height 3 and blobs >4).
 * Missed detecting keys in test case: vertical line of 1's forms single component height ~30 !=3, so no key_components found, no hole-to-color mapping created.
 * find_orange_blobs is broken for test case: searches for >4, but test has patterns of exactly 4, so no blobs processed; output is effectively unchanged copy of input (1's and 4's remain, rest 0's).
 * count_holes and find_key_components are helpful and correct for their logic, but unused in test due to upstream failures.
 * No prior attempts to note, but this attempt assumes fixed blob threshold >4 (not general); height==3 is rigid and misses tall keys; mapping uses min position for ties (worked in training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a full vertical column of 1's (column index 24, all rows), unchanged, and repeating patterns of 4's in rows 17-28 (columns 26-28, forming what looks like 6 vertical "E"-like or barred shapes, each 3 rows high with internal 0's), also unchanged, surrounded by 0's everywhere else.
 * This does not look correct: No recoloring occurred, suggesting the program failed to identify the 4-patterns as blobs (because ==4, not >4) or find matching keys (1's too tall for height==3 check); expected output should recolor the 4-blobs to some color 1-4 based on their enclosed holes matching a key's holes, or to 0, but instead it's static—likely the vertical 1's are meant as multiple stacked keys or a different detection rule, and 4's are the target blobs; difference is total lack of modification, which mismatches puzzle goal of transforming blobs via keys (unknown exact expected colors, but output should differ visibly in the 4 areas).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where "legend" shapes (connected components of colors 1-4 that are rectangular/large enough) define a mapping from the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") within them to their color. Orange blobs (connected regions of values >4) are then recolored based on matching their own hole count to this mapping, or set to 0 if no match, effectively classifying unknown orange shapes by their topological similarity (hole count) to known legends.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are only valid connected components (4-directional adjacency) of the same color from 1-4 that span more than one row and one column (height >1 and width >1), excluding single cells or lines.
 * Holes are fully enclosed regions of 0's (background) that are not connected to the grid border; the count_holes function correctly implements a flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unvisited 0's as distinct holes.
 * Mapping from hole count to color takes the first encountered legend for each unique hole count (sorted by position), so order matters and duplicates aren't handled—could overwrite if not careful, but code avoids it by checking "if h not in mapping".
 * Orange blobs (>4, connected 4-directionally) are recolored entirely to the mapped color if their hole count matches a legend's, or to 0 otherwise; non-orange regions (0-4) remain unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Hole counting treats the component's cells as barriers, but only counts enclosed 0's—other colors inside aren't considered holes, and the flood-fill ensures only truly enclosed areas are counted.
 * Grid is 30x30 based on outputs; assumes rectangular grid with no wrapping.
 * Potential miss: If a legend or blob touches the border, its "holes" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0; also, diagonal connections don't count (only orthogonal).
 * In mapping, only legends contribute; single-color lines or small shapes aren't legends, so ignored.
 * For blobs, if hole count doesn't match any legend, set to 0 (erasing the orange), which might be a way to "remove" unmatched unknowns.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of legends by (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent mapping order, preventing position-based variability.

(Combines legends and hole counting into mapping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission provided; it correctly solved training example 1, indicating solid understanding of legend extraction, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output colored the large central shape (around rows 2-6, cols 13-23) entirely as 1's, but expected 2's; also left some small areas (e.g., row 1 cols 18-19 as 1's instead of 2's, row 9 cols 10-12 as 1's instead of 2's) mismatched, and bottom orange blobs (rows 19-29, various cols) have partial recoloring (some 3's remain or are wrong, e.g., row 20 cols 20-21 as 3's but expected partial 3's with 2's nearby? Wait, differences are scattered—e.g., row 9 col 10-12: generated 1's vs expected 2's; row 15 col 21-22: generated 3's vs expected 0's? Unknown exact cause, but likely miscomputed hole count for the central blob or wrong legend mapping due to multiple legends with overlapping hole counts).
 * What worked: Legend detection and basic BFS for components/holes seems robust (passed train1); mapping logic applies correctly when hole counts are unique/simple.
 * What didn't: In train2, the central blob was treated as having a hole count matching color 1's legend instead of 2's, suggesting either wrong hole count (e.g., overcounting/underCounting enclosures due to barrier setup) or mapping overwrite/selection error from sorting; also, some orange sub-blobs weren't fully recolored, leaving 3's where expected 2's or 0's.
 * count_holes is helpful and seems correct (no issues in train1), but may fail if component cells don't fully barrier internal 0's (e.g., if legend has internal non-0 but code only barriers the legend cells).
 * find_orange_blobs is helpful but in train2 didn't group all connected >4 properly, leading to partial coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided seem relevant, though get_legends wrapper is just a filter and could be inlined.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It introduces a vertical column of 1's (column 24, rows 0-29) where the input likely had 0's or empty space, suggesting erroneous detection of a "legend" or blob there (possibly misreading a thin vertical structure as a legend with holes mapping to 1, or a bug in component finding treating border/empty as component).
 * The bottom orange regions (rows 18-29, cols 25-28 with 4's, likely >4 in input but shown as 4's—wait, code treats >4 as orange, but output leaves most 4's unchanged, indicating either input has exactly 4 (treated as legend, not blob) or bug in find_orange_blobs (if values=4 not >4, they stay as-is, but expected recoloring suggests they should be blobs—possible subtlety: input may use 5+ for orange, but output shows 4's untouched, meaning no recoloring happened, wrong if they match a hole mapping).
 * Upper grid is all 0's except the spurious 1's column, implying no legends/blobs detected in top (possibly correct if test has isolated elements), but the unchanged 4's in bottom suggest failure to identify them as recolorable blobs (e.g., if they are connected but hole count doesn't match, should be 0's, not left as 4's—output has them as 4's with some 0's inside, indicating no processing).
 * Overall, test output makes little sense: Spurious 1's column is an artifact (likely false positive component), and lack of recoloring on bottom 4's/0's mix means blobs weren't processed or mapped (expected probably to color bottom blobs to a legend color like 1-3 based on holes, but instead partial original values remain); this highlights a bug in threshold (>4) or hole computation for test's topology.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with legend shapes (small connected components of colors 1-4 that span exactly 3 rows in height) and larger blob shapes (connected regions to be colored). The goal is to color each blob uniformly using the color from the h-th legend (sorted by position), where h is the number of enclosed holes (isolated connected 0-regions inside the blob, treating the blob as a barrier), if h is less than the number of legends; otherwise, clear the blob to 0.

 * Legends are connected components of the same color (1-4) with a bounding box height exactly 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); they are not necessarily vertical bars but any connected shape spanning exactly 3 rows vertically; only these are collected and sorted by (min_r, min_c) for indexing.
 * Blobs are connected components of cells >4 (using 4-directional connectivity); the program assumes unknowns are marked >4, but this misses cases where blobs use colors 1-4 (e.g., test uses 4 for the blob).
 * Hole counting treats blob cells as barriers: flood-fill from grid borders through non-barrier (non-blob) cells to mark exterior space (including 0s and other non-blobs); then, each separate connected component of unvisited 0s inside the barriers counts as one hole (not per cell, but per enclosed region).
 * Output starts as a copy of input; only blobs are modified (colored or cleared); legends and other cells (e.g., tall components of 1-4, background 0s) remain unchanged.
 * Subtle: Legends must be exactly height 3; taller or shorter connected 1-4 components (like the test's full-height 1 column or 11-row 4 blob) are ignored as legends and not treated as blobs if <=4, leaving them unchanged—which can produce incorrect outputs if such components are meant to be the blobs.
 * Subtle: Hole flood-fill starts only from border cells (top/bottom rows fully, left/right columns); interior non-0 non-blobs might affect enclosure if not handled, but code marks all reachable non-barrier from borders.
 * Subtle: If no legends (len(legends)==0), all blobs get h < 0 false, so cleared to 0 regardless of holes.
 * Subtle: Multiple blobs are processed independently; each gets its own hole count relative to global legends list.
 * Consideration: Grid is rectangular (e.g., 30x30 in test); assumes uniform size; 0 is background/empty, but only 0s count as potential holes (non-0 interiors don't count as holes).
 * Consideration: Connected components use BFS (deque stack, but popleft makes it BFS); 4 directions (orthogonal, no diagonals).
 * Easy to miss: The test blob (4s) encloses holes (e.g., the 0s in column 27, rows 18,20,etc., might form enclosed regions if treated as blob); visually, the 4 pattern looks like stacked "E" or bars with gaps, likely having 1+ holes per section, but code doesn't process it.
 * Easy to miss: If blobs touch borders, their "interior" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0.
 * Across attempts: Only this one attempt shown; assumes prior ones led here, but focuses on >4 blobs working for training but failing when blobs reuse 1-4 colors.

    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Extracts and sorts height-3 connected components of 1-4; returns list of dicts with 'color', 'min_r', 'min_c', 'cells'; useful but misses non-height-3 1-4 as potential blobs.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Flood-fills connected >4 components; returns list of dicts with 'cells'; helpful for >4 cases but broken for test—ignores <=4 non-legends; suggest generalizing to connected non-0 non-legends.)

```python
def count_holes(grid: List[List[int]], component_cells: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Flood-fills exterior from borders treating component as barriers, then counts connected 0-components in interior; accurate for enclosure but assumes 0s only for holes and component fully encloses; helpful and correct in logic, but depends on correct blob detection.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Orchestrates: copy, find legends, find blobs, color each blob based on holes vs. legends index; works end-to-end for >4 blobs but fails when blobs are <=4.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identified and colored blobs in training examples 1 and 2, where blobs were likely marked >4 and hole counts matched legend indexing properly.
 * Failed to detect the test blob (connected 4s, height 11) as it uses color 4 (<=4 and not height 3), so treated as neither legend nor blob—left unchanged as 4s, producing output with uncolored blob structure.
 * The tall vertical 1s (height 30) were not detected as legend (height !=3) and not blob (<=4), so left as 1s—likely correct if it's a non-colorable element, but unclear without expected output.
 * No legends detected in test (only height-3 qualify, and neither 1s nor 4s match), so even if blobs were found, they'd clear to 0; but since no blobs, nothing changes.
 * find_blobs is helpful for >4 but broken/not general for test (misses 1-4 blobs); don't use as-is—extend to connected components excluding height-3 legends.
 * count_holes is essential and correct for hole logic, but unhelpful without proper blob extraction.
 * find_legends is essential for color keys but too narrow (only height==3); misses if test has no such legends.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond narrow blob detection; copy_grid and component finding (BFS) are solid tools to reuse.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it retains the full input structure—a vertical column of 1s (column 24, all 30 rows) and a connected blob of 4s (columns 26-28, rows 17-27, forming a pattern with internal 0s like stacked bars/gaps)—without any coloring or clearing of the 4 blob, suggesting no blobs were detected or processed.
 * Expected: The 4 structure should be treated as a blob, its internal 0s (e.g., isolated in column 27) counted as holes (likely 5-6 separate hole regions from the pattern), then colored uniformly to a legend color (but no legends found, so probably cleared to 0) or perhaps to 1 if the tall 1s are misinterpreted; the output keeping 4s means the blob wasn't handled, leaving visible "unknown" regions.
 * The vertical 1s remain, which might be correct (not a blob/legend), but the overall output looks like an unchanged input with no puzzle resolution—blobs should be resolved to 1-4 or 0.
 * No >4 visible, confirming blob detection failed; the pattern suggests 1-2 holes per "E"-like section (gaps enclosed if blob is barrier), but unprocessed so unknown exact h; output differs from expected by not unifying the 4s to a single color/0.
 * Make sure to account for blobs using 1-4 colors (not just >4) and potentially no height-3 legends (e.g., use tall 1s as color source?) to handle test case.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based components where small "key" shapes (connected regions of the same color 1-4 spanning exactly 3 rows) are identified, and their properties (like enclosed hole counts) are used to assign colors to larger connected components (regions of cells >=4) based on matching enclosed hole counts; unmatched large components are cleared to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be exactly 3 rows high (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3), connected via same-color (1-4) flood fill, and are sorted by their top-left position (min_r, then min_c).
 * Hole counting is not the total number of 0-cells enclosed by a component, but the number of distinct connected components of enclosed 0-cells (i.e., separate "holes" not reachable from the grid border, treating the component cells as barriers); this is computed by flooding from borders to mark reachable non-barrier cells, then counting and flooding each remaining connected group of 0 non-barrier cells.
 * Large components are connected regions of cells >=4; they are skipped (left unchanged) only if exactly 3 rows high and all cells exactly 4 (not higher); otherwise, if their hole count indexes into the list of keys (h < len(keys)), the entire component is recolored to the matching key's color; if h >= len(keys), set to 0.
 * Components with values <=4 (but not exactly 3-high all-4) are not treated as "large" since flood_fill_ge4 only includes >=4; low-value components (<=3) are ignored for recoloring unless they form keys.
 * Border flooding for holes must avoid barriers (the component cells) and only considers 0-cells as potential holes; non-0 non-barrier cells (e.g., other colors) are treated as reachable but not counted as holes.
 * Vertical or irregular shapes may lead to miscomputed heights or connections; ensure flood fills respect exact connectivity (4-directional).
 * If no keys exist or hole counts exceed available keys, large components default to 0, potentially clearing much of the grid.
 * Subtle: In hole counting, the initial border enqueue includes only non-barrier border cells, and the hole scan only increments for unvisited 0 non-barrier cells, ensuring enclosed 0-components are counted separately even if adjacent but separated by barriers elsewhere.
 * Potential miss: Keys' own holes are computed similarly, but since keys are small (3-high), they may enclose 0 or few hole components; large components' holes can be more complex due to size.
 * Ensure grid copying preserves original for output; visited marks prevent reprocessing.

    return keys
```
(Essential for extracting and sorting key components; filters to 3-high same-color 1-4 regions and computes their holes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; training examples 1 and 2 both passed correctly, indicating the core logic (key extraction, hole counting as connected components, and large component recoloring) works for those cases.
 * The skipping condition for 3-high all-4 components (not recoloring them) worked for training but may be a subtlety—perhaps all-4 regions are "special" or pre-colored keys/large blobs that should remain.
 * Hole counting as number of connected 0-components (not total 0-cells) appears correct since training passed; total cells might be an easy miss.
 * find_keys correctly ignores non-3-high or >4 color components for keys.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the all_low check (all <=4 in ge4 flood) is tautological for ==4 but ensures skipping pure-4 3-high; if this is wrong for test, it could leave unintended regions unchanged.
 * Potential issue: If input has only low-value keys (like the vertical 1s) and no large >=4 components, output remains mostly unchanged (e.g., just the keys visible).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 30x30 grid (inferred from list lengths) that is entirely 0s except for a single vertical column of 1s (at index 24 in each of the 30 rows), resulting in a thin, unbroken line of 1s spanning the full height.
 * This does not look correct for a typical puzzle output, as it suggests minimal processing: likely the input contained these 1s as a connected key component (possibly 3-high segments or full-height, but treated as keys), with the rest as 0s or <4, and no large >=4 components to recolor—leading to an output that is essentially the input unchanged except possibly clearing non-matching areas to 0.
 * Expected output should likely include recolored large regions (e.g., filled areas with colors 1-4 based on holes matching keys), not just an isolated vertical line; the all-0 background with only 1s indicates either no large components in input or a bug in detecting/recoloring them (e.g., if the line is not exactly 3-high per key or holes don't match).
 * Difference from expected: No evidence of hole-based coloring or component filling; if test input has enclosed 0-regions or >=4 blobs, they should appear colored, but here everything else is 0—suggests the program cleared too much or missed components (unknown why, possibly input lacks >=4 or height condition fails broadly).
 * To handle test: Ensure large components aren't skipped incorrectly (e.g., revise skipping only for exact all-4 3-high); verify if vertical keys are split into 3-high segments for multiple keys.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent "heights" or colors; low-height connected components (values 1-4) act as a "key" by associating their colors with the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") they create, and high-height connected blobs (values >4) are then recolored to match the key color corresponding to the number of holes they similarly enclose, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components are strictly same-value connected groups (4-directional adjacency) for values 1-4; high blobs are any connected >4 cells (regardless of exact value).
 * Holes are the number of distinct connected components of 0-cells that are fully enclosed (not reachable from the grid border via other 0-cells or non-barrier spaces); the component itself acts as a barrier during hole counting.
 * Low components are sorted by descending size, then ascending min_row, then ascending min_col (prioritizing largest, then topmost-leftmost) before building the hole-to-color mapping; only the first (highest-priority) low component per unique hole count is used in the mapping—duplicates are ignored.
 * If a high blob's hole count has no mapping, it defaults to 0 (erased); low components and 0s are never modified.
 * Border flooding in hole counting starts from all border non-barrier cells (including 0s and other non-component cells) to mark all reachable space; enclosed holes are then detected as separate connected 0-components in the unmarked interior.
 * Subtlety: Hole count is per connected 0-region (not total 0-cells), so a large empty area counts as 1 hole if connected.
 * Subtlety: Barriers for hole counting are only the cells of the current component being analyzed—other grid cells (including other components or high/low values) are traversable unless they are the barrier.
 * Subtlety: The grid may have "divider" lines or vertical/horizontal 1s (as seen in test), which could be low components themselves; ensure flood fill doesn't cross value boundaries for low comps.
 * All components must be processed in order, but mapping is global (one per hole count across all low comps).
 * 0s are empty space only for hole detection; they don't form components.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 30x30 in test), so all functions must be dimension-agnostic.

(Extracts all low components with metadata; uses flood_fill_same and count_holes. Helpful for building the key mapping; includes size/position for sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; no prior iterations shown.
 * Successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely correctly (full match to expected outputs).
 * For test input, the program correctly identified and left low components (1-4) unchanged, as per rules.
 * Sorting low components by (size desc, min_r asc, min_c asc) and taking first unique hole-to-color mapping worked for training, ensuring consistent key assignment.
 * Hole counting via border flood + enclosed 0-component detection is accurate and handled training cases without issues (no over/under-counting of holes).
 * High blob processing (flood fill any >4, count holes, map to color or 0) was not triggered in test (or mapped to existing low colors), as output shows only 0/1/4.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt—all provided (e.g., flood_fill_same, count_holes) are relevant, correct, and essential; avoid reinventing without need.
 * Potential subtlety missed in general: If test had >4 cells, they should appear as 1-4 or 0 in output based on holes; the code handles this but test output suggests no >4 or all mapped to 1 (e.g., the vertical 1-line and left shapes remain 1s, right 4-shapes remain 4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid with mostly 0s, scattered 1s forming shapes on the left/top (e.g., possible letters/numbers in rows 0-3, 7-14, 17-18) and a vertical line of 1s in column 24 across all rows, plus a complex shape of 4s in the bottom-right (rows 17-29, columns 25-29, forming irregular connected regions with internal 0s).
 * It makes sense as output: Low components (1s and 4s) are unchanged, 0s intact; if test input had >4 cells (e.g., in the right shape or elsewhere), they were correctly replaced (possibly to 1, explaining the 1-line if it was high-mapped). No >4 remains, as expected.
 * However, without the raw test input grid or expected output, it's unclear if mappings were applied correctly (e.g., did the 4-shape enclose holes matching a 1-key? Why not recolored?). The vertical 1-line looks like a persistent low component or mapped high, but the overall structure (left shapes as 1s, right as 4s) suggests correct non-modification of lows. It looks plausible/correct based on rules, but the right 4-shape's internal 0s (visible in rows 20-29) imply it could enclose holes—if it's low (4<=4), holes aren't used for it, but if input had >4 there, output should have recolored based on those holes (e.g., to 1 if mapping[hole_count]=1). Difference: Output retains 4s, which would be wrong if those were high >4 in input (expected recolor to key color); unknown without input, but code would handle it correctly per training success.
 * No obvious errors (e.g., no stray >4, no modified lows), so it aligns with expectations; subtle issue if test has high in 4-positions but output didn't map (but code looks fine).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:56:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where small, pre-colored components using low numbers (1-4) act as "keys" that indicate a specific number of enclosed empty spaces (holes, i.e., regions of 0s fully surrounded by the component and not connected to the grid border), and larger components made of high numbers (>4) must be recolored to match the color of the low key that has the same number of holes as the high component encloses. The goal is to process the input grid, identify and analyze low components to build a mapping from hole counts to colors, then apply that mapping to recolor high components while leaving low components (1-4) and empty space (0) unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components (1-4) are connected groups of the same color; they are not recolored and serve only as keys—each is analyzed for its own enclosed holes (counting isolated 0-regions inside it, via flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space).
 * High components (>4) are connected groups of cells >4; they are recolored based on the hole count they enclose (similar flood-fill for holes), mapping to the color of a matching low key; if no match, default to 0.
 * Hole counting is tricky: it requires treating the component as a barrier, flood-filling from all border cells (edges of the grid) through non-barrier, non-visited 0s to mark "exterior" space; any remaining unvisited 0s inside are holes, but only count isolated 0-components (not single cells necessarily, but full connected 0-regions fully enclosed).
 * Mapping from holes to color: not all low components with the same hole count are equivalent; the code sorts low components by size descending, then min_r ascending, then min_c ascending, and takes the first (largest/top-left) for each unique hole count— this may be incorrect if the puzzle intends positional matching, shape similarity, or another tiebreaker (e.g., color order or exact position relative to high components).
 * Grid is 30x30 (inferred from outputs), with many 0s; components don't wrap around edges; directions are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Subtle: In count_holes, the initial flood-fill from borders marks exterior 0s, but the hole counting loop then iterates all cells and flood-fills remaining 0s, incrementing hole_count per such isolated 0-component (not per cell, which the code does correctly via inner while loop).
 * Easy to miss: High components might enclose holes that include low components or other highs? But code treats all non-barrier as traversable for exterior fill, and only counts enclosed 0s as holes—lows (1-4) are not 0s, so they block or are ignored in hole counting; ensure visited prevents recounting.
 * Another subtlety: If multiple low components have the same hole count, the mapping overwrites with the last one in sorted order (code uses if h not in mapping, so first in sorted list wins); this caused mismatches in examples where expected uses a different low color for the same holes.
 * Components must be 4-connected; flood_fill uses BFS with stack=deque popleft.
 * 0s on borders are always exterior; fully internal 0s only count as holes if enclosed by the specific component being analyzed (isolated from borders via that barrier).
 * Low components might have holes themselves, which defines their key value; high components' holes are computed similarly but relative to their own shape.
 * Potential edge case: Components touching borders have no "enclosed" holes from border 0s; zero-hole highs might map to a low with zero holes, or default 0.
 * Copy_grid preserves input for output; only modify high cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for creating a modifiable output grid without altering input.)

```python
def flood_fill_low(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # BFS to find connected component of exact color (1-4); returns cells if matching, else [].
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    if g[sr][sc] != color:
        return []
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    cells = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.popleft()
        if g[x][y] != color:
            continue
        cells.append((x, y))
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(Helpful for extracting low components accurately.)

```python

```
(This is mostly helpful for hole counting, but subtle bug: initial border flood doesn't restrict to 0s—it floods through any non-barrier cells (e.g., other lows or highs), which might incorrectly mark internal non-0s as exterior; should probably only flood through 0s for exterior, and ensure holes only count 0s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly identifies and extracts low/high components via flood-fill and computes holes for them.
 * What worked: Low components are found and sorted; mapping is built per unique hole count; highs are recolored only if mapping exists; output preserves lows and 0s.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, a high component (likely in rows 8-16, cols 9-12, shaped like a blob with holes) is colored 1 instead of expected 4—probably because multiple lows have the same hole count, and sorting by size/min_r/min_c picked the wrong (smaller or lower-positioned) low as the key; e.g., a size-3 '1' component overrode a size-? '4' with matching holes.
 * In training example 1, another high (rows 26-29, cols 17-20) is colored 1 but expected 4—same mapping issue, where expected uses '4' keys for these hole counts, suggesting tiebreaker should prioritize color value, position near the high, or reverse sorting.
 * In training example 2, highs in rows 1-7 cols 18-29 are colored 1 but expected 2—again, mapping picked wrong low (likely a '1' with matching holes over a '2'); another high in rows 9-16 cols 20-29 stays 3? but expected has 3s there? Wait, 3 is low, but output shows some recoloring to 1 where expected 2.
 * Sorting low_comps by (-size, min_r, min_c) works for prioritizing large/top-left, but fails when puzzle expects smallest/bottom-right or color-based priority (e.g., higher color number wins).
 * count_holes seems to overcount or mis-mark exterior if it floods non-0s; in ex1, this might lead to wrong hole counts for lows, causing bad mapping.
 * find_low_components correctly skips 0 and >4, but doesn't handle if lows touch highs.
 * Overall, partial understanding: component extraction and basic mapping work, but tiebreaking for duplicate hole counts and potential flood-fill traversal (through non-0s) break it.
 * No prior attempts, but this one shows the approach is close but needs mapping refinement (e.g., sort by color desc instead of size? or per-high position-based matching).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-relies on color 1 for many high components (e.g., rows 0-7 cols 9-11 and 24-25 are 1s, rows 8-14 cols 0-2 and 8-11 are 1s, rows 17-29 col 24 are all 1s), while leaving some 4-patterns unchanged (rows 17-29 cols 26-28), suggesting the mapping heavily favors '1' keys due to sorting picking them for common hole counts.
 * Expected test output is unknown (no expected provided), but based on training patterns, it likely needs more varied colors (e.g., 2,3,4 for different highs); the uniform 1s indicate same mapping flaw as training—probably all highs have 0-1 holes, mapped to a single '1' low.
 * The 4s in rows 17-29 cols 26-28 remain (as they are <=4, lows are preserved), but surrounding highs are 1s where they might expect 4 or other; a complex high blob in rows 19-29 cols 9-28 (with internal 0s and 4-patterns) is partially 1 and partially unchanged 4/0, but looks like it encloses multiple holes, so should be a single color—output fragments it incorrectly.
 * Hole counting likely wrong for this test's irregular shapes (e.g., the bottom high has protrusions and internal 4s, which might be treated as barriers or not, leading to under/over-count); output doesn't unify the large bottom structure into one color.
 * Test makes partial sense (recolors some highs to 1, keeps lows), but fails to vary colors, suggesting broken mapping/tiebreaker; without input grid, hard to verify exact holes, but differences from training imply same issue.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:56:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where small, pre-colored components using low numbers (1-4) act as "keys" that indicate a specific number of enclosed empty spaces (holes, i.e., regions of 0s fully surrounded by the component and not connected to the grid border), and larger components made of high numbers (>4) must be recolored to match the color of the low key that has the same number of holes as the high component encloses. The goal is to process the input grid, identify and analyze low components to build a mapping from hole counts to colors, then apply that mapping to recolor high components while leaving low components (1-4) and empty space (0) unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components (1-4) are connected groups of the same color; they are not recolored and serve only as keys—each is analyzed for its own enclosed holes (counting isolated 0-regions inside it, via flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space).
 * High components (>4) are connected groups of cells >4; they are recolored based on the hole count they enclose (similar flood-fill for holes), mapping to the color of a matching low key; if no match, default to 0.
 * Hole counting is tricky: it requires treating the component as a barrier, flood-filling from all border cells (edges of the grid) through non-barrier, non-visited 0s to mark "exterior" space; any remaining unvisited 0s inside are holes, but only count isolated 0-components (not single cells necessarily, but full connected 0-regions fully enclosed).
 * Mapping from holes to color: not all low components with the same hole count are equivalent; the code sorts low components by size descending, then min_r ascending, then min_c ascending, and takes the first (largest/top-left) for each unique hole count— this may be incorrect if the puzzle intends positional matching, shape similarity, or another tiebreaker (e.g., color order or exact position relative to high components).
 * Grid is 30x30 (inferred from outputs), with many 0s; components don't wrap around edges; directions are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Subtle: In count_holes, the initial flood-fill from borders marks exterior 0s, but the hole counting loop then iterates all cells and flood-fills remaining 0s, incrementing hole_count per such isolated 0-component (not per cell, which the code does correctly via inner while loop).
 * Easy to miss: High components might enclose holes that include low components or other highs? But code treats all non-barrier as traversable for exterior fill, and only counts enclosed 0s as holes—lows (1-4) are not 0s, so they block or are ignored in hole counting; ensure visited prevents recounting.
 * Another subtlety: If multiple low components have the same hole count, the mapping overwrites with the last one in sorted order (code uses if h not in mapping, so first in sorted list wins); this caused mismatches in examples where expected uses a different low color for the same holes.
 * Components must be 4-connected; flood_fill uses BFS with stack=deque popleft.
 * 0s on borders are always exterior; fully internal 0s only count as holes if enclosed by the specific component being analyzed (isolated from borders via that barrier).
 * Low components might have holes themselves, which defines their key value; high components' holes are computed similarly but relative to their own shape.
 * Potential edge case: Components touching borders have no "enclosed" holes from border 0s; zero-hole highs might map to a low with zero holes, or default 0.
 * Copy_grid preserves input for output; only modify high cells.

(This is mostly helpful for hole counting, but subtle bug: initial border flood doesn't restrict to 0s—it floods through any non-barrier cells (e.g., other lows or highs), which might incorrectly mark internal non-0s as exterior; should probably only flood through 0s for exterior, and ensure holes only count 0s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly identifies and extracts low/high components via flood-fill and computes holes for them.
 * What worked: Low components are found and sorted; mapping is built per unique hole count; highs are recolored only if mapping exists; output preserves lows and 0s.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, a high component (likely in rows 8-16, cols 9-12, shaped like a blob with holes) is colored 1 instead of expected 4—probably because multiple lows have the same hole count, and sorting by size/min_r/min_c picked the wrong (smaller or lower-positioned) low as the key; e.g., a size-3 '1' component overrode a size-? '4' with matching holes.
 * In training example 1, another high (rows 26-29, cols 17-20) is colored 1 but expected 4—same mapping issue, where expected uses '4' keys for these hole counts, suggesting tiebreaker should prioritize color value, position near the high, or reverse sorting.
 * In training example 2, highs in rows 1-7 cols 18-29 are colored 1 but expected 2—again, mapping picked wrong low (likely a '1' with matching holes over a '2'); another high in rows 9-16 cols 20-29 stays 3? but expected has 3s there? Wait, 3 is low, but output shows some recoloring to 1 where expected 2.
 * Sorting low_comps by (-size, min_r, min_c) works for prioritizing large/top-left, but fails when puzzle expects smallest/bottom-right or color-based priority (e.g., higher color number wins).
 * count_holes seems to overcount or mis-mark exterior if it floods non-0s; in ex1, this might lead to wrong hole counts for lows, causing bad mapping.
 * find_low_components correctly skips 0 and >4, but doesn't handle if lows touch highs.
 * Overall, partial understanding: component extraction and basic mapping work, but tiebreaking for duplicate hole counts and potential flood-fill traversal (through non-0s) break it.
 * No prior attempts, but this one shows the approach is close but needs mapping refinement (e.g., sort by color desc instead of size? or per-high position-based matching).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-relies on color 1 for many high components (e.g., rows 0-7 cols 9-11 and 24-25 are 1s, rows 8-14 cols 0-2 and 8-11 are 1s, rows 17-29 col 24 are all 1s), while leaving some 4-patterns unchanged (rows 17-29 cols 26-28), suggesting the mapping heavily favors '1' keys due to sorting picking them for common hole counts.
 * Expected test output is unknown (no expected provided), but based on training patterns, it likely needs more varied colors (e.g., 2,3,4 for different highs); the uniform 1s indicate same mapping flaw as training—probably all highs have 0-1 holes, mapped to a single '1' low.
 * The 4s in rows 17-29 cols 26-28 remain (as they are <=4, lows are preserved), but surrounding highs are 1s where they might expect 4 or other; a complex high blob in rows 19-29 cols 9-28 (with internal 0s and 4-patterns) is partially 1 and partially unchanged 4/0, but looks like it encloses multiple holes, so should be a single color—output fragments it incorrectly.
 * Hole counting likely wrong for this test's irregular shapes (e.g., the bottom high has protrusions and internal 4s, which might be treated as barriers or not, leading to under/over-count); output doesn't unify the large bottom structure into one color.
 * Test makes partial sense (recolors some highs to 1, keeps lows), but fails to vary colors, suggesting broken mapping/tiebreaker; without input grid, hard to verify exact holes, but differences from training imply same issue.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful for safe grid manipulation.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Perform flood fill to find connected component of cells >4 using 4-connectivity."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    blob = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.popleft()
        if visited[r][c]:
            continue
        visited[r][c] = True
        if g[r][c] <= 4:
            continue
        blob.append((r, c))
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] > 4:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return blob
```
(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components where small "key" shapes (colored 1-4, exactly 3 rows high) encode color mappings via the number of enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the border), and larger "orange" blobs (high values, potentially including 4) are recolored to match the key color associated with their own enclosed hole count, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be connected components of the same color (1-4) with exact height 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); taller or shorter components are ignored, even if they visually resemble keys (e.g., a full-height vertical line of 1's is one component of height 30, not multiple keys).
 * Holes are strictly internal 0's disconnected from the grid border; the count_holes function uses BFS from border non-barrier cells to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unmarked 0's inside the shape—subtlety: barriers are only the component cells themselves, so adjacent 0's outside the component but enclosed by it count as holes if not border-connected.
 * Multiple keys with the same hole count: select the "best" (smallest min_r, then smallest min_c) to map hole count to a single color; if no key for a blob's hole count, set blob to 0.
 * Blobs are connected components of high values (code assumes >4 for "orange"), but subtlety: in the test case, values are exactly 4, suggesting blobs may include ==4; unconnected or isolated high cells aren't blobs.
 * Grid is copied before modification to avoid altering input; directions for connectivity are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical or irregular key shapes may span height >3 if connected, breaking key detection; hole counting ignores the blob/key color value (treats as barrier) but requires grid[r][c]==0 for internal cells; border enqueue in count_holes has redundancy (corners enqueued twice) but works; if no components, output is unchanged copy.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes fixed height=3 for keys (may not generalize if keys vary); blob detection misses ==4; no handling for keys/blobs overlapping or touching borders in ways that affect hole counting; potential for 0-hole keys to map blobs with 0 enclosures.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (both passed, likely due to keys being height 3 and blobs >4).
 * Missed detecting keys in test case: vertical line of 1's forms single component height ~30 !=3, so no key_components found, no hole-to-color mapping created.
 * find_orange_blobs is broken for test case: searches for >4, but test has patterns of exactly 4, so no blobs processed; output is effectively unchanged copy of input (1's and 4's remain, rest 0's).
 * count_holes and find_key_components are helpful and correct for their logic, but unused in test due to upstream failures.
 * No prior attempts to note, but this attempt assumes fixed blob threshold >4 (not general); height==3 is rigid and misses tall keys; mapping uses min position for ties (worked in training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a full vertical column of 1's (column index 24, all rows), unchanged, and repeating patterns of 4's in rows 17-28 (columns 26-28, forming what looks like 6 vertical "E"-like or barred shapes, each 3 rows high with internal 0's), also unchanged, surrounded by 0's everywhere else.
 * This does not look correct: No recoloring occurred, suggesting the program failed to identify the 4-patterns as blobs (because ==4, not >4) or find matching keys (1's too tall for height==3 check); expected output should recolor the 4-blobs to some color 1-4 based on their enclosed holes matching a key's holes, or to 0, but instead it's static—likely the vertical 1's are meant as multiple stacked keys or a different detection rule, and 4's are the target blobs; difference is total lack of modification, which mismatches puzzle goal of transforming blobs via keys (unknown exact expected colors, but output should differ visibly in the 4 areas).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where "legend" shapes (connected components of colors 1-4 that are rectangular/large enough) define a mapping from the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") within them to their color. Orange blobs (connected regions of values >4) are then recolored based on matching their own hole count to this mapping, or set to 0 if no match, effectively classifying unknown orange shapes by their topological similarity (hole count) to known legends.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are only valid connected components (4-directional adjacency) of the same color from 1-4 that span more than one row and one column (height >1 and width >1), excluding single cells or lines.
 * Holes are fully enclosed regions of 0's (background) that are not connected to the grid border; the count_holes function correctly implements a flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unvisited 0's as distinct holes.
 * Mapping from hole count to color takes the first encountered legend for each unique hole count (sorted by position), so order matters and duplicates aren't handled—could overwrite if not careful, but code avoids it by checking "if h not in mapping".
 * Orange blobs (>4, connected 4-directionally) are recolored entirely to the mapped color if their hole count matches a legend's, or to 0 otherwise; non-orange regions (0-4) remain unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Hole counting treats the component's cells as barriers, but only counts enclosed 0's—other colors inside aren't considered holes, and the flood-fill ensures only truly enclosed areas are counted.
 * Grid is 30x30 based on outputs; assumes rectangular grid with no wrapping.
 * Potential miss: If a legend or blob touches the border, its "holes" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0; also, diagonal connections don't count (only orthogonal).
 * In mapping, only legends contribute; single-color lines or small shapes aren't legends, so ignored.
 * For blobs, if hole count doesn't match any legend, set to 0 (erasing the orange), which might be a way to "remove" unmatched unknowns.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of legends by (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent mapping order, preventing position-based variability.

(Combines legends and hole counting into mapping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission provided; it correctly solved training example 1, indicating solid understanding of legend extraction, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output colored the large central shape (around rows 2-6, cols 13-23) entirely as 1's, but expected 2's; also left some small areas (e.g., row 1 cols 18-19 as 1's instead of 2's, row 9 cols 10-12 as 1's instead of 2's) mismatched, and bottom orange blobs (rows 19-29, various cols) have partial recoloring (some 3's remain or are wrong, e.g., row 20 cols 20-21 as 3's but expected partial 3's with 2's nearby? Wait, differences are scattered—e.g., row 9 col 10-12: generated 1's vs expected 2's; row 15 col 21-22: generated 3's vs expected 0's? Unknown exact cause, but likely miscomputed hole count for the central blob or wrong legend mapping due to multiple legends with overlapping hole counts).
 * What worked: Legend detection and basic BFS for components/holes seems robust (passed train1); mapping logic applies correctly when hole counts are unique/simple.
 * What didn't: In train2, the central blob was treated as having a hole count matching color 1's legend instead of 2's, suggesting either wrong hole count (e.g., overcounting/underCounting enclosures due to barrier setup) or mapping overwrite/selection error from sorting; also, some orange sub-blobs weren't fully recolored, leaving 3's where expected 2's or 0's.
 * count_holes is helpful and seems correct (no issues in train1), but may fail if component cells don't fully barrier internal 0's (e.g., if legend has internal non-0 but code only barriers the legend cells).
 * find_orange_blobs is helpful but in train2 didn't group all connected >4 properly, leading to partial coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided seem relevant, though get_legends wrapper is just a filter and could be inlined.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It introduces a vertical column of 1's (column 24, rows 0-29) where the input likely had 0's or empty space, suggesting erroneous detection of a "legend" or blob there (possibly misreading a thin vertical structure as a legend with holes mapping to 1, or a bug in component finding treating border/empty as component).
 * The bottom orange regions (rows 18-29, cols 25-28 with 4's, likely >4 in input but shown as 4's—wait, code treats >4 as orange, but output leaves most 4's unchanged, indicating either input has exactly 4 (treated as legend, not blob) or bug in find_orange_blobs (if values=4 not >4, they stay as-is, but expected recoloring suggests they should be blobs—possible subtlety: input may use 5+ for orange, but output shows 4's untouched, meaning no recoloring happened, wrong if they match a hole mapping).
 * Upper grid is all 0's except the spurious 1's column, implying no legends/blobs detected in top (possibly correct if test has isolated elements), but the unchanged 4's in bottom suggest failure to identify them as recolorable blobs (e.g., if they are connected but hole count doesn't match, should be 0's, not left as 4's—output has them as 4's with some 0's inside, indicating no processing).
 * Overall, test output makes little sense: Spurious 1's column is an artifact (likely false positive component), and lack of recoloring on bottom 4's/0's mix means blobs weren't processed or mapped (expected probably to color bottom blobs to a legend color like 1-3 based on holes, but instead partial original values remain); this highlights a bug in threshold (>4) or hole computation for test's topology.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with legend shapes (small connected components of colors 1-4 that span exactly 3 rows in height) and larger blob shapes (connected regions to be colored). The goal is to color each blob uniformly using the color from the h-th legend (sorted by position), where h is the number of enclosed holes (isolated connected 0-regions inside the blob, treating the blob as a barrier), if h is less than the number of legends; otherwise, clear the blob to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are connected components of the same color (1-4) with a bounding box height exactly 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); they are not necessarily vertical bars but any connected shape spanning exactly 3 rows vertically; only these are collected and sorted by (min_r, min_c) for indexing.
 * Blobs are connected components of cells >4 (using 4-directional connectivity); the program assumes unknowns are marked >4, but this misses cases where blobs use colors 1-4 (e.g., test uses 4 for the blob).
 * Hole counting treats blob cells as barriers: flood-fill from grid borders through non-barrier (non-blob) cells to mark exterior space (including 0s and other non-blobs); then, each separate connected component of unvisited 0s inside the barriers counts as one hole (not per cell, but per enclosed region).
 * Output starts as a copy of input; only blobs are modified (colored or cleared); legends and other cells (e.g., tall components of 1-4, background 0s) remain unchanged.
 * Subtle: Legends must be exactly height 3; taller or shorter connected 1-4 components (like the test's full-height 1 column or 11-row 4 blob) are ignored as legends and not treated as blobs if <=4, leaving them unchanged—which can produce incorrect outputs if such components are meant to be the blobs.
 * Subtle: Hole flood-fill starts only from border cells (top/bottom rows fully, left/right columns); interior non-0 non-blobs might affect enclosure if not handled, but code marks all reachable non-barrier from borders.
 * Subtle: If no legends (len(legends)==0), all blobs get h < 0 false, so cleared to 0 regardless of holes.
 * Subtle: Multiple blobs are processed independently; each gets its own hole count relative to global legends list.
 * Consideration: Grid is rectangular (e.g., 30x30 in test); assumes uniform size; 0 is background/empty, but only 0s count as potential holes (non-0 interiors don't count as holes).
 * Consideration: Connected components use BFS (deque stack, but popleft makes it BFS); 4 directions (orthogonal, no diagonals).
 * Easy to miss: The test blob (4s) encloses holes (e.g., the 0s in column 27, rows 18,20,etc., might form enclosed regions if treated as blob); visually, the 4 pattern looks like stacked "E" or bars with gaps, likely having 1+ holes per section, but code doesn't process it.
 * Easy to miss: If blobs touch borders, their "interior" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0.
 * Across attempts: Only this one attempt shown; assumes prior ones led here, but focuses on >4 blobs working for training but failing when blobs reuse 1-4 colors.

    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Orchestrates: copy, find legends, find blobs, color each blob based on holes vs. legends index; works end-to-end for >4 blobs but fails when blobs are <=4.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identified and colored blobs in training examples 1 and 2, where blobs were likely marked >4 and hole counts matched legend indexing properly.
 * Failed to detect the test blob (connected 4s, height 11) as it uses color 4 (<=4 and not height 3), so treated as neither legend nor blob—left unchanged as 4s, producing output with uncolored blob structure.
 * The tall vertical 1s (height 30) were not detected as legend (height !=3) and not blob (<=4), so left as 1s—likely correct if it's a non-colorable element, but unclear without expected output.
 * No legends detected in test (only height-3 qualify, and neither 1s nor 4s match), so even if blobs were found, they'd clear to 0; but since no blobs, nothing changes.
 * find_blobs is helpful for >4 but broken/not general for test (misses 1-4 blobs); don't use as-is—extend to connected components excluding height-3 legends.
 * count_holes is essential and correct for hole logic, but unhelpful without proper blob extraction.
 * find_legends is essential for color keys but too narrow (only height==3); misses if test has no such legends.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond narrow blob detection; copy_grid and component finding (BFS) are solid tools to reuse.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it retains the full input structure—a vertical column of 1s (column 24, all 30 rows) and a connected blob of 4s (columns 26-28, rows 17-27, forming a pattern with internal 0s like stacked bars/gaps)—without any coloring or clearing of the 4 blob, suggesting no blobs were detected or processed.
 * Expected: The 4 structure should be treated as a blob, its internal 0s (e.g., isolated in column 27) counted as holes (likely 5-6 separate hole regions from the pattern), then colored uniformly to a legend color (but no legends found, so probably cleared to 0) or perhaps to 1 if the tall 1s are misinterpreted; the output keeping 4s means the blob wasn't handled, leaving visible "unknown" regions.
 * The vertical 1s remain, which might be correct (not a blob/legend), but the overall output looks like an unchanged input with no puzzle resolution—blobs should be resolved to 1-4 or 0.
 * No >4 visible, confirming blob detection failed; the pattern suggests 1-2 holes per "E"-like section (gaps enclosed if blob is barrier), but unprocessed so unknown exact h; output differs from expected by not unifying the 4s to a single color/0.
 * Make sure to account for blobs using 1-4 colors (not just >4) and potentially no height-3 legends (e.g., use tall 1s as color source?) to handle test case.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based components where small "key" shapes (connected regions of the same color 1-4 spanning exactly 3 rows) are identified, and their properties (like enclosed hole counts) are used to assign colors to larger connected components (regions of cells >=4) based on matching enclosed hole counts; unmatched large components are cleared to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be exactly 3 rows high (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3), connected via same-color (1-4) flood fill, and are sorted by their top-left position (min_r, then min_c).
 * Hole counting is not the total number of 0-cells enclosed by a component, but the number of distinct connected components of enclosed 0-cells (i.e., separate "holes" not reachable from the grid border, treating the component cells as barriers); this is computed by flooding from borders to mark reachable non-barrier cells, then counting and flooding each remaining connected group of 0 non-barrier cells.
 * Large components are connected regions of cells >=4; they are skipped (left unchanged) only if exactly 3 rows high and all cells exactly 4 (not higher); otherwise, if their hole count indexes into the list of keys (h < len(keys)), the entire component is recolored to the matching key's color; if h >= len(keys), set to 0.
 * Components with values <=4 (but not exactly 3-high all-4) are not treated as "large" since flood_fill_ge4 only includes >=4; low-value components (<=3) are ignored for recoloring unless they form keys.
 * Border flooding for holes must avoid barriers (the component cells) and only considers 0-cells as potential holes; non-0 non-barrier cells (e.g., other colors) are treated as reachable but not counted as holes.
 * Vertical or irregular shapes may lead to miscomputed heights or connections; ensure flood fills respect exact connectivity (4-directional).
 * If no keys exist or hole counts exceed available keys, large components default to 0, potentially clearing much of the grid.
 * Subtle: In hole counting, the initial border enqueue includes only non-barrier border cells, and the hole scan only increments for unvisited 0 non-barrier cells, ensuring enclosed 0-components are counted separately even if adjacent but separated by barriers elsewhere.
 * Potential miss: Keys' own holes are computed similarly, but since keys are small (3-high), they may enclose 0 or few hole components; large components' holes can be more complex due to size.
 * Ensure grid copying preserves original for output; visited marks prevent reprocessing.

(Key function for computing number of enclosed 0-connected-components (holes); uses border flood to find unreachable areas, then counts separate 0-components in them. Works for both keys and large components.)

```python
def find_keys(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    keys = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if 1 <= g[r][c] <= 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                cells = flood_fill_same(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in cells)
                    max_r = max(rr for rr, _ in cells)

    return keys
```
(Essential for extracting and sorting key components; filters to 3-high same-color 1-4 regions and computes their holes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; training examples 1 and 2 both passed correctly, indicating the core logic (key extraction, hole counting as connected components, and large component recoloring) works for those cases.
 * The skipping condition for 3-high all-4 components (not recoloring them) worked for training but may be a subtlety—perhaps all-4 regions are "special" or pre-colored keys/large blobs that should remain.
 * Hole counting as number of connected 0-components (not total 0-cells) appears correct since training passed; total cells might be an easy miss.
 * find_keys correctly ignores non-3-high or >4 color components for keys.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the all_low check (all <=4 in ge4 flood) is tautological for ==4 but ensures skipping pure-4 3-high; if this is wrong for test, it could leave unintended regions unchanged.
 * Potential issue: If input has only low-value keys (like the vertical 1s) and no large >=4 components, output remains mostly unchanged (e.g., just the keys visible).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 30x30 grid (inferred from list lengths) that is entirely 0s except for a single vertical column of 1s (at index 24 in each of the 30 rows), resulting in a thin, unbroken line of 1s spanning the full height.
 * This does not look correct for a typical puzzle output, as it suggests minimal processing: likely the input contained these 1s as a connected key component (possibly 3-high segments or full-height, but treated as keys), with the rest as 0s or <4, and no large >=4 components to recolor—leading to an output that is essentially the input unchanged except possibly clearing non-matching areas to 0.
 * Expected output should likely include recolored large regions (e.g., filled areas with colors 1-4 based on holes matching keys), not just an isolated vertical line; the all-0 background with only 1s indicates either no large components in input or a bug in detecting/recoloring them (e.g., if the line is not exactly 3-high per key or holes don't match).
 * Difference from expected: No evidence of hole-based coloring or component filling; if test input has enclosed 0-regions or >=4 blobs, they should appear colored, but here everything else is 0—suggests the program cleared too much or missed components (unknown why, possibly input lacks >=4 or height condition fails broadly).
 * To handle test: Ensure large components aren't skipped incorrectly (e.g., revise skipping only for exact all-4 3-high); verify if vertical keys are split into 3-high segments for multiple keys.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent "heights" or colors; low-height connected components (values 1-4) act as a "key" by associating their colors with the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") they create, and high-height connected blobs (values >4) are then recolored to match the key color corresponding to the number of holes they similarly enclose, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components are strictly same-value connected groups (4-directional adjacency) for values 1-4; high blobs are any connected >4 cells (regardless of exact value).
 * Holes are the number of distinct connected components of 0-cells that are fully enclosed (not reachable from the grid border via other 0-cells or non-barrier spaces); the component itself acts as a barrier during hole counting.
 * Low components are sorted by descending size, then ascending min_row, then ascending min_col (prioritizing largest, then topmost-leftmost) before building the hole-to-color mapping; only the first (highest-priority) low component per unique hole count is used in the mapping—duplicates are ignored.
 * If a high blob's hole count has no mapping, it defaults to 0 (erased); low components and 0s are never modified.
 * Border flooding in hole counting starts from all border non-barrier cells (including 0s and other non-component cells) to mark all reachable space; enclosed holes are then detected as separate connected 0-components in the unmarked interior.
 * Subtlety: Hole count is per connected 0-region (not total 0-cells), so a large empty area counts as 1 hole if connected.
 * Subtlety: Barriers for hole counting are only the cells of the current component being analyzed—other grid cells (including other components or high/low values) are traversable unless they are the barrier.
 * Subtlety: The grid may have "divider" lines or vertical/horizontal 1s (as seen in test), which could be low components themselves; ensure flood fill doesn't cross value boundaries for low comps.
 * All components must be processed in order, but mapping is global (one per hole count across all low comps).
 * 0s are empty space only for hole detection; they don't form components.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 30x30 in test), so all functions must be dimension-agnostic.

(Core hole-counting function; treats component as barrier, floods borders to mark exterior/interior reachable space, then counts connected enclosed 0-regions. Accurate and essential; correctly handles multiple holes per component.)

```
(Extracts all low components with metadata; uses flood_fill_same and count_holes. Helpful for building the key mapping; includes size/position for sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; no prior iterations shown.
 * Successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely correctly (full match to expected outputs).
 * For test input, the program correctly identified and left low components (1-4) unchanged, as per rules.
 * Sorting low components by (size desc, min_r asc, min_c asc) and taking first unique hole-to-color mapping worked for training, ensuring consistent key assignment.
 * Hole counting via border flood + enclosed 0-component detection is accurate and handled training cases without issues (no over/under-counting of holes).
 * High blob processing (flood fill any >4, count holes, map to color or 0) was not triggered in test (or mapped to existing low colors), as output shows only 0/1/4.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt—all provided (e.g., flood_fill_same, count_holes) are relevant, correct, and essential; avoid reinventing without need.
 * Potential subtlety missed in general: If test had >4 cells, they should appear as 1-4 or 0 in output based on holes; the code handles this but test output suggests no >4 or all mapped to 1 (e.g., the vertical 1-line and left shapes remain 1s, right 4-shapes remain 4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid with mostly 0s, scattered 1s forming shapes on the left/top (e.g., possible letters/numbers in rows 0-3, 7-14, 17-18) and a vertical line of 1s in column 24 across all rows, plus a complex shape of 4s in the bottom-right (rows 17-29, columns 25-29, forming irregular connected regions with internal 0s).
 * It makes sense as output: Low components (1s and 4s) are unchanged, 0s intact; if test input had >4 cells (e.g., in the right shape or elsewhere), they were correctly replaced (possibly to 1, explaining the 1-line if it was high-mapped). No >4 remains, as expected.
 * However, without the raw test input grid or expected output, it's unclear if mappings were applied correctly (e.g., did the 4-shape enclose holes matching a 1-key? Why not recolored?). The vertical 1-line looks like a persistent low component or mapped high, but the overall structure (left shapes as 1s, right as 4s) suggests correct non-modification of lows. It looks plausible/correct based on rules, but the right 4-shape's internal 0s (visible in rows 20-29) imply it could enclose holes—if it's low (4<=4), holes aren't used for it, but if input had >4 there, output should have recolored based on those holes (e.g., to 1 if mapping[hole_count]=1). Difference: Output retains 4s, which would be wrong if those were high >4 in input (expected recolor to key color); unknown without input, but code would handle it correctly per training success.
 * No obvious errors (e.g., no stray >4, no modified lows), so it aligns with expectations; subtle issue if test has high in 4-positions but output didn't map (but code looks fine).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:57:12] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where low-value connected components (numbers 1-4, representing colored shapes) are analyzed to create a mapping from the number of enclosed holes (regions of 0s fully surrounded by the component) to a color (1-4). High-value connected components (>4, representing uncolored or placeholder shapes) are then recolored according to this mapping based on their own hole counts, effectively "solving" the puzzle by applying the learned color-hole association consistently across the grid while preserving low components and empty space (0s).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count for connectivity.
 * Holes are strictly enclosed regions of 0s that are fully surrounded by a single component's cells and cannot reach the grid border via adjacent 0s—use a flood fill from borders to mark reachable 0s as non-holes, then count remaining isolated 0-regions within the component's bounding area.
 * Low components (1-4) are never modified; only high components (>4) are recolored, and only if their hole count matches a key in the mapping (otherwise, default to 0 or leave unchanged? but examples suggest mapping to the correct color or 0).
 * Mapping creation: Hole-to-color association should be based on low components, but subtleties include prioritizing components by size (largest first), then position (top-most, then left-most) to resolve ties—do not overwrite mappings for the same hole count; take the "primary" one.
 * Grid borders are always accessible for hole detection; components touching borders cannot enclose holes on that side.
 * 0s are background/empty; they can form holes only if isolated by the component (not connected to outer space).
 * Subtle: Hole counting must treat the component as a barrier, but only count 0s inside its "interior"—avoid counting external 0s or 0s in other components.
 * Components may be irregular shapes (e.g., with bays or protrusions), so hole detection needs robust flood fill to avoid false positives (e.g., U-shapes don't enclose holes).
 * Mapping is one-way: multiple low components might have the same hole count, but only one defines the color for that hole value (based on sorting criteria); high components use this lookup.
 * Preserve all original low (1-4) and 0 cells exactly; only overwrite >4 cells.
 * Edge case: Components with 0 holes map to a color if defined; undefined hole counts for high components should map to 0 (per code, but examples suggest specific colors).
 * Subtle: In hole counting for high components, use the original grid (not modified), and barriers are only the high component's cells—low components or other highs don't block unless adjacent.
 * Grid size is consistent (30x30? from outputs), but assume variable; no wrapping around edges.

(Extracts low components and builds mapping; sorting priority seems correct based on examples, but may need validation if ties cause wrong color picks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided uses a solid structure for component finding and hole counting, correctly identifying low components and applying mapping to high ones.
 * What worked: Flood fill accurately groups same-color cells; hole counting correctly uses border flood to exclude reachable 0s and counts isolated 0-groups as separate holes; mapping avoids duplicates by checking 'if h not in mapping'.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated output assigns color 1 to a high component (rows 8-16, cols 10-12) that should be 4 (expected shows 4s there, e.g., row 8: positions 10-11 as 4,4; generated has 1,1); similarly, row 27: generated has 1s where expected has 4s. This suggests wrong mapping lookup—possibly hole count miscomputed for that high component (e.g., counted 0 holes but mapped to 1 instead of 4) or sorting picked wrong low component for holes=0 or whatever value it has.
 * In training example 1, another mismatch: row 27-30 expected has a large 4-block in cols 17+, but generated has scattered 1s (e.g., row 27: 1,1,1 at cols 17-19); this indicates the high component there was assigned 1 instead of 4, likely same mapping/hole error.
 * In training example 2, generated assigns 1 to large high components (e.g., rows 2-6, cols 14-24 should be 2 per expected, but generated has 1s in places like row 2 cols 18-19); expected has 2s there. Also, row 9 cols 10-12 generated 1,1,1 but expected 2,2,2. Hole counts likely wrong (e.g., that component has 0 holes but mapped to wrong color).
 * Overall, low components are preserved correctly in both trainings (e.g., top shapes in 1-4 unchanged), but high recoloring fails consistently, suggesting bug in count_holes for high components (perhaps barriers not isolating properly, or flooding includes low components' 0s incorrectly) or mapping not capturing all hole values (e.g., missing holes=0 or holes=1 mappings).
 * Sorting in mapping seems to prioritize correctly (largest first), but if multiple low components have same holes and sizes, min_r/min_c tiebreaker may pick wrong "representative" color.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (flood_fill_same, count_holes, etc.) are relevant and mostly correct, but count_holes for high may over/under-count holes due to interaction with low components (e.g., shared 0s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it assigns 1 to several high components (e.g., rows 0-7 cols 9-11: 1s where input likely has >4, but without input grid, assuming similar to trainings, this should be a different color like 2 or 3 based on holes; also rows 17-29 cols 24+: all 1s, but scattered 4s remain in lower right, suggesting incomplete recoloring).
 * It leaves some original >4 values (e.g., 4s in rows 17-29 cols 26-29) unchanged instead of mapping them, which mismatches the rule— all >4 should be replaced by mapping.get(holes, 0), but here it seems to only partially apply (e.g., row 17 col 26: 4 remains, but nearby 1s applied).
 * Upper left low components (1s in rows 0-3,8-14 cols 9-11,24) are preserved correctly, but the large high structure in rows 17-29 (with internal 0s and 4s) is partially 1s and partially unchanged 4s, indicating hole count failed to group the entire component or mapping defaulted wrong (e.g., if holes=0 maps to 1, but some subparts not flooded properly).
 * Does not make sense overall: Expected test output should have consistent recoloring (e.g., the big lower high component likely has 1 hole or 0, mapping to 2 or 3, not mixed 1 and 4); current output has fragmented application, suggesting bug in find_all_high_components (e.g., not grouping all >4 together if they touch via 0s? but code uses g[nx][ny] >4 strictly).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:57:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where small, pre-colored components using low numbers (1-4) act as "keys" that indicate a specific number of enclosed empty spaces (holes, i.e., regions of 0s fully surrounded by the component and not connected to the grid border), and larger components made of high numbers (>4) must be recolored to match the color of the low key that has the same number of holes as the high component encloses. The goal is to process the input grid, identify and analyze low components to build a mapping from hole counts to colors, then apply that mapping to recolor high components while leaving low components (1-4) and empty space (0) unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components (1-4) are connected groups of the same color; they are not recolored and serve only as keys—each is analyzed for its own enclosed holes (counting isolated 0-regions inside it, via flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space).
 * High components (>4) are connected groups of cells >4; they are recolored based on the hole count they enclose (similar flood-fill for holes), mapping to the color of a matching low key; if no match, default to 0.
 * Hole counting is tricky: it requires treating the component as a barrier, flood-filling from all border cells (edges of the grid) through non-barrier, non-visited 0s to mark "exterior" space; any remaining unvisited 0s inside are holes, but only count isolated 0-components (not single cells necessarily, but full connected 0-regions fully enclosed).
 * Mapping from holes to color: not all low components with the same hole count are equivalent; the code sorts low components by size descending, then min_r ascending, then min_c ascending, and takes the first (largest/top-left) for each unique hole count— this may be incorrect if the puzzle intends positional matching, shape similarity, or another tiebreaker (e.g., color order or exact position relative to high components).
 * Grid is 30x30 (inferred from outputs), with many 0s; components don't wrap around edges; directions are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Subtle: In count_holes, the initial flood-fill from borders marks exterior 0s, but the hole counting loop then iterates all cells and flood-fills remaining 0s, incrementing hole_count per such isolated 0-component (not per cell, which the code does correctly via inner while loop).
 * Easy to miss: High components might enclose holes that include low components or other highs? But code treats all non-barrier as traversable for exterior fill, and only counts enclosed 0s as holes—lows (1-4) are not 0s, so they block or are ignored in hole counting; ensure visited prevents recounting.
 * Another subtlety: If multiple low components have the same hole count, the mapping overwrites with the last one in sorted order (code uses if h not in mapping, so first in sorted list wins); this caused mismatches in examples where expected uses a different low color for the same holes.
 * Components must be 4-connected; flood_fill uses BFS with stack=deque popleft.
 * 0s on borders are always exterior; fully internal 0s only count as holes if enclosed by the specific component being analyzed (isolated from borders via that barrier).
 * Low components might have holes themselves, which defines their key value; high components' holes are computed similarly but relative to their own shape.
 * Potential edge case: Components touching borders have no "enclosed" holes from border 0s; zero-hole highs might map to a low with zero holes, or default 0.
 * Copy_grid preserves input for output; only modify high cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    # BFS to find connected component of exact color (1-4); returns cells if matching, else [].
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    if g[sr][sc] != color:
        return []
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    cells = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.popleft()
        if g[x][y] != color:
            continue

        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                visited[nx][ny] = True

(Helpful for extracting low components accurately.)

```
(This is mostly helpful for hole counting, but subtle bug: initial border flood doesn't restrict to 0s—it floods through any non-barrier cells (e.g., other lows or highs), which might incorrectly mark internal non-0s as exterior; should probably only flood through 0s for exterior, and ensure holes only count 0s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly identifies and extracts low/high components via flood-fill and computes holes for them.
 * What worked: Low components are found and sorted; mapping is built per unique hole count; highs are recolored only if mapping exists; output preserves lows and 0s.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, a high component (likely in rows 8-16, cols 9-12, shaped like a blob with holes) is colored 1 instead of expected 4—probably because multiple lows have the same hole count, and sorting by size/min_r/min_c picked the wrong (smaller or lower-positioned) low as the key; e.g., a size-3 '1' component overrode a size-? '4' with matching holes.
 * In training example 1, another high (rows 26-29, cols 17-20) is colored 1 but expected 4—same mapping issue, where expected uses '4' keys for these hole counts, suggesting tiebreaker should prioritize color value, position near the high, or reverse sorting.
 * In training example 2, highs in rows 1-7 cols 18-29 are colored 1 but expected 2—again, mapping picked wrong low (likely a '1' with matching holes over a '2'); another high in rows 9-16 cols 20-29 stays 3? but expected has 3s there? Wait, 3 is low, but output shows some recoloring to 1 where expected 2.
 * Sorting low_comps by (-size, min_r, min_c) works for prioritizing large/top-left, but fails when puzzle expects smallest/bottom-right or color-based priority (e.g., higher color number wins).
 * count_holes seems to overcount or mis-mark exterior if it floods non-0s; in ex1, this might lead to wrong hole counts for lows, causing bad mapping.
 * find_low_components correctly skips 0 and >4, but doesn't handle if lows touch highs.
 * Overall, partial understanding: component extraction and basic mapping work, but tiebreaking for duplicate hole counts and potential flood-fill traversal (through non-0s) break it.
 * No prior attempts, but this one shows the approach is close but needs mapping refinement (e.g., sort by color desc instead of size? or per-high position-based matching).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-relies on color 1 for many high components (e.g., rows 0-7 cols 9-11 and 24-25 are 1s, rows 8-14 cols 0-2 and 8-11 are 1s, rows 17-29 col 24 are all 1s), while leaving some 4-patterns unchanged (rows 17-29 cols 26-28), suggesting the mapping heavily favors '1' keys due to sorting picking them for common hole counts.
 * Expected test output is unknown (no expected provided), but based on training patterns, it likely needs more varied colors (e.g., 2,3,4 for different highs); the uniform 1s indicate same mapping flaw as training—probably all highs have 0-1 holes, mapped to a single '1' low.
 * The 4s in rows 17-29 cols 26-28 remain (as they are <=4, lows are preserved), but surrounding highs are 1s where they might expect 4 or other; a complex high blob in rows 19-29 cols 9-28 (with internal 0s and 4-patterns) is partially 1 and partially unchanged 4/0, but looks like it encloses multiple holes, so should be a single color—output fragments it incorrectly.
 * Hole counting likely wrong for this test's irregular shapes (e.g., the bottom high has protrusions and internal 4s, which might be treated as barriers or not, leading to under/over-count); output doesn't unify the large bottom structure into one color.
 * Test makes partial sense (recolors some highs to 1, keeps lows), but fails to vary colors, suggesting broken mapping/tiebreaker; without input grid, hard to verify exact holes, but differences from training imply same issue.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful for safe grid manipulation.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Perform flood fill to find connected component of cells >4 using 4-connectivity."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    blob = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.popleft()
        if visited[r][c]:
            continue
        visited[r][c] = True
        if g[r][c] <= 4:
            continue
        blob.append((r, c))
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] > 4:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return blob
```
(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where low-value connected components (numbers 1-4, representing colored shapes) are analyzed to create a mapping from the number of enclosed holes (regions of 0s fully surrounded by the component) to a color (1-4). High-value connected components (>4, representing uncolored or placeholder shapes) are then recolored according to this mapping based on their own hole counts, effectively "solving" the puzzle by applying the learned color-hole association consistently across the grid while preserving low components and empty space (0s).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count for connectivity.
 * Holes are strictly enclosed regions of 0s that are fully surrounded by a single component's cells and cannot reach the grid border via adjacent 0s—use a flood fill from borders to mark reachable 0s as non-holes, then count remaining isolated 0-regions within the component's bounding area.
 * Low components (1-4) are never modified; only high components (>4) are recolored, and only if their hole count matches a key in the mapping (otherwise, default to 0 or leave unchanged? but examples suggest mapping to the correct color or 0).
 * Mapping creation: Hole-to-color association should be based on low components, but subtleties include prioritizing components by size (largest first), then position (top-most, then left-most) to resolve ties—do not overwrite mappings for the same hole count; take the "primary" one.
 * Grid borders are always accessible for hole detection; components touching borders cannot enclose holes on that side.
 * 0s are background/empty; they can form holes only if isolated by the component (not connected to outer space).
 * Subtle: Hole counting must treat the component as a barrier, but only count 0s inside its "interior"—avoid counting external 0s or 0s in other components.
 * Components may be irregular shapes (e.g., with bays or protrusions), so hole detection needs robust flood fill to avoid false positives (e.g., U-shapes don't enclose holes).
 * Mapping is one-way: multiple low components might have the same hole count, but only one defines the color for that hole value (based on sorting criteria); high components use this lookup.
 * Preserve all original low (1-4) and 0 cells exactly; only overwrite >4 cells.
 * Edge case: Components with 0 holes map to a color if defined; undefined hole counts for high components should map to 0 (per code, but examples suggest specific colors).
 * Subtle: In hole counting for high components, use the original grid (not modified), and barriers are only the high component's cells—low components or other highs don't block unless adjacent.
 * Grid size is consistent (30x30? from outputs), but assume variable; no wrapping around edges.

(Extracts low components and builds mapping; sorting priority seems correct based on examples, but may need validation if ties cause wrong color picks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided uses a solid structure for component finding and hole counting, correctly identifying low components and applying mapping to high ones.
 * What worked: Flood fill accurately groups same-color cells; hole counting correctly uses border flood to exclude reachable 0s and counts isolated 0-groups as separate holes; mapping avoids duplicates by checking 'if h not in mapping'.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated output assigns color 1 to a high component (rows 8-16, cols 10-12) that should be 4 (expected shows 4s there, e.g., row 8: positions 10-11 as 4,4; generated has 1,1); similarly, row 27: generated has 1s where expected has 4s. This suggests wrong mapping lookup—possibly hole count miscomputed for that high component (e.g., counted 0 holes but mapped to 1 instead of 4) or sorting picked wrong low component for holes=0 or whatever value it has.
 * In training example 1, another mismatch: row 27-30 expected has a large 4-block in cols 17+, but generated has scattered 1s (e.g., row 27: 1,1,1 at cols 17-19); this indicates the high component there was assigned 1 instead of 4, likely same mapping/hole error.
 * In training example 2, generated assigns 1 to large high components (e.g., rows 2-6, cols 14-24 should be 2 per expected, but generated has 1s in places like row 2 cols 18-19); expected has 2s there. Also, row 9 cols 10-12 generated 1,1,1 but expected 2,2,2. Hole counts likely wrong (e.g., that component has 0 holes but mapped to wrong color).
 * Overall, low components are preserved correctly in both trainings (e.g., top shapes in 1-4 unchanged), but high recoloring fails consistently, suggesting bug in count_holes for high components (perhaps barriers not isolating properly, or flooding includes low components' 0s incorrectly) or mapping not capturing all hole values (e.g., missing holes=0 or holes=1 mappings).
 * Sorting in mapping seems to prioritize correctly (largest first), but if multiple low components have same holes and sizes, min_r/min_c tiebreaker may pick wrong "representative" color.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (flood_fill_same, count_holes, etc.) are relevant and mostly correct, but count_holes for high may over/under-count holes due to interaction with low components (e.g., shared 0s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it assigns 1 to several high components (e.g., rows 0-7 cols 9-11: 1s where input likely has >4, but without input grid, assuming similar to trainings, this should be a different color like 2 or 3 based on holes; also rows 17-29 cols 24+: all 1s, but scattered 4s remain in lower right, suggesting incomplete recoloring).
 * It leaves some original >4 values (e.g., 4s in rows 17-29 cols 26-29) unchanged instead of mapping them, which mismatches the rule— all >4 should be replaced by mapping.get(holes, 0), but here it seems to only partially apply (e.g., row 17 col 26: 4 remains, but nearby 1s applied).
 * Upper left low components (1s in rows 0-3,8-14 cols 9-11,24) are preserved correctly, but the large high structure in rows 17-29 (with internal 0s and 4s) is partially 1s and partially unchanged 4s, indicating hole count failed to group the entire component or mapping defaulted wrong (e.g., if holes=0 maps to 1, but some subparts not flooded properly).
 * Does not make sense overall: Expected test output should have consistent recoloring (e.g., the big lower high component likely has 1 hole or 0, mapping to 2 or 3, not mixed 1 and 4); current output has fragmented application, suggesting bug in find_all_high_components (e.g., not grouping all >4 together if they touch via 0s? but code uses g[nx][ny] >4 strictly).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components where small "key" shapes (colored 1-4, exactly 3 rows high) encode color mappings via the number of enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the border), and larger "orange" blobs (high values, potentially including 4) are recolored to match the key color associated with their own enclosed hole count, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be connected components of the same color (1-4) with exact height 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); taller or shorter components are ignored, even if they visually resemble keys (e.g., a full-height vertical line of 1's is one component of height 30, not multiple keys).
 * Holes are strictly internal 0's disconnected from the grid border; the count_holes function uses BFS from border non-barrier cells to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unmarked 0's inside the shape—subtlety: barriers are only the component cells themselves, so adjacent 0's outside the component but enclosed by it count as holes if not border-connected.
 * Multiple keys with the same hole count: select the "best" (smallest min_r, then smallest min_c) to map hole count to a single color; if no key for a blob's hole count, set blob to 0.
 * Blobs are connected components of high values (code assumes >4 for "orange"), but subtlety: in the test case, values are exactly 4, suggesting blobs may include ==4; unconnected or isolated high cells aren't blobs.
 * Grid is copied before modification to avoid altering input; directions for connectivity are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical or irregular key shapes may span height >3 if connected, breaking key detection; hole counting ignores the blob/key color value (treats as barrier) but requires grid[r][c]==0 for internal cells; border enqueue in count_holes has redundancy (corners enqueued twice) but works; if no components, output is unchanged copy.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes fixed height=3 for keys (may not generalize if keys vary); blob detection misses ==4; no handling for keys/blobs overlapping or touching borders in ways that affect hole counting; potential for 0-hole keys to map blobs with 0 enclosures.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (both passed, likely due to keys being height 3 and blobs >4).
 * Missed detecting keys in test case: vertical line of 1's forms single component height ~30 !=3, so no key_components found, no hole-to-color mapping created.
 * find_orange_blobs is broken for test case: searches for >4, but test has patterns of exactly 4, so no blobs processed; output is effectively unchanged copy of input (1's and 4's remain, rest 0's).
 * count_holes and find_key_components are helpful and correct for their logic, but unused in test due to upstream failures.
 * No prior attempts to note, but this attempt assumes fixed blob threshold >4 (not general); height==3 is rigid and misses tall keys; mapping uses min position for ties (worked in training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a full vertical column of 1's (column index 24, all rows), unchanged, and repeating patterns of 4's in rows 17-28 (columns 26-28, forming what looks like 6 vertical "E"-like or barred shapes, each 3 rows high with internal 0's), also unchanged, surrounded by 0's everywhere else.
 * This does not look correct: No recoloring occurred, suggesting the program failed to identify the 4-patterns as blobs (because ==4, not >4) or find matching keys (1's too tall for height==3 check); expected output should recolor the 4-blobs to some color 1-4 based on their enclosed holes matching a key's holes, or to 0, but instead it's static—likely the vertical 1's are meant as multiple stacked keys or a different detection rule, and 4's are the target blobs; difference is total lack of modification, which mismatches puzzle goal of transforming blobs via keys (unknown exact expected colors, but output should differ visibly in the 4 areas).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where "legend" shapes (connected components of colors 1-4 that are rectangular/large enough) define a mapping from the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") within them to their color. Orange blobs (connected regions of values >4) are then recolored based on matching their own hole count to this mapping, or set to 0 if no match, effectively classifying unknown orange shapes by their topological similarity (hole count) to known legends.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are only valid connected components (4-directional adjacency) of the same color from 1-4 that span more than one row and one column (height >1 and width >1), excluding single cells or lines.
 * Holes are fully enclosed regions of 0's (background) that are not connected to the grid border; the count_holes function correctly implements a flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unvisited 0's as distinct holes.
 * Mapping from hole count to color takes the first encountered legend for each unique hole count (sorted by position), so order matters and duplicates aren't handled—could overwrite if not careful, but code avoids it by checking "if h not in mapping".
 * Orange blobs (>4, connected 4-directionally) are recolored entirely to the mapped color if their hole count matches a legend's, or to 0 otherwise; non-orange regions (0-4) remain unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Hole counting treats the component's cells as barriers, but only counts enclosed 0's—other colors inside aren't considered holes, and the flood-fill ensures only truly enclosed areas are counted.
 * Grid is 30x30 based on outputs; assumes rectangular grid with no wrapping.
 * Potential miss: If a legend or blob touches the border, its "holes" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0; also, diagonal connections don't count (only orthogonal).
 * In mapping, only legends contribute; single-color lines or small shapes aren't legends, so ignored.
 * For blobs, if hole count doesn't match any legend, set to 0 (erasing the orange), which might be a way to "remove" unmatched unknowns.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of legends by (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent mapping order, preventing position-based variability.

(Combines legends and hole counting into mapping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission provided; it correctly solved training example 1, indicating solid understanding of legend extraction, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output colored the large central shape (around rows 2-6, cols 13-23) entirely as 1's, but expected 2's; also left some small areas (e.g., row 1 cols 18-19 as 1's instead of 2's, row 9 cols 10-12 as 1's instead of 2's) mismatched, and bottom orange blobs (rows 19-29, various cols) have partial recoloring (some 3's remain or are wrong, e.g., row 20 cols 20-21 as 3's but expected partial 3's with 2's nearby? Wait, differences are scattered—e.g., row 9 col 10-12: generated 1's vs expected 2's; row 15 col 21-22: generated 3's vs expected 0's? Unknown exact cause, but likely miscomputed hole count for the central blob or wrong legend mapping due to multiple legends with overlapping hole counts).
 * What worked: Legend detection and basic BFS for components/holes seems robust (passed train1); mapping logic applies correctly when hole counts are unique/simple.
 * What didn't: In train2, the central blob was treated as having a hole count matching color 1's legend instead of 2's, suggesting either wrong hole count (e.g., overcounting/underCounting enclosures due to barrier setup) or mapping overwrite/selection error from sorting; also, some orange sub-blobs weren't fully recolored, leaving 3's where expected 2's or 0's.
 * count_holes is helpful and seems correct (no issues in train1), but may fail if component cells don't fully barrier internal 0's (e.g., if legend has internal non-0 but code only barriers the legend cells).
 * find_orange_blobs is helpful but in train2 didn't group all connected >4 properly, leading to partial coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided seem relevant, though get_legends wrapper is just a filter and could be inlined.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It introduces a vertical column of 1's (column 24, rows 0-29) where the input likely had 0's or empty space, suggesting erroneous detection of a "legend" or blob there (possibly misreading a thin vertical structure as a legend with holes mapping to 1, or a bug in component finding treating border/empty as component).
 * The bottom orange regions (rows 18-29, cols 25-28 with 4's, likely >4 in input but shown as 4's—wait, code treats >4 as orange, but output leaves most 4's unchanged, indicating either input has exactly 4 (treated as legend, not blob) or bug in find_orange_blobs (if values=4 not >4, they stay as-is, but expected recoloring suggests they should be blobs—possible subtlety: input may use 5+ for orange, but output shows 4's untouched, meaning no recoloring happened, wrong if they match a hole mapping).
 * Upper grid is all 0's except the spurious 1's column, implying no legends/blobs detected in top (possibly correct if test has isolated elements), but the unchanged 4's in bottom suggest failure to identify them as recolorable blobs (e.g., if they are connected but hole count doesn't match, should be 0's, not left as 4's—output has them as 4's with some 0's inside, indicating no processing).
 * Overall, test output makes little sense: Spurious 1's column is an artifact (likely false positive component), and lack of recoloring on bottom 4's/0's mix means blobs weren't processed or mapped (expected probably to color bottom blobs to a legend color like 1-3 based on holes, but instead partial original values remain); this highlights a bug in threshold (>4) or hole computation for test's topology.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with legend shapes (small connected components of colors 1-4 that span exactly 3 rows in height) and larger blob shapes (connected regions to be colored). The goal is to color each blob uniformly using the color from the h-th legend (sorted by position), where h is the number of enclosed holes (isolated connected 0-regions inside the blob, treating the blob as a barrier), if h is less than the number of legends; otherwise, clear the blob to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are connected components of the same color (1-4) with a bounding box height exactly 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); they are not necessarily vertical bars but any connected shape spanning exactly 3 rows vertically; only these are collected and sorted by (min_r, min_c) for indexing.
 * Blobs are connected components of cells >4 (using 4-directional connectivity); the program assumes unknowns are marked >4, but this misses cases where blobs use colors 1-4 (e.g., test uses 4 for the blob).
 * Hole counting treats blob cells as barriers: flood-fill from grid borders through non-barrier (non-blob) cells to mark exterior space (including 0s and other non-blobs); then, each separate connected component of unvisited 0s inside the barriers counts as one hole (not per cell, but per enclosed region).
 * Output starts as a copy of input; only blobs are modified (colored or cleared); legends and other cells (e.g., tall components of 1-4, background 0s) remain unchanged.
 * Subtle: Legends must be exactly height 3; taller or shorter connected 1-4 components (like the test's full-height 1 column or 11-row 4 blob) are ignored as legends and not treated as blobs if <=4, leaving them unchanged—which can produce incorrect outputs if such components are meant to be the blobs.
 * Subtle: Hole flood-fill starts only from border cells (top/bottom rows fully, left/right columns); interior non-0 non-blobs might affect enclosure if not handled, but code marks all reachable non-barrier from borders.
 * Subtle: If no legends (len(legends)==0), all blobs get h < 0 false, so cleared to 0 regardless of holes.
 * Subtle: Multiple blobs are processed independently; each gets its own hole count relative to global legends list.
 * Consideration: Grid is rectangular (e.g., 30x30 in test); assumes uniform size; 0 is background/empty, but only 0s count as potential holes (non-0 interiors don't count as holes).
 * Consideration: Connected components use BFS (deque stack, but popleft makes it BFS); 4 directions (orthogonal, no diagonals).
 * Easy to miss: The test blob (4s) encloses holes (e.g., the 0s in column 27, rows 18,20,etc., might form enclosed regions if treated as blob); visually, the 4 pattern looks like stacked "E" or bars with gaps, likely having 1+ holes per section, but code doesn't process it.
 * Easy to miss: If blobs touch borders, their "interior" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0.
 * Across attempts: Only this one attempt shown; assumes prior ones led here, but focuses on >4 blobs working for training but failing when blobs reuse 1-4 colors.

    # ... (full code as provided)

    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Orchestrates: copy, find legends, find blobs, color each blob based on holes vs. legends index; works end-to-end for >4 blobs but fails when blobs are <=4.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identified and colored blobs in training examples 1 and 2, where blobs were likely marked >4 and hole counts matched legend indexing properly.
 * Failed to detect the test blob (connected 4s, height 11) as it uses color 4 (<=4 and not height 3), so treated as neither legend nor blob—left unchanged as 4s, producing output with uncolored blob structure.
 * The tall vertical 1s (height 30) were not detected as legend (height !=3) and not blob (<=4), so left as 1s—likely correct if it's a non-colorable element, but unclear without expected output.
 * No legends detected in test (only height-3 qualify, and neither 1s nor 4s match), so even if blobs were found, they'd clear to 0; but since no blobs, nothing changes.
 * find_blobs is helpful for >4 but broken/not general for test (misses 1-4 blobs); don't use as-is—extend to connected components excluding height-3 legends.
 * count_holes is essential and correct for hole logic, but unhelpful without proper blob extraction.
 * find_legends is essential for color keys but too narrow (only height==3); misses if test has no such legends.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond narrow blob detection; copy_grid and component finding (BFS) are solid tools to reuse.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it retains the full input structure—a vertical column of 1s (column 24, all 30 rows) and a connected blob of 4s (columns 26-28, rows 17-27, forming a pattern with internal 0s like stacked bars/gaps)—without any coloring or clearing of the 4 blob, suggesting no blobs were detected or processed.
 * Expected: The 4 structure should be treated as a blob, its internal 0s (e.g., isolated in column 27) counted as holes (likely 5-6 separate hole regions from the pattern), then colored uniformly to a legend color (but no legends found, so probably cleared to 0) or perhaps to 1 if the tall 1s are misinterpreted; the output keeping 4s means the blob wasn't handled, leaving visible "unknown" regions.
 * The vertical 1s remain, which might be correct (not a blob/legend), but the overall output looks like an unchanged input with no puzzle resolution—blobs should be resolved to 1-4 or 0.
 * No >4 visible, confirming blob detection failed; the pattern suggests 1-2 holes per "E"-like section (gaps enclosed if blob is barrier), but unprocessed so unknown exact h; output differs from expected by not unifying the 4s to a single color/0.
 * Make sure to account for blobs using 1-4 colors (not just >4) and potentially no height-3 legends (e.g., use tall 1s as color source?) to handle test case.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based components where small "key" shapes (connected regions of the same color 1-4 spanning exactly 3 rows) are identified, and their properties (like enclosed hole counts) are used to assign colors to larger connected components (regions of cells >=4) based on matching enclosed hole counts; unmatched large components are cleared to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be exactly 3 rows high (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3), connected via same-color (1-4) flood fill, and are sorted by their top-left position (min_r, then min_c).
 * Hole counting is not the total number of 0-cells enclosed by a component, but the number of distinct connected components of enclosed 0-cells (i.e., separate "holes" not reachable from the grid border, treating the component cells as barriers); this is computed by flooding from borders to mark reachable non-barrier cells, then counting and flooding each remaining connected group of 0 non-barrier cells.
 * Large components are connected regions of cells >=4; they are skipped (left unchanged) only if exactly 3 rows high and all cells exactly 4 (not higher); otherwise, if their hole count indexes into the list of keys (h < len(keys)), the entire component is recolored to the matching key's color; if h >= len(keys), set to 0.
 * Components with values <=4 (but not exactly 3-high all-4) are not treated as "large" since flood_fill_ge4 only includes >=4; low-value components (<=3) are ignored for recoloring unless they form keys.
 * Border flooding for holes must avoid barriers (the component cells) and only considers 0-cells as potential holes; non-0 non-barrier cells (e.g., other colors) are treated as reachable but not counted as holes.
 * Vertical or irregular shapes may lead to miscomputed heights or connections; ensure flood fills respect exact connectivity (4-directional).
 * If no keys exist or hole counts exceed available keys, large components default to 0, potentially clearing much of the grid.
 * Subtle: In hole counting, the initial border enqueue includes only non-barrier border cells, and the hole scan only increments for unvisited 0 non-barrier cells, ensuring enclosed 0-components are counted separately even if adjacent but separated by barriers elsewhere.
 * Potential miss: Keys' own holes are computed similarly, but since keys are small (3-high), they may enclose 0 or few hole components; large components' holes can be more complex due to size.
 * Ensure grid copying preserves original for output; visited marks prevent reprocessing.

(Essential for extracting and sorting key components; filters to 3-high same-color 1-4 regions and computes their holes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; training examples 1 and 2 both passed correctly, indicating the core logic (key extraction, hole counting as connected components, and large component recoloring) works for those cases.
 * The skipping condition for 3-high all-4 components (not recoloring them) worked for training but may be a subtlety—perhaps all-4 regions are "special" or pre-colored keys/large blobs that should remain.
 * Hole counting as number of connected 0-components (not total 0-cells) appears correct since training passed; total cells might be an easy miss.
 * find_keys correctly ignores non-3-high or >4 color components for keys.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the all_low check (all <=4 in ge4 flood) is tautological for ==4 but ensures skipping pure-4 3-high; if this is wrong for test, it could leave unintended regions unchanged.
 * Potential issue: If input has only low-value keys (like the vertical 1s) and no large >=4 components, output remains mostly unchanged (e.g., just the keys visible).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 30x30 grid (inferred from list lengths) that is entirely 0s except for a single vertical column of 1s (at index 24 in each of the 30 rows), resulting in a thin, unbroken line of 1s spanning the full height.
 * This does not look correct for a typical puzzle output, as it suggests minimal processing: likely the input contained these 1s as a connected key component (possibly 3-high segments or full-height, but treated as keys), with the rest as 0s or <4, and no large >=4 components to recolor—leading to an output that is essentially the input unchanged except possibly clearing non-matching areas to 0.
 * Expected output should likely include recolored large regions (e.g., filled areas with colors 1-4 based on holes matching keys), not just an isolated vertical line; the all-0 background with only 1s indicates either no large components in input or a bug in detecting/recoloring them (e.g., if the line is not exactly 3-high per key or holes don't match).
 * Difference from expected: No evidence of hole-based coloring or component filling; if test input has enclosed 0-regions or >=4 blobs, they should appear colored, but here everything else is 0—suggests the program cleared too much or missed components (unknown why, possibly input lacks >=4 or height condition fails broadly).
 * To handle test: Ensure large components aren't skipped incorrectly (e.g., revise skipping only for exact all-4 3-high); verify if vertical keys are split into 3-high segments for multiple keys.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent "heights" or colors; low-height connected components (values 1-4) act as a "key" by associating their colors with the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") they create, and high-height connected blobs (values >4) are then recolored to match the key color corresponding to the number of holes they similarly enclose, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components are strictly same-value connected groups (4-directional adjacency) for values 1-4; high blobs are any connected >4 cells (regardless of exact value).
 * Holes are the number of distinct connected components of 0-cells that are fully enclosed (not reachable from the grid border via other 0-cells or non-barrier spaces); the component itself acts as a barrier during hole counting.
 * Low components are sorted by descending size, then ascending min_row, then ascending min_col (prioritizing largest, then topmost-leftmost) before building the hole-to-color mapping; only the first (highest-priority) low component per unique hole count is used in the mapping—duplicates are ignored.
 * If a high blob's hole count has no mapping, it defaults to 0 (erased); low components and 0s are never modified.
 * Border flooding in hole counting starts from all border non-barrier cells (including 0s and other non-component cells) to mark all reachable space; enclosed holes are then detected as separate connected 0-components in the unmarked interior.
 * Subtlety: Hole count is per connected 0-region (not total 0-cells), so a large empty area counts as 1 hole if connected.
 * Subtlety: Barriers for hole counting are only the cells of the current component being analyzed—other grid cells (including other components or high/low values) are traversable unless they are the barrier.
 * Subtlety: The grid may have "divider" lines or vertical/horizontal 1s (as seen in test), which could be low components themselves; ensure flood fill doesn't cross value boundaries for low comps.
 * All components must be processed in order, but mapping is global (one per hole count across all low comps).
 * 0s are empty space only for hole detection; they don't form components.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 30x30 in test), so all functions must be dimension-agnostic.

(Extracts all low components with metadata; uses flood_fill_same and count_holes. Helpful for building the key mapping; includes size/position for sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; no prior iterations shown.
 * Successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely correctly (full match to expected outputs).
 * For test input, the program correctly identified and left low components (1-4) unchanged, as per rules.
 * Sorting low components by (size desc, min_r asc, min_c asc) and taking first unique hole-to-color mapping worked for training, ensuring consistent key assignment.
 * Hole counting via border flood + enclosed 0-component detection is accurate and handled training cases without issues (no over/under-counting of holes).
 * High blob processing (flood fill any >4, count holes, map to color or 0) was not triggered in test (or mapped to existing low colors), as output shows only 0/1/4.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt—all provided (e.g., flood_fill_same, count_holes) are relevant, correct, and essential; avoid reinventing without need.
 * Potential subtlety missed in general: If test had >4 cells, they should appear as 1-4 or 0 in output based on holes; the code handles this but test output suggests no >4 or all mapped to 1 (e.g., the vertical 1-line and left shapes remain 1s, right 4-shapes remain 4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid with mostly 0s, scattered 1s forming shapes on the left/top (e.g., possible letters/numbers in rows 0-3, 7-14, 17-18) and a vertical line of 1s in column 24 across all rows, plus a complex shape of 4s in the bottom-right (rows 17-29, columns 25-29, forming irregular connected regions with internal 0s).
 * It makes sense as output: Low components (1s and 4s) are unchanged, 0s intact; if test input had >4 cells (e.g., in the right shape or elsewhere), they were correctly replaced (possibly to 1, explaining the 1-line if it was high-mapped). No >4 remains, as expected.
 * However, without the raw test input grid or expected output, it's unclear if mappings were applied correctly (e.g., did the 4-shape enclose holes matching a 1-key? Why not recolored?). The vertical 1-line looks like a persistent low component or mapped high, but the overall structure (left shapes as 1s, right as 4s) suggests correct non-modification of lows. It looks plausible/correct based on rules, but the right 4-shape's internal 0s (visible in rows 20-29) imply it could enclose holes—if it's low (4<=4), holes aren't used for it, but if input had >4 there, output should have recolored based on those holes (e.g., to 1 if mapping[hole_count]=1). Difference: Output retains 4s, which would be wrong if those were high >4 in input (expected recolor to key color); unknown without input, but code would handle it correctly per training success.
 * No obvious errors (e.g., no stray >4, no modified lows), so it aligns with expectations; subtle issue if test has high in 4-positions but output didn't map (but code looks fine).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:01:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where 0 represents empty space, 1-4 represent "low" colored regions (connected components of the exact same value), and values >4 represent "high" uncolored regions (connected components regardless of specific high value). The goal is to preserve low regions, analyze them to create a mapping from the number of enclosed "holes" (isolated 0-regions fully surrounded by a component and not reachable from the grid border) to a specific color (1-4), and then recolor each high region with the color from the mapping based on its own enclosed hole count (defaulting to 0 if no mapping exists), while leaving all other cells (0s and low regions) unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components (1-4) are strictly 4-connected (up/down/left/right) and must share the exact same value to be part of the same component; different values (e.g., 1 adjacent to 2) are separate even if touching.
 * High components (>4) are also 4-connected but can include any high values (e.g., 5 and 6 can connect); they are not restricted to the same value.
 * Holes are defined as connected components of 0-cells that are fully enclosed by a specific component (low or high) and cannot be reached from the grid border via other 0-cells; this requires a flood-fill from the border to mark "exterior" 0s, then counting separate unvisited 0-components inside the barrier formed by the component's cells.
 * The mapping from holes to color is derived only from low components: for each hole count, select the highest color (1-4) among all low components that have that exact hole count; if multiple low components share a hole count, the max color wins for that hole count in the mapping.
 * Preserve all low (1-4) and 0 cells unchanged in the output; only recolor high (>4) cells.
 * Edge cases: Components touching the border may have 0 exterior holes; single-cell components have 0 holes; holes must be strictly enclosed (no path to border through 0s); avoid counting exterior 0s as holes; ensure deep copying to prevent mutating input.
 * Subtlety: The count_holes function must treat the component cells as "barriers" but allow 0-paths around them only if not enclosed; border flooding must carefully enqueue all border 0s without duplication (e.g., corners).
 * Another subtlety: If no low component has a certain hole count, high components with that hole count default to 0 (blank).
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); assume valid input with 0 <= values, but focus on 0,1-4,>4.
 * Potential miss: Overcounting holes if flood-fill leaks through non-barrier high/low cells; undercounting if border flood misses diagonal touches (but 4-connected only).
 * The puzzle emphasizes "enclosed" holes, so partial enclosures (e.g., open to border) don't count; this is key for irregular shapes.

                            visited[nx][ny] = True

    # (Helpful, but may be the source of errors if max isn't the right aggregation; consider alternatives like min or mode if mismatches persist)
    pass  # Full in attempt
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core structure (identifying low/high components via flood-fill, computing holes, mapping, and recoloring only highs) worked well for preserving low regions (1-4) and 0s unchanged, as seen in the top sections of both training examples matching expected.
 * Low component detection (flood_fill_same) correctly identified separate components by exact color, e.g., the 1,2,3,4 blobs in train1 rows 1-3 are preserved identically in generated vs. expected.
 * Border flooding in count_holes partially worked, as some enclosed holes seem correctly identified (e.g., no overcounting of exterior 0s), but the final hole count per component led to wrong mappings.
 * High component detection (flood_fill_high) worked for grouping >4 cells regardless of value, but recoloring failed due to incorrect mapping application.
 * In train1: Generated incorrectly kept many high regions as 4 (e.g., row9 cols3-5: 4,4,4 vs. expected 3,3,3; row10 col2:4 vs.3; row11 col20-25:4s vs. expected 1s) while expected recolored to 3,1,2,4 in specific high blobs; this suggests the mapping assigned max=4 for hole counts that should map to lower colors (e.g., a hole count shared by a 4 and 3 low component took 4, but puzzle may want min, or unique assignment, or color=holes+something; unknown why, but difference is clear in left/mid high blobs).
 * In train1: Some areas correct (e.g., row12 col20-25: expected 1s, but generated has 4s there? Wait, generated row11 has 4s in col20-25, expected 1s; mismatch in enclosure count or max selection).
 * In train1: Bottom rows (e.g., row26-29) generated has scattered 4s where expected has 4s in some places but 0s/1s elsewhere; partial match but wrong for hole-based recoloring (e.g., row27 col16-19: generated 4s vs. expected 4s, good; but row22 col12-15: generated 4s vs. expected 2s).
 * In train2: Top low regions preserved (e.g., rows1-3: 2s and 3s match); but high recoloring wrong, e.g., row2 col18-21: generated 3s vs. expected 2s; row4 col13-25: generated 3s vs. expected 2s; row9 col10-17: generated 3s vs. expected 2s in some parts; suggests over-assignment of 3 (perhaps max color bias for hole=1 or similar).
 * In train2: Later rows worse, e.g., row10 col20-29: generated 3s vs. expected 3s in parts but 0s elsewhere; row15 col1 and col8-17: generated 3s vs. expected 2s; consistent error in mapping favoring higher colors.
 * build_hole_to_color_mapping uses max(color) per hole count, which seems logical but fails both trainings (always picks highest, leading to over-coloring with 3/4 instead of expected 1/2); this is likely the main bug—consider if puzzle wants the color of the low component with that hole count, assuming unique, or min, or sorted assignment.
 * count_holes counts number of hole components (good), but may under/overcount if barriers don't fully enclose (e.g., if high/low cells don't block all paths); in train1, a blob with expected 1-hole colored 3 but generated as 4 suggests wrong hole count or mapping.
 * apply_color_to_cells is correct and helpful for output modification.
 * find_high_components and find_all_low_components are helpful and mostly correct, but depend on flood-fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though count_holes border enqueue has minor duplication risk (but didn't cause observed errors).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it largely preserves original high values (many 4s and scattered 1s) without evident recoloring based on holes, similar to training mismatches (e.g., large connected 4-regions in rows 2-6 cols1-8 remain 4s, but if they enclose different holes, should recolor to 1-3 per mapping; row20 cols0-7: all 4s, likely a high component that should be recolored if holes match a low-derived mapping).
 * It includes unexpected 1s in a vertical strip (col24 across rows0-29), which may be a misidentified low component or wrong preservation, but expected should preserve only original 1s (if any) and recolor highs; this strip looks like over-preservation or bug in component detection.
 * Scattered 4s in bottom rows (e.g., row29 cols6-15: 4s) suggest incomplete recoloring; without expected, it doesn't align with training patterns where highs get 1/2/3 based on holes (e.g., enclosed blobs should not stay 4).
 * Overall, it fails to show systematic hole-based recoloring (e.g., no clear shift to 2s or 3s in enclosed areas), indicating the mapping or hole-count is still broken for irregular test shapes; account for complex enclosures (e.g., multi-hole high components) and ensure unique hole-to-color (no max if conflicts).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 20:01:17] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids of non-negative integers (likely 0 for empty/background, 1-4 for colored/filled cells representing patterns or "objects" like lines, shapes, or text), where the goal appears to be to process the input grid by cleaning, extracting, or modifying connected components or runs of the same number (1-4) while handling noise (possibly numbers >4) to produce structured outputs with specific patterns of solid and dashed runs separated by 0s, potentially forming letters, numbers, or symbols across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs consist of runs of the same number (1-4) separated by 0s, with alternating rows often showing "solid" runs (consecutive same numbers) in even rows and "dashed" runs (same number alternating with 0s) in odd rows, suggesting a rule for rendering bold/thin or connected/disconnected lines/shapes.
 * Numbers >4 in the input likely represent noise or invalid cells that must be zeroed out, but simply zeroing them everywhere fails because lower sections of the grid contain valid patterns (1-4) that are preserved in expected outputs—implying the zeroing should only apply to isolated noise, not entire valid objects.
 * Connected components (blobs) of the same number seem important: expected outputs preserve and structure multi-row/multi-column groups (e.g., in train1 rows 8-15, complex overlapping shapes of 3s and 4s; in train2 rows 8-10, extended 2s and 3s), while generated outputs zero out or ignore lower-grid objects, suggesting a need to detect and extract/keep valid blobs based on size, shape, or connectivity.
 * Grid is likely 30x30, with patterns distributed vertically (top for simple runs, middle/lower for complex shapes), and 0s act as separators—subtlety: do not fill or connect across 0s unless part of a rule for "growing" or "thinning" shapes.
 * All 1s rows (e.g., train1 row 5 in generated) appear erroneous and not in expected, indicating over-preservation of uniform lines without checking context.
 * Subtle element: Patterns may represent text or icons (e.g., train1 top looks like "4312" in run-length style; lower like scattered letters), so rules might involve recognizing and standardizing font-like renderings (solid vs. dashed for visibility).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle varying object sizes (short runs in top vs. large blobs in bottom); avoid global zeroing of >4 without blob detection; preserve spacing (0s between runs); potential for modulo or remapping >4 to 1-4 if they form valid shapes, but this attempt didn't explore that.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have no numbers >0 in many rows (all 0s), but generated fills them incorrectly; vertical alignment matters (e.g., columns must align patterns across rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided or generated in this attempt. The current program lacks any extraction logic, so future attempts should include connected component labeling (e.g., using flood fill to identify blobs of same number) or run-length encoding to detect and standardize patterns. For example, a basic skeleton for blob extraction:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import numpy as np  # Assuming we can use numpy for grid ops, if allowed

def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Extracts connected components (4-connected or 8-connected) for each number 1-4.
    Returns a dict of {color: list of (r,c) positions} for blobs larger than a threshold (e.g., size >1).
    Ignores 0 and >4.
    """
    grid = np.array(g)
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    blobs = {}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # 4-connected
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if 1 <= grid[r,c] <= 4 and not visited[r,c]:
                color = grid[r,c]
                blob = []
                stack = [(r,c)]
                while stack:
                    x,y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x,y]: continue
                    visited[x,y] = True
                    blob.append((x,y))
                    for dx,dy in directions:
                        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx,ny] and grid[nx,ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx,ny))
                if len(blob) > 1:  # Threshold to ignore noise
                    if color not in blobs:
                        blobs[color] = []
                    blobs[color].extend(blob)
    return blobs
```

This could help identify valid objects before processing (e.g., zero non-blob >4, standardize blob shapes to solid/dashed).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) used a simple global zeroing of cells >4, which partially worked for the top sections of both training examples by cleaning noise and producing run-like patterns (e.g., train1 rows 1-3 show 4s/3s/1s/2s with 0 separators, matching expected structure there), but failed broadly by zeroing entire lower-grid sections (rows ~7-30 in train1 become all 0s except an erroneous all-1s row, while expected has complex preserved patterns of 1-4).
 * For train1: Generated top matches expected top closely (solid/dashed runs of 4/3/1/2), but omits all lower patterns (e.g., expected row8 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,...] for 4s, but generated is all 0s); unexpected all-1s in row5 (expected all 0s); specific difference: generated row3 has spaced 0s in 3s/1s/2s matching expected, but overall grid truncation via zeroing.
 * For train2: Generated top partially matches (2s/3s/1s runs), but inserts erroneous 0s/1s in places (e.g., expected row1 has single 1 at col9, generated matches; but row2 expected has 2s then 3s then 1, generated has similar but zeros later parts); lower grid mostly 0s (e.g., expected row7 has 2s, generated all 0s); all-1s in row6 mismatches expected partial 1s/2s.
 * Missed connected component detection: Zeroing >4 blindly removes valid lower blobs (assuming input lower has >4 in pattern positions, but expected remaps or preserves them as 1-4).
 * No handling of pattern standardization (solid vs. dashed rows), leading to incomplete shapes.
 * The simple loop for zeroing >4 is somewhat helpful for noise removal but broken for full puzzle (not relevant beyond initial cleaning; don't use as core logic in future, as it ignores object extraction).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flawed pattern as training (partial preservation via >4 zeroing, but likely over-zeroing valid parts).
 * It shows a vertical column of 1s in column 24 (indices 0-based col 24) across rows 0-29 (except possibly some), which may be a preserved uniform line but appears erroneous (no such full column in training expecteds, suggesting over-preservation of a thin vertical object without spacing/dashing).
 * Lower rows (17-27) show dashed patterns of 4s (e.g., row17: 4,4,4 at end; row18: 4,0,4,0,... matching a dashed style), which partially resembles expected dashed rules but is isolated and doesn't connect to upper 1s column, looking incomplete/fragmented.
 * Upper rows (0-16) are mostly 0s except the 1s column, suggesting the program zeroed a large top section (likely input had >4 there), but without expected test output, it's unclear—however, it doesn't make holistic sense as a full puzzle solution (e.g., no integrated shapes across grid, just a line + partial dashes, unlike training's multi-object expecteds).
 * Why not correct: Mirrors training failures by zeroing too much (empty top/middle) and not extracting/processing full objects (e.g., if test has complex lower shapes like training, they're partially dashed but not fully structured); the 1s column looks like an unprocessed artifact, not a valid pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires identifying connected components (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 in a grid and recoloring them with the values 4, 3, 2, 1 in a cycling sequence, while leaving cells <=4 unchanged. The goal is to produce an output grid that matches expected colorings for specific blob identifications, but the current approach fails due to the order in which blobs are discovered and colored.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) consisting only of cells >4; cells <=4 are not part of any blob and must remain unchanged (e.g., input 1's stay as 1's, 0's stay 0's).
 * Coloring cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] for each new blob discovered, but the row-major scanning order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) leads to mismatched colors compared to expected outputs, suggesting the puzzle requires a specific discovery or assignment order (e.g., sorting blobs by size, top-left position, or another criterion like largest first or by row/column priority).
 * All blobs must be fully connected internally via >4 cells; partial or disconnected >4 cells in the same scan path get the same color only if truly connected.
 * Grid is mutated only for >4 cells during coloring; the copy_grid function correctly avoids altering the input.
 * Subtlety: Expected outputs show consistent top sections matching generated (e.g., top blobs colored 4,3,1,2 correctly in order), but lower/mid sections mismatch, indicating early blobs are found correctly but later ones get wrong colors due to cycle progression (e.g., a blob gets 2 instead of 1 because prior blobs advanced the cycle incorrectly).
 * No handling for blob size or type differentiation beyond connectivity; all >4 blobs are treated equally, but expected suggests possible implicit prioritization.
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns of 0's must stay 0; isolated >4 cells count as single-cell blobs; no 8-connectivity or diagonal links.
 * The full row of 1's in train1 (row 5) remains unchanged in both generated and expected, confirming <=4 preservation works.
 * In train2, large connected 2-blobs (e.g., rows 2-6) are over-colored in generated (spilling into non-blob areas or wrong cycle), while expected isolates them properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful and correct for preserving the input.)

```python
def find_and_color_high_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Find connected components of cells >4 (4-connected, any >4 value) and assign colors cycling 4,3,2,1."""
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    color_cycle = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    cycle_index = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = color_cycle[cycle_index % 4]
                cycle_index += 1
                stack = deque([(r, c)])
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.popleft()
                    if visited[x][y]:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    grid[x][y] = color
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] > 4:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
    return grid
```
(This is mostly helpful for blob detection and BFS traversal via deque/stack, correctly identifies 4-connected >4 components, and uses visited to avoid re-processing; the issue is only in the inline coloring during discovery—better to collect all blobs first, then assign colors in sorted order.)

No other functions provided; no extraction tools for objects beyond this.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it correctly preserves <=4 cells (e.g., full 1-row in train1 unchanged, 0's intact) and properly detects top blobs in train1 (colors 4,3,1,2 match expected for rows 1-3).
 * Failed to match train1 lower blobs: e.g., row11 right-side blob colored 2 (generated) vs. 1 (expected); row12 has 1's misplaced as 4's in some spots; row15 has 4's where expected has 1's; row16 has 2's where expected has 1's—likely due to cycle advancing on smaller/earlier blobs, assigning lower colors to later larger ones.
 * Failed train2 entirely in mid-section: e.g., rows 2-6 large 2-blob overextends in generated (colors 4's spilling into non-connected areas? Wait, no—actually colors a massive 4-blob incorrectly across rows 2-7, while expected has isolated 2's; row14 has 4's where expected has 2's; row15 has mixed 1/4 where expected has 2's—unknown why connectivity differs, but possibly scan order merges non-blobs or misses disconnections.
 * What worked: Basic structure (copy, visit, BFS for components) identifies most >4 areas correctly; top of train1 matches perfectly; no mutation of low values.
 * What didn't: Color assignment order via row-major discovery causes cycle mismatches (e.g., a blob discovered 5th gets 1, but expected wants it as 2); no sorting of blobs post-detection, leading to inconsistent prioritization.
 * No unhelpful functions; the provided ones are core but incomplete without blob collection/sorting step (e.g., find all components as lists of positions, sort by min-row or size, then color).
 * extract_objects not present or relevant here (no object extraction needed beyond blobs; don't introduce unless for sorting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from the trains: colors like 3/4/1/2 are assigned in scan order, leading to likely mismatches (e.g., scattered 4's in rows 0-1, a large 3-blob in rows 2-7 that may overconnect, 2's in row7-8 and right-side that could be wrong cycle). Without explicit expected, it visually appears fragmented—e.g., row20 has a solid 2-blob left but isolated 1's/4's right, suggesting incorrect merging or ordering; row23 has 4's misplaced amid 1's, unlike train patterns. It doesn't make sense as a "correct" puzzle solution because trains show the program consistently miscolors later blobs (e.g., assigning 2 where 1 expected), so test likely does the same for its >4 clusters. To fix, collect all blobs first (e.g., as list of (size, min_r, min_c, cells)), sort by (min_r, min_c) or size descending, then assign cycle colors in that order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where small, pre-colored components using low numbers (1-4) act as "keys" that indicate a specific number of enclosed empty spaces (holes, i.e., regions of 0s fully surrounded by the component and not connected to the grid border), and larger components made of high numbers (>4) must be recolored to match the color of the low key that has the same number of holes as the high component encloses. The goal is to process the input grid, identify and analyze low components to build a mapping from hole counts to colors, then apply that mapping to recolor high components while leaving low components (1-4) and empty space (0) unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components (1-4) are connected groups of the same color; they are not recolored and serve only as keys—each is analyzed for its own enclosed holes (counting isolated 0-regions inside it, via flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space).
 * High components (>4) are connected groups of cells >4; they are recolored based on the hole count they enclose (similar flood-fill for holes), mapping to the color of a matching low key; if no match, default to 0.
 * Hole counting is tricky: it requires treating the component as a barrier, flood-filling from all border cells (edges of the grid) through non-barrier, non-visited 0s to mark "exterior" space; any remaining unvisited 0s inside are holes, but only count isolated 0-components (not single cells necessarily, but full connected 0-regions fully enclosed).
 * Mapping from holes to color: not all low components with the same hole count are equivalent; the code sorts low components by size descending, then min_r ascending, then min_c ascending, and takes the first (largest/top-left) for each unique hole count— this may be incorrect if the puzzle intends positional matching, shape similarity, or another tiebreaker (e.g., color order or exact position relative to high components).
 * Grid is 30x30 (inferred from outputs), with many 0s; components don't wrap around edges; directions are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Subtle: In count_holes, the initial flood-fill from borders marks exterior 0s, but the hole counting loop then iterates all cells and flood-fills remaining 0s, incrementing hole_count per such isolated 0-component (not per cell, which the code does correctly via inner while loop).
 * Easy to miss: High components might enclose holes that include low components or other highs? But code treats all non-barrier as traversable for exterior fill, and only counts enclosed 0s as holes—lows (1-4) are not 0s, so they block or are ignored in hole counting; ensure visited prevents recounting.
 * Another subtlety: If multiple low components have the same hole count, the mapping overwrites with the last one in sorted order (code uses if h not in mapping, so first in sorted list wins); this caused mismatches in examples where expected uses a different low color for the same holes.
 * Components must be 4-connected; flood_fill uses BFS with stack=deque popleft.
 * 0s on borders are always exterior; fully internal 0s only count as holes if enclosed by the specific component being analyzed (isolated from borders via that barrier).
 * Low components might have holes themselves, which defines their key value; high components' holes are computed similarly but relative to their own shape.
 * Potential edge case: Components touching borders have no "enclosed" holes from border 0s; zero-hole highs might map to a low with zero holes, or default 0.
 * Copy_grid preserves input for output; only modify high cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for creating a modifiable output grid without altering input.)

```python
def flood_fill_low(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # BFS to find connected component of exact color (1-4); returns cells if matching, else [].
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    if g[sr][sc] != color:
        return []
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    cells = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.popleft()
        if g[x][y] != color:
            continue

            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(Helpful for extracting low components accurately.)

```python

(This is mostly helpful for hole counting, but subtle bug: initial border flood doesn't restrict to 0s—it floods through any non-barrier cells (e.g., other lows or highs), which might incorrectly mark internal non-0s as exterior; should probably only flood through 0s for exterior, and ensure holes only count 0s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly identifies and extracts low/high components via flood-fill and computes holes for them.
 * What worked: Low components are found and sorted; mapping is built per unique hole count; highs are recolored only if mapping exists; output preserves lows and 0s.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, a high component (likely in rows 8-16, cols 9-12, shaped like a blob with holes) is colored 1 instead of expected 4—probably because multiple lows have the same hole count, and sorting by size/min_r/min_c picked the wrong (smaller or lower-positioned) low as the key; e.g., a size-3 '1' component overrode a size-? '4' with matching holes.
 * In training example 1, another high (rows 26-29, cols 17-20) is colored 1 but expected 4—same mapping issue, where expected uses '4' keys for these hole counts, suggesting tiebreaker should prioritize color value, position near the high, or reverse sorting.
 * In training example 2, highs in rows 1-7 cols 18-29 are colored 1 but expected 2—again, mapping picked wrong low (likely a '1' with matching holes over a '2'); another high in rows 9-16 cols 20-29 stays 3? but expected has 3s there? Wait, 3 is low, but output shows some recoloring to 1 where expected 2.
 * Sorting low_comps by (-size, min_r, min_c) works for prioritizing large/top-left, but fails when puzzle expects smallest/bottom-right or color-based priority (e.g., higher color number wins).
 * count_holes seems to overcount or mis-mark exterior if it floods non-0s; in ex1, this might lead to wrong hole counts for lows, causing bad mapping.
 * find_low_components correctly skips 0 and >4, but doesn't handle if lows touch highs.
 * Overall, partial understanding: component extraction and basic mapping work, but tiebreaking for duplicate hole counts and potential flood-fill traversal (through non-0s) break it.
 * No prior attempts, but this one shows the approach is close but needs mapping refinement (e.g., sort by color desc instead of size? or per-high position-based matching).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-relies on color 1 for many high components (e.g., rows 0-7 cols 9-11 and 24-25 are 1s, rows 8-14 cols 0-2 and 8-11 are 1s, rows 17-29 col 24 are all 1s), while leaving some 4-patterns unchanged (rows 17-29 cols 26-28), suggesting the mapping heavily favors '1' keys due to sorting picking them for common hole counts.
 * Expected test output is unknown (no expected provided), but based on training patterns, it likely needs more varied colors (e.g., 2,3,4 for different highs); the uniform 1s indicate same mapping flaw as training—probably all highs have 0-1 holes, mapped to a single '1' low.
 * The 4s in rows 17-29 cols 26-28 remain (as they are <=4, lows are preserved), but surrounding highs are 1s where they might expect 4 or other; a complex high blob in rows 19-29 cols 9-28 (with internal 0s and 4-patterns) is partially 1 and partially unchanged 4/0, but looks like it encloses multiple holes, so should be a single color—output fragments it incorrectly.
 * Hole counting likely wrong for this test's irregular shapes (e.g., the bottom high has protrusions and internal 4s, which might be treated as barriers or not, leading to under/over-count); output doesn't unify the large bottom structure into one color.
 * Test makes partial sense (recolors some highs to 1, keeps lows), but fails to vary colors, suggesting broken mapping/tiebreaker; without input grid, hard to verify exact holes, but differences from training imply same issue.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected regions (blobs) of cells with values greater than 4 must be identified using 4-connectivity flood fill, sorted by their top-left position (minimum row then minimum column), and recolored in a cycling sequence of colors [4, 3, 2, 1], while preserving all cells with values <=4 unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are defined strictly as 4-connected components (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) of cells strictly >4; cells ==4 or <=4 are barriers and not part of any blob.
 * Preserve all original values for cells <=4 exactly; do not modify them under any circumstances.
 * Find all such blobs without any size threshold (even single cells >4 count as blobs).
 * Sorting must be by the top-left corner of each blob: primary key is minimum row index (min_r, ascending), secondary key is minimum column index (min_c, ascending) among the blob's cells—this ensures left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
 * Color assignment cycles through [4, 3, 2, 1] based on the sorted order of blobs (first blob gets 4, second gets 3, etc., wrapping around); all cells in a blob get the same color.
 * Copy the grid before modifications to avoid mutating the input.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may be non-contiguous in appearance due to <=4 cells separating them, but flood fill must correctly group only adjacent >4 cells; misidentifying blob boundaries (e.g., treating separated >4 cells as one blob) leads to errors.
 * Another subtlety: In complex grids, blobs might interleave or have irregular shapes, so min_r/min_c calculation must accurately reflect the bounding top-left without including non-blob cells.
 * No diagonal connectivity; ensure flood fill uses only orthogonal directions.
 * The program ignores cells <=4 during blob finding but must output them unchanged in the final grid.
 * Potential miss: If multiple blobs have the same min_r, the min_c tiebreaker is crucial for correct ordering, which can swap color assignments.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid to avoid mutating the original."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is helpful for safe grid manipulation.)

```python
def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Perform flood fill to find connected component of cells >4 using 4-connectivity."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    blob = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.popleft()
        if visited[r][c]:
            continue
        visited[r][c] = True
        if g[r][c] <= 4:
            continue
        blob.append((r, c))
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and g[nr][nc] > 4:
                stack.append((nr, nc))
    return blob
```
(This flood fill is mostly helpful for identifying 4-connected blobs but skips adding cells <=4 correctly; it's broken in that it starts from a >4 cell but may not handle edge cases where initial cells are isolated.)

```python
def find_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Find all connected components of cells >4, ignoring size threshold."""
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs: List[Dict[str, any]] = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                blob_cells = flood_fill(g, r, c, visited)
                if blob_cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in blob_cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in blob_cells)
                    blobs.append({
                        'cells': blob_cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': len(blob_cells)
                    })
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for enumerating all blobs and computing their top-left positions; the visited matrix prevents double-counting, and min_r/min_c calculation is correct for sorting keys.)

(The main program function integrates these but fails due to incorrect blob identification or sorting application in complex cases; no unhelpful functions were introduced, but the overall integration assumes perfect blob detection, which it doesn't achieve.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly preserves all cells <=4 unchanged across both training examples and the test output, which matches expectations.
 * Blob detection via flood fill works for simple, isolated blobs (e.g., the top horizontal blobs in row 1-3 of train1 are correctly identified and colored as 4,3,1,2).
 * Sorting by (min_r, min_c) is implemented correctly in principle, leading to proper left-to-right ordering for blobs in the same row.
 * Color cycling [4,3,2,1] is applied per blob, which is right, but the cycle restarts correctly only if blob count is handled modulo 4.
 * Train1 mismatches: In rows 11-16, generated has a large 2-colored blob where expected has 1's (e.g., row11 col20-25: generated 2's vs expected 1's), and row12 col12-13 has 4's vs expected nothing specific but part of a shifted blob; also row17 has 4's in col5 where expected 3's—likely due to misgrouped blobs treating separate >4 regions as one, causing wrong min_r/min_c and color shift (unknown exact cause, but flood fill may over-connect).
 * Train1 also mismatches in rows 20-25: generated has 3's and 2's swapped or misplaced (e.g., row20 col3-6: generated 3's vs expected 3's but row21 col12-16: generated 2's vs expected 2's in different positions), and row26 is all 0's in generated but expected has 1's—suggests some blobs entirely missed or miscolored.
 * Train2 mismatches: Top blobs in rows1-3 colored correctly as 2,3,1 but row2 col18-27 has 4's in generated vs expected 2's, indicating a large horizontal blob misidentified or wrong color from sorting error; rows4-6 have 4's extending too far right (col13-28 generated 4's vs expected 2's), likely over-grouping a vertical/horizontal structure; lower rows (e.g., row23-29) have fragmented 3's and 2's where expected has consolidated 3's, pointing to flood fill not connecting adjacent >4 cells properly.
 * Overall, the attempt fails on irregular or interleaved blobs, leading to wrong grouping (e.g., separate components treated as one, shifting colors downstream); preserves structure but colors are off by 1-2 in cycle for later blobs.
 * No broken functions per se, but flood_fill is not robust to dense >4 areas where boundaries are subtle.

**Test output:**
 * The test output follows the program's logic by preserving <=4 cells (e.g., all 0's and 1's in original positions remain), identifying some blobs (e.g., top-left 3's in rows2-7 seem grouped correctly as one blob colored 3), and applying colors in approximate top-to-bottom order (4's appear in multiple scattered places like row1 col9-11, row5 col20-22, suggesting cycling).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Blobs appear over-fragmented or under-connected (e.g., the large structure of >4 in rows2-7 cols1-8 is partially 3's but breaks into smaller pieces with 0's interrupting, whereas a single flood fill should connect them fully if adjacent >4; similarly, row10-16 has mixed 3's and 4's that seem like one vertical blob split incorrectly, leading to duplicate colors where one consolidated color is expected). Colors cycle but skip or repeat oddly (e.g., multiple 4-blobs without enough intervening 3/2/1, suggesting sorting missed some blobs or min_r/min_c calculated wrong for interleaved shapes). Bottom rows (24-29) have 4's and 1's that look like misordered blobs compared to top-heavy focus. Overall, it partially makes sense for simple blobs but fails on complex connectivity, likely producing wrong output similar to trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where low-value connected components (numbers 1-4, representing colored shapes) are analyzed to create a mapping from the number of enclosed holes (regions of 0s fully surrounded by the component) to a color (1-4). High-value connected components (>4, representing uncolored or placeholder shapes) are then recolored according to this mapping based on their own hole counts, effectively "solving" the puzzle by applying the learned color-hole association consistently across the grid while preserving low components and empty space (0s).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count for connectivity.
 * Holes are strictly enclosed regions of 0s that are fully surrounded by a single component's cells and cannot reach the grid border via adjacent 0s—use a flood fill from borders to mark reachable 0s as non-holes, then count remaining isolated 0-regions within the component's bounding area.
 * Low components (1-4) are never modified; only high components (>4) are recolored, and only if their hole count matches a key in the mapping (otherwise, default to 0 or leave unchanged? but examples suggest mapping to the correct color or 0).
 * Mapping creation: Hole-to-color association should be based on low components, but subtleties include prioritizing components by size (largest first), then position (top-most, then left-most) to resolve ties—do not overwrite mappings for the same hole count; take the "primary" one.
 * Grid borders are always accessible for hole detection; components touching borders cannot enclose holes on that side.
 * 0s are background/empty; they can form holes only if isolated by the component (not connected to outer space).
 * Subtle: Hole counting must treat the component as a barrier, but only count 0s inside its "interior"—avoid counting external 0s or 0s in other components.
 * Components may be irregular shapes (e.g., with bays or protrusions), so hole detection needs robust flood fill to avoid false positives (e.g., U-shapes don't enclose holes).
 * Mapping is one-way: multiple low components might have the same hole count, but only one defines the color for that hole value (based on sorting criteria); high components use this lookup.
 * Preserve all original low (1-4) and 0 cells exactly; only overwrite >4 cells.
 * Edge case: Components with 0 holes map to a color if defined; undefined hole counts for high components should map to 0 (per code, but examples suggest specific colors).
 * Subtle: In hole counting for high components, use the original grid (not modified), and barriers are only the high component's cells—low components or other highs don't block unless adjacent.
 * Grid size is consistent (30x30? from outputs), but assume variable; no wrapping around edges.

(Extracts low components and builds mapping; sorting priority seems correct based on examples, but may need validation if ties cause wrong color picks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided uses a solid structure for component finding and hole counting, correctly identifying low components and applying mapping to high ones.
 * What worked: Flood fill accurately groups same-color cells; hole counting correctly uses border flood to exclude reachable 0s and counts isolated 0-groups as separate holes; mapping avoids duplicates by checking 'if h not in mapping'.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated output assigns color 1 to a high component (rows 8-16, cols 10-12) that should be 4 (expected shows 4s there, e.g., row 8: positions 10-11 as 4,4; generated has 1,1); similarly, row 27: generated has 1s where expected has 4s. This suggests wrong mapping lookup—possibly hole count miscomputed for that high component (e.g., counted 0 holes but mapped to 1 instead of 4) or sorting picked wrong low component for holes=0 or whatever value it has.
 * In training example 1, another mismatch: row 27-30 expected has a large 4-block in cols 17+, but generated has scattered 1s (e.g., row 27: 1,1,1 at cols 17-19); this indicates the high component there was assigned 1 instead of 4, likely same mapping/hole error.
 * In training example 2, generated assigns 1 to large high components (e.g., rows 2-6, cols 14-24 should be 2 per expected, but generated has 1s in places like row 2 cols 18-19); expected has 2s there. Also, row 9 cols 10-12 generated 1,1,1 but expected 2,2,2. Hole counts likely wrong (e.g., that component has 0 holes but mapped to wrong color).
 * Overall, low components are preserved correctly in both trainings (e.g., top shapes in 1-4 unchanged), but high recoloring fails consistently, suggesting bug in count_holes for high components (perhaps barriers not isolating properly, or flooding includes low components' 0s incorrectly) or mapping not capturing all hole values (e.g., missing holes=0 or holes=1 mappings).
 * Sorting in mapping seems to prioritize correctly (largest first), but if multiple low components have same holes and sizes, min_r/min_c tiebreaker may pick wrong "representative" color.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (flood_fill_same, count_holes, etc.) are relevant and mostly correct, but count_holes for high may over/under-count holes due to interaction with low components (e.g., shared 0s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it assigns 1 to several high components (e.g., rows 0-7 cols 9-11: 1s where input likely has >4, but without input grid, assuming similar to trainings, this should be a different color like 2 or 3 based on holes; also rows 17-29 cols 24+: all 1s, but scattered 4s remain in lower right, suggesting incomplete recoloring).
 * It leaves some original >4 values (e.g., 4s in rows 17-29 cols 26-29) unchanged instead of mapping them, which mismatches the rule— all >4 should be replaced by mapping.get(holes, 0), but here it seems to only partially apply (e.g., row 17 col 26: 4 remains, but nearby 1s applied).
 * Upper left low components (1s in rows 0-3,8-14 cols 9-11,24) are preserved correctly, but the large high structure in rows 17-29 (with internal 0s and 4s) is partially 1s and partially unchanged 4s, indicating hole count failed to group the entire component or mapping defaulted wrong (e.g., if holes=0 maps to 1, but some subparts not flooded properly).
 * Does not make sense overall: Expected test output should have consistent recoloring (e.g., the big lower high component likely has 1 hole or 0, mapping to 2 or 3, not mixed 1 and 4); current output has fragmented application, suggesting bug in find_all_high_components (e.g., not grouping all >4 together if they touch via 0s? but code uses g[nx][ny] >4 strictly).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where 0 represents empty space, 1-4 represent "low" colored regions (connected components of the exact same value), and values >4 represent "high" uncolored regions (connected components regardless of specific high value). The goal is to preserve low regions, analyze them to create a mapping from the number of enclosed "holes" (isolated 0-regions fully surrounded by a component and not reachable from the grid border) to a specific color (1-4), and then recolor each high region with the color from the mapping based on its own enclosed hole count (defaulting to 0 if no mapping exists), while leaving all other cells (0s and low regions) unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components (1-4) are strictly 4-connected (up/down/left/right) and must share the exact same value to be part of the same component; different values (e.g., 1 adjacent to 2) are separate even if touching.
 * High components (>4) are also 4-connected but can include any high values (e.g., 5 and 6 can connect); they are not restricted to the same value.
 * Holes are defined as connected components of 0-cells that are fully enclosed by a specific component (low or high) and cannot be reached from the grid border via other 0-cells; this requires a flood-fill from the border to mark "exterior" 0s, then counting separate unvisited 0-components inside the barrier formed by the component's cells.
 * The mapping from holes to color is derived only from low components: for each hole count, select the highest color (1-4) among all low components that have that exact hole count; if multiple low components share a hole count, the max color wins for that hole count in the mapping.
 * Preserve all low (1-4) and 0 cells unchanged in the output; only recolor high (>4) cells.
 * Edge cases: Components touching the border may have 0 exterior holes; single-cell components have 0 holes; holes must be strictly enclosed (no path to border through 0s); avoid counting exterior 0s as holes; ensure deep copying to prevent mutating input.
 * Subtlety: The count_holes function must treat the component cells as "barriers" but allow 0-paths around them only if not enclosed; border flooding must carefully enqueue all border 0s without duplication (e.g., corners).
 * Another subtlety: If no low component has a certain hole count, high components with that hole count default to 0 (blank).
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); assume valid input with 0 <= values, but focus on 0,1-4,>4.
 * Potential miss: Overcounting holes if flood-fill leaks through non-barrier high/low cells; undercounting if border flood misses diagonal touches (but 4-connected only).
 * The puzzle emphasizes "enclosed" holes, so partial enclosures (e.g., open to border) don't count; this is key for irregular shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core structure (identifying low/high components via flood-fill, computing holes, mapping, and recoloring only highs) worked well for preserving low regions (1-4) and 0s unchanged, as seen in the top sections of both training examples matching expected.
 * Low component detection (flood_fill_same) correctly identified separate components by exact color, e.g., the 1,2,3,4 blobs in train1 rows 1-3 are preserved identically in generated vs. expected.
 * Border flooding in count_holes partially worked, as some enclosed holes seem correctly identified (e.g., no overcounting of exterior 0s), but the final hole count per component led to wrong mappings.
 * High component detection (flood_fill_high) worked for grouping >4 cells regardless of value, but recoloring failed due to incorrect mapping application.
 * In train1: Generated incorrectly kept many high regions as 4 (e.g., row9 cols3-5: 4,4,4 vs. expected 3,3,3; row10 col2:4 vs.3; row11 col20-25:4s vs. expected 1s) while expected recolored to 3,1,2,4 in specific high blobs; this suggests the mapping assigned max=4 for hole counts that should map to lower colors (e.g., a hole count shared by a 4 and 3 low component took 4, but puzzle may want min, or unique assignment, or color=holes+something; unknown why, but difference is clear in left/mid high blobs).
 * In train1: Some areas correct (e.g., row12 col20-25: expected 1s, but generated has 4s there? Wait, generated row11 has 4s in col20-25, expected 1s; mismatch in enclosure count or max selection).
 * In train1: Bottom rows (e.g., row26-29) generated has scattered 4s where expected has 4s in some places but 0s/1s elsewhere; partial match but wrong for hole-based recoloring (e.g., row27 col16-19: generated 4s vs. expected 4s, good; but row22 col12-15: generated 4s vs. expected 2s).
 * In train2: Top low regions preserved (e.g., rows1-3: 2s and 3s match); but high recoloring wrong, e.g., row2 col18-21: generated 3s vs. expected 2s; row4 col13-25: generated 3s vs. expected 2s; row9 col10-17: generated 3s vs. expected 2s in some parts; suggests over-assignment of 3 (perhaps max color bias for hole=1 or similar).
 * In train2: Later rows worse, e.g., row10 col20-29: generated 3s vs. expected 3s in parts but 0s elsewhere; row15 col1 and col8-17: generated 3s vs. expected 2s; consistent error in mapping favoring higher colors.
 * build_hole_to_color_mapping uses max(color) per hole count, which seems logical but fails both trainings (always picks highest, leading to over-coloring with 3/4 instead of expected 1/2); this is likely the main bug—consider if puzzle wants the color of the low component with that hole count, assuming unique, or min, or sorted assignment.
 * count_holes counts number of hole components (good), but may under/overcount if barriers don't fully enclose (e.g., if high/low cells don't block all paths); in train1, a blob with expected 1-hole colored 3 but generated as 4 suggests wrong hole count or mapping.
 * apply_color_to_cells is correct and helpful for output modification.
 * find_high_components and find_all_low_components are helpful and mostly correct, but depend on flood-fills.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though count_holes border enqueue has minor duplication risk (but didn't cause observed errors).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it largely preserves original high values (many 4s and scattered 1s) without evident recoloring based on holes, similar to training mismatches (e.g., large connected 4-regions in rows 2-6 cols1-8 remain 4s, but if they enclose different holes, should recolor to 1-3 per mapping; row20 cols0-7: all 4s, likely a high component that should be recolored if holes match a low-derived mapping).
 * It includes unexpected 1s in a vertical strip (col24 across rows0-29), which may be a misidentified low component or wrong preservation, but expected should preserve only original 1s (if any) and recolor highs; this strip looks like over-preservation or bug in component detection.
 * Scattered 4s in bottom rows (e.g., row29 cols6-15: 4s) suggest incomplete recoloring; without expected, it doesn't align with training patterns where highs get 1/2/3 based on holes (e.g., enclosed blobs should not stay 4).
 * Overall, it fails to show systematic hole-based recoloring (e.g., no clear shift to 2s or 3s in enclosed areas), indicating the mapping or hole-count is still broken for irregular test shapes; account for complex enclosures (e.g., multi-hole high components) and ensure unique hole-to-color (no max if conflicts).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components where small "key" shapes (colored 1-4, exactly 3 rows high) encode color mappings via the number of enclosed holes (internal 0's not connected to the border), and larger "orange" blobs (high values, potentially including 4) are recolored to match the key color associated with their own enclosed hole count, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be connected components of the same color (1-4) with exact height 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); taller or shorter components are ignored, even if they visually resemble keys (e.g., a full-height vertical line of 1's is one component of height 30, not multiple keys).
 * Holes are strictly internal 0's disconnected from the grid border; the count_holes function uses BFS from border non-barrier cells to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unmarked 0's inside the shape—subtlety: barriers are only the component cells themselves, so adjacent 0's outside the component but enclosed by it count as holes if not border-connected.
 * Multiple keys with the same hole count: select the "best" (smallest min_r, then smallest min_c) to map hole count to a single color; if no key for a blob's hole count, set blob to 0.
 * Blobs are connected components of high values (code assumes >4 for "orange"), but subtlety: in the test case, values are exactly 4, suggesting blobs may include ==4; unconnected or isolated high cells aren't blobs.
 * Grid is copied before modification to avoid altering input; directions for connectivity are 4-way (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical or irregular key shapes may span height >3 if connected, breaking key detection; hole counting ignores the blob/key color value (treats as barrier) but requires grid[r][c]==0 for internal cells; border enqueue in count_holes has redundancy (corners enqueued twice) but works; if no components, output is unchanged copy.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but it assumes fixed height=3 for keys (may not generalize if keys vary); blob detection misses ==4; no handling for keys/blobs overlapping or touching borders in ways that affect hole counting; potential for 0-hole keys to map blobs with 0 enclosures.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (both passed, likely due to keys being height 3 and blobs >4).
 * Missed detecting keys in test case: vertical line of 1's forms single component height ~30 !=3, so no key_components found, no hole-to-color mapping created.
 * find_orange_blobs is broken for test case: searches for >4, but test has patterns of exactly 4, so no blobs processed; output is effectively unchanged copy of input (1's and 4's remain, rest 0's).
 * count_holes and find_key_components are helpful and correct for their logic, but unused in test due to upstream failures.
 * No prior attempts to note, but this attempt assumes fixed blob threshold >4 (not general); height==3 is rigid and misses tall keys; mapping uses min position for ties (worked in training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 30x30 grid with a full vertical column of 1's (column index 24, all rows), unchanged, and repeating patterns of 4's in rows 17-28 (columns 26-28, forming what looks like 6 vertical "E"-like or barred shapes, each 3 rows high with internal 0's), also unchanged, surrounded by 0's everywhere else.
 * This does not look correct: No recoloring occurred, suggesting the program failed to identify the 4-patterns as blobs (because ==4, not >4) or find matching keys (1's too tall for height==3 check); expected output should recolor the 4-blobs to some color 1-4 based on their enclosed holes matching a key's holes, or to 0, but instead it's static—likely the vertical 1's are meant as multiple stacked keys or a different detection rule, and 4's are the target blobs; difference is total lack of modification, which mismatches puzzle goal of transforming blobs via keys (unknown exact expected colors, but output should differ visibly in the 4 areas).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where "legend" shapes (connected components of colors 1-4 that are rectangular/large enough) define a mapping from the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") within them to their color. Orange blobs (connected regions of values >4) are then recolored based on matching their own hole count to this mapping, or set to 0 if no match, effectively classifying unknown orange shapes by their topological similarity (hole count) to known legends.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are only valid connected components (4-directional adjacency) of the same color from 1-4 that span more than one row and one column (height >1 and width >1), excluding single cells or lines.
 * Holes are fully enclosed regions of 0's (background) that are not connected to the grid border; the count_holes function correctly implements a flood-fill from borders to mark exterior space, then counts separate connected components of unvisited 0's as distinct holes.
 * Mapping from hole count to color takes the first encountered legend for each unique hole count (sorted by position), so order matters and duplicates aren't handled—could overwrite if not careful, but code avoids it by checking "if h not in mapping".
 * Orange blobs (>4, connected 4-directionally) are recolored entirely to the mapped color if their hole count matches a legend's, or to 0 otherwise; non-orange regions (0-4) remain unchanged.
 * Subtlety: Hole counting treats the component's cells as barriers, but only counts enclosed 0's—other colors inside aren't considered holes, and the flood-fill ensures only truly enclosed areas are counted.
 * Grid is 30x30 based on outputs; assumes rectangular grid with no wrapping.
 * Potential miss: If a legend or blob touches the border, its "holes" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0; also, diagonal connections don't count (only orthogonal).
 * In mapping, only legends contribute; single-color lines or small shapes aren't legends, so ignored.
 * For blobs, if hole count doesn't match any legend, set to 0 (erasing the orange), which might be a way to "remove" unmatched unknowns.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of legends by (min_r, min_c) ensures consistent mapping order, preventing position-based variability.

(Combines legends and hole counting into mapping.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) submission provided; it correctly solved training example 1, indicating solid understanding of legend extraction, hole counting, and mapping application for simple cases.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output colored the large central shape (around rows 2-6, cols 13-23) entirely as 1's, but expected 2's; also left some small areas (e.g., row 1 cols 18-19 as 1's instead of 2's, row 9 cols 10-12 as 1's instead of 2's) mismatched, and bottom orange blobs (rows 19-29, various cols) have partial recoloring (some 3's remain or are wrong, e.g., row 20 cols 20-21 as 3's but expected partial 3's with 2's nearby? Wait, differences are scattered—e.g., row 9 col 10-12: generated 1's vs expected 2's; row 15 col 21-22: generated 3's vs expected 0's? Unknown exact cause, but likely miscomputed hole count for the central blob or wrong legend mapping due to multiple legends with overlapping hole counts).
 * What worked: Legend detection and basic BFS for components/holes seems robust (passed train1); mapping logic applies correctly when hole counts are unique/simple.
 * What didn't: In train2, the central blob was treated as having a hole count matching color 1's legend instead of 2's, suggesting either wrong hole count (e.g., overcounting/underCounting enclosures due to barrier setup) or mapping overwrite/selection error from sorting; also, some orange sub-blobs weren't fully recolored, leaving 3's where expected 2's or 0's.
 * count_holes is helpful and seems correct (no issues in train1), but may fail if component cells don't fully barrier internal 0's (e.g., if legend has internal non-0 but code only barriers the legend cells).
 * find_orange_blobs is helpful but in train2 didn't group all connected >4 properly, leading to partial coloring.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet—all provided seem relevant, though get_legends wrapper is just a filter and could be inlined.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It introduces a vertical column of 1's (column 24, rows 0-29) where the input likely had 0's or empty space, suggesting erroneous detection of a "legend" or blob there (possibly misreading a thin vertical structure as a legend with holes mapping to 1, or a bug in component finding treating border/empty as component).
 * The bottom orange regions (rows 18-29, cols 25-28 with 4's, likely >4 in input but shown as 4's—wait, code treats >4 as orange, but output leaves most 4's unchanged, indicating either input has exactly 4 (treated as legend, not blob) or bug in find_orange_blobs (if values=4 not >4, they stay as-is, but expected recoloring suggests they should be blobs—possible subtlety: input may use 5+ for orange, but output shows 4's untouched, meaning no recoloring happened, wrong if they match a hole mapping).
 * Upper grid is all 0's except the spurious 1's column, implying no legends/blobs detected in top (possibly correct if test has isolated elements), but the unchanged 4's in bottom suggest failure to identify them as recolorable blobs (e.g., if they are connected but hole count doesn't match, should be 0's, not left as 4's—output has them as 4's with some 0's inside, indicating no processing).
 * Overall, test output makes little sense: Spurious 1's column is an artifact (likely false positive component), and lack of recoloring on bottom 4's/0's mix means blobs weren't processed or mapped (expected probably to color bottom blobs to a legend color like 1-3 based on holes, but instead partial original values remain); this highlights a bug in threshold (>4) or hole computation for test's topology.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with legend shapes (small connected components of colors 1-4 that span exactly 3 rows in height) and larger blob shapes (connected regions to be colored). The goal is to color each blob uniformly using the color from the h-th legend (sorted by position), where h is the number of enclosed holes (isolated connected 0-regions inside the blob, treating the blob as a barrier), if h is less than the number of legends; otherwise, clear the blob to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Legends are connected components of the same color (1-4) with a bounding box height exactly 3 (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3); they are not necessarily vertical bars but any connected shape spanning exactly 3 rows vertically; only these are collected and sorted by (min_r, min_c) for indexing.
 * Blobs are connected components of cells >4 (using 4-directional connectivity); the program assumes unknowns are marked >4, but this misses cases where blobs use colors 1-4 (e.g., test uses 4 for the blob).
 * Hole counting treats blob cells as barriers: flood-fill from grid borders through non-barrier (non-blob) cells to mark exterior space (including 0s and other non-blobs); then, each separate connected component of unvisited 0s inside the barriers counts as one hole (not per cell, but per enclosed region).
 * Output starts as a copy of input; only blobs are modified (colored or cleared); legends and other cells (e.g., tall components of 1-4, background 0s) remain unchanged.
 * Subtle: Legends must be exactly height 3; taller or shorter connected 1-4 components (like the test's full-height 1 column or 11-row 4 blob) are ignored as legends and not treated as blobs if <=4, leaving them unchanged—which can produce incorrect outputs if such components are meant to be the blobs.
 * Subtle: Hole flood-fill starts only from border cells (top/bottom rows fully, left/right columns); interior non-0 non-blobs might affect enclosure if not handled, but code marks all reachable non-barrier from borders.
 * Subtle: If no legends (len(legends)==0), all blobs get h < 0 false, so cleared to 0 regardless of holes.
 * Subtle: Multiple blobs are processed independently; each gets its own hole count relative to global legends list.
 * Consideration: Grid is rectangular (e.g., 30x30 in test); assumes uniform size; 0 is background/empty, but only 0s count as potential holes (non-0 interiors don't count as holes).
 * Consideration: Connected components use BFS (deque stack, but popleft makes it BFS); 4 directions (orthogonal, no diagonals).
 * Easy to miss: The test blob (4s) encloses holes (e.g., the 0s in column 27, rows 18,20,etc., might form enclosed regions if treated as blob); visually, the 4 pattern looks like stacked "E" or bars with gaps, likely having 1+ holes per section, but code doesn't process it.
 * Easy to miss: If blobs touch borders, their "interior" might connect to exterior, reducing hole count to 0.
 * Across attempts: Only this one attempt shown; assumes prior ones led here, but focuses on >4 blobs working for training but failing when blobs reuse 1-4 colors.

    # ... (full code as provided)

(Flood-fills exterior from borders treating component as barriers, then counts connected 0-components in interior; accurate for enclosure but assumes 0s only for holes and component fully encloses; helpful and correct in logic, but depends on correct blob detection.)

```python

    # ... (full code as provided)
```
(Orchestrates: copy, find legends, find blobs, color each blob based on holes vs. legends index; works end-to-end for >4 blobs but fails when blobs are <=4.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identified and colored blobs in training examples 1 and 2, where blobs were likely marked >4 and hole counts matched legend indexing properly.
 * Failed to detect the test blob (connected 4s, height 11) as it uses color 4 (<=4 and not height 3), so treated as neither legend nor blob—left unchanged as 4s, producing output with uncolored blob structure.
 * The tall vertical 1s (height 30) were not detected as legend (height !=3) and not blob (<=4), so left as 1s—likely correct if it's a non-colorable element, but unclear without expected output.
 * No legends detected in test (only height-3 qualify, and neither 1s nor 4s match), so even if blobs were found, they'd clear to 0; but since no blobs, nothing changes.
 * find_blobs is helpful for >4 but broken/not general for test (misses 1-4 blobs); don't use as-is—extend to connected components excluding height-3 legends.
 * count_holes is essential and correct for hole logic, but unhelpful without proper blob extraction.
 * find_legends is essential for color keys but too narrow (only height==3); misses if test has no such legends.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond narrow blob detection; copy_grid and component finding (BFS) are solid tools to reuse.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it retains the full input structure—a vertical column of 1s (column 24, all 30 rows) and a connected blob of 4s (columns 26-28, rows 17-27, forming a pattern with internal 0s like stacked bars/gaps)—without any coloring or clearing of the 4 blob, suggesting no blobs were detected or processed.
 * Expected: The 4 structure should be treated as a blob, its internal 0s (e.g., isolated in column 27) counted as holes (likely 5-6 separate hole regions from the pattern), then colored uniformly to a legend color (but no legends found, so probably cleared to 0) or perhaps to 1 if the tall 1s are misinterpreted; the output keeping 4s means the blob wasn't handled, leaving visible "unknown" regions.
 * The vertical 1s remain, which might be correct (not a blob/legend), but the overall output looks like an unchanged input with no puzzle resolution—blobs should be resolved to 1-4 or 0.
 * No >4 visible, confirming blob detection failed; the pattern suggests 1-2 holes per "E"-like section (gaps enclosed if blob is barrier), but unprocessed so unknown exact h; output differs from expected by not unifying the 4s to a single color/0.
 * Make sure to account for blobs using 1-4 colors (not just >4) and potentially no height-3 legends (e.g., use tall 1s as color source?) to handle test case.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based components where small "key" shapes (connected regions of the same color 1-4 spanning exactly 3 rows) are identified, and their properties (like enclosed hole counts) are used to assign colors to larger connected components (regions of cells >=4) based on matching enclosed hole counts; unmatched large components are cleared to 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Keys must be exactly 3 rows high (max_r - min_r + 1 == 3), connected via same-color (1-4) flood fill, and are sorted by their top-left position (min_r, then min_c).
 * Hole counting is not the total number of 0-cells enclosed by a component, but the number of distinct connected components of enclosed 0-cells (i.e., separate "holes" not reachable from the grid border, treating the component cells as barriers); this is computed by flooding from borders to mark reachable non-barrier cells, then counting and flooding each remaining connected group of 0 non-barrier cells.
 * Large components are connected regions of cells >=4; they are skipped (left unchanged) only if exactly 3 rows high and all cells exactly 4 (not higher); otherwise, if their hole count indexes into the list of keys (h < len(keys)), the entire component is recolored to the matching key's color; if h >= len(keys), set to 0.
 * Components with values <=4 (but not exactly 3-high all-4) are not treated as "large" since flood_fill_ge4 only includes >=4; low-value components (<=3) are ignored for recoloring unless they form keys.
 * Border flooding for holes must avoid barriers (the component cells) and only considers 0-cells as potential holes; non-0 non-barrier cells (e.g., other colors) are treated as reachable but not counted as holes.
 * Vertical or irregular shapes may lead to miscomputed heights or connections; ensure flood fills respect exact connectivity (4-directional).
 * If no keys exist or hole counts exceed available keys, large components default to 0, potentially clearing much of the grid.
 * Subtle: In hole counting, the initial border enqueue includes only non-barrier border cells, and the hole scan only increments for unvisited 0 non-barrier cells, ensuring enclosed 0-components are counted separately even if adjacent but separated by barriers elsewhere.
 * Potential miss: Keys' own holes are computed similarly, but since keys are small (3-high), they may enclose 0 or few hole components; large components' holes can be more complex due to size.
 * Ensure grid copying preserves original for output; visited marks prevent reprocessing.

(Essential for extracting and sorting key components; filters to 3-high same-color 1-4 regions and computes their holes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; training examples 1 and 2 both passed correctly, indicating the core logic (key extraction, hole counting as connected components, and large component recoloring) works for those cases.
 * The skipping condition for 3-high all-4 components (not recoloring them) worked for training but may be a subtlety—perhaps all-4 regions are "special" or pre-colored keys/large blobs that should remain.
 * Hole counting as number of connected 0-components (not total 0-cells) appears correct since training passed; total cells might be an easy miss.
 * find_keys correctly ignores non-3-high or >4 color components for keys.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the all_low check (all <=4 in ge4 flood) is tautological for ==4 but ensures skipping pure-4 3-high; if this is wrong for test, it could leave unintended regions unchanged.
 * Potential issue: If input has only low-value keys (like the vertical 1s) and no large >=4 components, output remains mostly unchanged (e.g., just the keys visible).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 30x30 grid (inferred from list lengths) that is entirely 0s except for a single vertical column of 1s (at index 24 in each of the 30 rows), resulting in a thin, unbroken line of 1s spanning the full height.
 * This does not look correct for a typical puzzle output, as it suggests minimal processing: likely the input contained these 1s as a connected key component (possibly 3-high segments or full-height, but treated as keys), with the rest as 0s or <4, and no large >=4 components to recolor—leading to an output that is essentially the input unchanged except possibly clearing non-matching areas to 0.
 * Expected output should likely include recolored large regions (e.g., filled areas with colors 1-4 based on holes matching keys), not just an isolated vertical line; the all-0 background with only 1s indicates either no large components in input or a bug in detecting/recoloring them (e.g., if the line is not exactly 3-high per key or holes don't match).
 * Difference from expected: No evidence of hole-based coloring or component filling; if test input has enclosed 0-regions or >=4 blobs, they should appear colored, but here everything else is 0—suggests the program cleared too much or missed components (unknown why, possibly input lacks >=4 or height condition fails broadly).
 * To handle test: Ensure large components aren't skipped incorrectly (e.g., revise skipping only for exact all-4 3-high); verify if vertical keys are split into 3-high segments for multiple keys.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent "heights" or colors; low-height connected components (values 1-4) act as a "key" by associating their colors with the number of enclosed empty (0) regions ("holes") they create, and high-height connected blobs (values >4) are then recolored to match the key color corresponding to the number of holes they similarly enclose, or set to 0 if no match.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Low components are strictly same-value connected groups (4-directional adjacency) for values 1-4; high blobs are any connected >4 cells (regardless of exact value).
 * Holes are the number of distinct connected components of 0-cells that are fully enclosed (not reachable from the grid border via other 0-cells or non-barrier spaces); the component itself acts as a barrier during hole counting.
 * Low components are sorted by descending size, then ascending min_row, then ascending min_col (prioritizing largest, then topmost-leftmost) before building the hole-to-color mapping; only the first (highest-priority) low component per unique hole count is used in the mapping—duplicates are ignored.
 * If a high blob's hole count has no mapping, it defaults to 0 (erased); low components and 0s are never modified.
 * Border flooding in hole counting starts from all border non-barrier cells (including 0s and other non-component cells) to mark all reachable space; enclosed holes are then detected as separate connected 0-components in the unmarked interior.
 * Subtlety: Hole count is per connected 0-region (not total 0-cells), so a large empty area counts as 1 hole if connected.
 * Subtlety: Barriers for hole counting are only the cells of the current component being analyzed—other grid cells (including other components or high/low values) are traversable unless they are the barrier.
 * Subtlety: The grid may have "divider" lines or vertical/horizontal 1s (as seen in test), which could be low components themselves; ensure flood fill doesn't cross value boundaries for low comps.
 * All components must be processed in order, but mapping is global (one per hole count across all low comps).
 * 0s are empty space only for hole detection; they don't form components.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 30x30 in test), so all functions must be dimension-agnostic.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Shallow copy utility; essential for non-destructive output.)

```python
def flood_fill_same(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    cells = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.popleft()
        if g[x][y] != color:
            continue
        cells.append((x, y))
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(Flood fill for same-color low components; returns list of cells. Helpful for extracting exact component boundaries; uses BFS via deque for efficiency.)

(Core hole-counting function; treats component as barrier, floods borders to mark exterior/interior reachable space, then counts connected enclosed 0-regions. Accurate and essential; correctly handles multiple holes per component.)

                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in cells)
                    size = len(cells)
                    num_holes = count_holes(g, cells)
                    components.append({
                        'color': color,

                    })
    return components
```
(Extracts all low components with metadata; uses flood_fill_same and count_holes. Helpful for building the key mapping; includes size/position for sorting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; no prior iterations shown.
 * Successfully handled training examples 1 and 2 completely correctly (full match to expected outputs).
 * For test input, the program correctly identified and left low components (1-4) unchanged, as per rules.
 * Sorting low components by (size desc, min_r asc, min_c asc) and taking first unique hole-to-color mapping worked for training, ensuring consistent key assignment.
 * Hole counting via border flood + enclosed 0-component detection is accurate and handled training cases without issues (no over/under-counting of holes).
 * High blob processing (flood fill any >4, count holes, map to color or 0) was not triggered in test (or mapped to existing low colors), as output shows only 0/1/4.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt—all provided (e.g., flood_fill_same, count_holes) are relevant, correct, and essential; avoid reinventing without need.
 * Potential subtlety missed in general: If test had >4 cells, they should appear as 1-4 or 0 in output based on holes; the code handles this but test output suggests no >4 or all mapped to 1 (e.g., the vertical 1-line and left shapes remain 1s, right 4-shapes remain 4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid with mostly 0s, scattered 1s forming shapes on the left/top (e.g., possible letters/numbers in rows 0-3, 7-14, 17-18) and a vertical line of 1s in column 24 across all rows, plus a complex shape of 4s in the bottom-right (rows 17-29, columns 25-29, forming irregular connected regions with internal 0s).
 * It makes sense as output: Low components (1s and 4s) are unchanged, 0s intact; if test input had >4 cells (e.g., in the right shape or elsewhere), they were correctly replaced (possibly to 1, explaining the 1-line if it was high-mapped). No >4 remains, as expected.
 * However, without the raw test input grid or expected output, it's unclear if mappings were applied correctly (e.g., did the 4-shape enclose holes matching a 1-key? Why not recolored?). The vertical 1-line looks like a persistent low component or mapped high, but the overall structure (left shapes as 1s, right as 4s) suggests correct non-modification of lows. It looks plausible/correct based on rules, but the right 4-shape's internal 0s (visible in rows 20-29) imply it could enclose holes—if it's low (4<=4), holes aren't used for it, but if input had >4 there, output should have recolored based on those holes (e.g., to 1 if mapping[hole_count]=1). Difference: Output retains 4s, which would be wrong if those were high >4 in input (expected recolor to key color); unknown without input, but code would handle it correctly per training success.
 * No obvious errors (e.g., no stray >4, no modified lows), so it aligns with expectations; subtle issue if test has high in 4-positions but output didn't map (but code looks fine).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:03:37] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where low-value connected components (colors 1-4) are analyzed to create a mapping from the number of enclosed "holes" (fully surrounded connected regions of 0s) to their color, prioritizing the largest such components; high-value regions (>4) are then recolored according to the hole count of their own shape using this mapping, while preserving all other grid elements unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right); low components are strictly same-color (1-4), while high components are any cells >4 connected together regardless of exact value.
 * Holes are not simply the count of individual 0 cells inside a component, but the number of distinct connected components of 0s that are fully enclosed (not reachable from the grid borders via other 0s or non-barrier cells); this requires a border-flood to mark exterior/reachable 0s, followed by counting interior connected 0-regions.
 * Mapping from holes to color is built by sorting low components by descending size, then ascending min_r (topmost), then ascending min_c (leftmost), and assigning only the first (largest/earliest) component's color for each unique hole count—subsequent components with the same hole count are ignored, which can lead to wrong mappings if a smaller but "correct" component is overridden.
 * The grid has implicit borders; 0s touching the edge are never holes. Barriers for hole counting are only the cells of the specific component being analyzed (low or high), allowing 0s to "leak" through other parts of the grid unless blocked.
 * Preserve all original low colors (1-4) and 0s unchanged; only modify >4 cells. Components must be non-empty and validly bounded.
 * Subtlety: Hole counting for low components uses the full grid context (other low components can block or allow leakage), but each is analyzed independently as barriers— this might undercount holes if adjacent low components interfere with enclosure. For high components, the same logic applies, but their shapes may enclose 0s differently.
 * Potential miss: If multiple low components have the same hole count, the sorting tiebreaker (position) might select the wrong color; also, if no low component matches a high component's hole count, it defaults to 0 (erasing it), which seems incorrect based on examples.
 * Easy to miss: The output grid is a copy of input, so low areas and isolated >4 cells stay as-is unless part of a high component; also, single-cell high components should still get mapped if they enclose holes (though unlikely for singles).
 * Considerations across attempts: Sorting order affects mapping reliability; hole counting must distinguish connected 0-regions, not total 0s; test cases may have overlapping or adjacent components where leakage matters; ensure flood-fill doesn't cross color boundaries for low, but does for high (>4 only).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for creating an editable output grid without modifying input.)

```python
def flood_fill_same(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # (as provided: correctly flood-fills same-color low components 1-4)
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    if not (0 <= sr < rows and 0 <= sc < cols) or g[sr][sc] != color or visited[sr][sc]:
        return []
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    cells = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                cells.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(This is helpful and correct for extracting low same-color components.)

```python
def flood_fill_high(g: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # (as provided: correctly flood-fills connected >4 high components)
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    if not (0 <= sr < rows and 0 <= sc < cols) or g[sr][sc] <= 4 or visited[sr][sc]:
        return []
    stack = deque([(sr, sc)])
    visited[sr][sc] = True
    cells = [(sr, sc)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] > 4:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                stack.append((nx, ny))
                cells.append((nx, ny))
    return cells
```
(This is helpful and correct for extracting high components.)

```python
def find_all_low_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, int]]:
    # (as provided: correctly finds all low components with size, position, holes)
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if 1 <= g[r][c] <= 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                cells = flood_fill_same(g, r, c, visited, color)
                if cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in cells)
                    size = len(cells)
                    num_holes = count_holes(g, cells)
                    components.append({
                        'color': color,
                        'holes': num_holes,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c,
                        'size': size
                    })
    return components
```
(This is helpful for low component extraction, but relies on potentially buggy count_holes.)

```python
def find_all_high_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    # (as provided: correctly finds all high components)
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] > 4 and not visited[r][c]:
                cells = flood_fill_high(g, r, c, visited)
                if cells:
                    min_r = min(rr for rr, _ in cells)
                    min_c = min(cc for _, cc in cells)
                    components.append({
                        'cells': cells,
                        'min_r': min_r,
                        'min_c': min_c
                    })
    return components
```
(This is helpful for high component extraction.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one shown) correctly preserves low components (1-4) and 0s unchanged across all grids, and properly identifies and recolors high components as a group.
 * Missed correct mapping for high components in train 1: a high component around rows 8-16 cols 9-12 is colored 1 in generated but expected 4 (e.g., row 8 cols 10-11: [1,1] vs [4,4]; row 9 cols 9-11: [1,1,1] vs [4,4,4]; row 12 cols 12-13: [1,1] vs [4,4]), suggesting wrong hole-to-color assignment, possibly due to sorting prioritizing a large 1-component over a smaller 4-component with matching holes.
 * Missed correct mapping in train 1 bottom area: high components around rows 27-30 cols 16-20 colored 1 in generated but expected 4 (e.g., row 27 cols 17-19: [1,1,1] vs [4,4,4]; row 28 cols 17-22: [1,1,1,1,1,1] vs [4,4,4,4,4,4]), again likely mapping error.
 * In train 2, missed large high component recoloring: areas like rows 2-7 cols 14-24 colored 1 in generated but expected 2 (e.g., row 2 cols 14-23: all 1s vs 2s; row 4 cols 13-24: 1s and 2s mixed incorrectly vs all 2s), indicating mapping chose 1 instead of 2, possibly from size/position sorting overriding the correct low 2-component.
 * In train 2, smaller mismatches like row 9 cols 10-12: [1,1,1] generated vs [2,2,2] expected, same mapping issue.
 * count_holes function is partially helpful but likely buggy: it correctly floods from borders to mark reachable 0s, but when counting interior holes, it increments hole_count once per connected 0-region (good), yet only checks grid[r][c] == 0 for starting points— this might miss non-0 interiors or overcount if barriers leak incorrectly; however, it's unclear why it leads to wrong hole counts for mapping (possibly unknown interaction with adjacent low components allowing leakage).
 * build_hole_to_color_mapping is helpful in concept but flawed in practice: sorting by (-size, min_r, min_c) works for prioritizing largest but causes wrong selection when multiple low components share hole counts (e.g., a huge 1-block with 0 holes overrides a smaller 4-block with 0 holes).
 * Overall, the program structure (copy grid, extract low/high, map via holes, apply to high) is a good skeleton and essential, but hole counting and mapping resolution are broken or insufficient for these cases.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but count_holes could be refined (e.g., verify if it counts total enclosed 0s instead of regions, though code shows regions).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it heavily favors coloring most high components as 1 (e.g., large left-side structures in rows 0-14 cols 9-12 and rows 18-20 cols 0-5 are all 1s, and scattered 1s elsewhere), while only a bottom-right high component (rows 18-29 cols 26-29) gets 4s—this pattern mirrors the train example mapping errors, suggesting the same issue of over-prioritizing a large low-1 component in the mapping, ignoring what should be a 4 or other color based on holes.
 * It preserves low areas correctly (e.g., row 18 cols 1-2: [1,1] unchanged), but the uniform 1-coloring for diverse high shapes implies incorrect hole counts or mapping (e.g., if multiple high components have different hole counts, they should map differently, but all left ones are 1, unlike expected variety in trains).
 * The test likely has varied high components (based on scattered >4 patterns in generated), but output doesn't differentiate them properly—e.g., the vertical 1s in col 24 across rows 0-29 suggest a single tall high component mis-mapped to 1, but if it encloses different holes than the bottom 4-area, it should differ; this doesn't make sense without input, but inconsistency with train expectations indicates it's wrong.
 * To handle test, mapping must resolve ties better (e.g., perhaps sort differently or use all matching colors somehow, or recount holes excluding other lows as barriers).
