=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 01:34:37] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    new_g = [[8] * w for _ in range(h)]
    c = -1
    for idx in range(h * w):
        r = idx // w
        s = idx % w
        if g[r][s] == 4:
            c = s
            break
    if c != -1:
        for r in range(h):
            new_g[r][c] = 2
    return new_g

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 01:51:18] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid containing markers like 4 (possibly indicating a starting point or key element) and transforming it into a new grid filled with 8s except for specific patterns of 2s that highlight or trace structures, paths, or shapes based on the positions and relationships of elements in the input grid. The current program oversimplifies this by only identifying the first 4 and filling its entire column with 2s, which works for simple vertical cases but fails to capture more complex, non-uniform patterns like diagonals, horizontals, or blob-like shapes seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid likely contains multiple 4s or other elements (e.g., implied by patterns in expects), and the output 2s form connected or symmetric shapes (e.g., lines, diamonds, or filled regions) rather than full columns or rows—e.g., in training 2, 2s appear in tapering diagonals and horizontal bands, not a single vertical line.
 * Subtlety: The position of the first 4 determines a starting column, but subsequent 2s propagate in multiple directions (horizontal, diagonal) or fill regions based on proximity or symmetry, as seen in training 3 and 4 where 2s form mirrored or expanding patterns around certain rows/columns.
 * Key consideration: Outputs preserve the grid dimensions and fill everything else with 8s, but 2s are not uniform—e.g., in training 2, upper rows have 2s only in positions 19-20, mid-rows expand to full horizontal bands of 2s from column 8, and lower rows taper back; this suggests rules involving distance from the 4, row-specific expansions, or object detection like "blobs" of connected cells.
 * Easy to miss: No full-column fills in complex cases; instead, 2s are sparse or patterned (e.g., training 3 has isolated pairs of 2s in columns 4-5 and 16-17, expanding to full rows in mid-sections); the program ignores row variations and multiple potential starting points.
 * Across attempts: Only vertical propagation is handled, missing horizontal/diagonal spreads; grid may have implicit "objects" (connected 4s or other values) that need extraction before patterning; ensure iteration stops at first 4 only if it's a unique trigger, but expects suggest processing all or contextual elements.
 * Considerations for test: Without input grid, assume similar to training 4 (vertical trigger in column 5); if input has a single 4 in column 5, full-column 2s might work, but patterns in other trainings imply it should expand horizontally or form shapes, not a uniform column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    new_g = [[8] * w for _ in range(h)]
    c = -1
    for idx in range(h * w):
        r = idx // w
        s = idx % w
        if g[r][s] == 4:
            c = s
            break
    if c != -1:
        for r in range(h):
            new_g[r][c] = 2
    return new_g
```
(This is the core function from the attempt; it's helpful for basic grid initialization and finding the first 4's column, but broken for non-vertical patterns—extend it with row-wise or diagonal filling logic.)

No other specialized functions (e.g., for object extraction) were provided; a potential future helper could be a function to find all 4 positions and compute distances or connections:
```python
def find_all_markers(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    markers = []
    for r in range(len(g)):
        for s in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[r][s] == 4:
                markers.append((r, s))
    return markers
```
(This would be helpful to detect multiple 4s if present, as single-4 assumption fails in complex expects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles training 1, likely a simple case where the single 4 triggers a full vertical column of 2s matching the expected output.
 * Failed training 2: Generated uniform column 10 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has varied patterns—e.g., rows 0-2 have 2s only at indices 19-20, row 3 at 9-10 and 19-20, rows 4-5 full horizontal 2s from index 8 to 21, then tapering; difference is lack of horizontal/diagonal expansion and row-specific widths (unknown why, possibly distance-based filling from 4).
 * Failed training 3: Generated full column 16 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected starts with all-8s rows 0-2, then pairs of 2s (e.g., row 2: indices 4-5 and 16-17), expands to full rows of 2s in mid-section (rows 4-5: indices 2-20), and tapers with isolated 2s; difference is over-filling the entire column instead of patterned, symmetric spreads around multiple points.
 * Failed training 4: Generated full column 5 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has all-8s in upper rows 0-2, then horizontal expansions (e.g., row 3: indices 4-5 as 2s, row 5: full row of 2s from 2-21, rows 6-7 same), tapering to single 2s in column 5 lower down; difference is ignoring horizontal fills and row variations, treating it as pure vertical.
 * The linear scan for first 4 works for simple cases but misses multi-4 or contextual rules; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed for "blobs" or connected components.
 * Function for grid init and column fill is partially helpful but not for the puzzle—extend to pattern generation; no unhelpful/broken functions beyond this oversimplification.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a uniform column 5 (index 5) of 2s across all 27 rows, with rest 8s, similar to training 4's generated but extended to a taller grid.
 * This does not look correct based on patterns in trainings 2-4, where even vertical triggers lead to non-uniform outputs (e.g., horizontal expansions in mid-rows, tapering at top/bottom); if the test input mirrors training 4 (4 in column 5), expect similar shaped patterns like full horizontals in central rows, not a full column—current output overfills vertically without variation, likely incorrect for the same reasons as training 4.

[2025-10-02 01:51:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 02:15:32] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving filling connected regions (likely representing solid objects like shapes or organic forms such as trees/mushrooms) based on partial outlines and structural elements, where numbers like 1 (interior points), 3 (boundaries/edges), 4 (stem starters), 2 (pre-filled or to-fill solid), and 8 (empty/background) guide the filling process to complete coherent blobs without overfilling isolated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Identify a "stem" column via a 4 marker and fill downward from the top (or the first non-8 block) with 2s, treating it as a vertical anchor that connects to overhead structures.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical): Between groups of non-8 cells separated by 8s, fill gaps with 2s only if an adjacent 3 (edge) borders the gap and the group contains at least one 1 (interior), ensuring fills bridge logical continuations without arbitrary extensions.
 * Flood fill: Propagate 2s into adjacent (4-directional) 1s and 3s that are unvisited, but only after initial placements; this connects interiors and boundaries but skips 8s and already-filled areas to avoid spilling into voids.
 * Edge extensions: For boundary groups (left/right for rows, top/bottom for columns), extend fills outward only if the edge cell is a 3, the group has a 1, and some part is already filled with 2—prevents over-extension into infinite empties but allows completing open-ended shapes.
 * Subtleties: 8s act as hard barriers, so groups are segmented by them; original 2s and 4s are preserved/treated as seeds; fills must respect object cohesion (e.g., no filling across unrelated 8-separated regions); potential for multiple blobs, but stem prioritizes vertical continuity; easy to miss that extensions require both a 3 at the edge AND a 1 inside, avoiding false positives on empty outlines.
 * Considerations: Order matters—stem first, then copy originals, gaps, flood, extensions—to build from structure outward; handles irregular shapes but may fail on diagonal connections (code uses only orthogonal); assumes single stem (returns -1 if none, but fills nothing extra); 1s confirm "fillable" interiors, 3s suggest permeable boundaries.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_column(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Locates the stem column by finding any 4; simple but essential for anchoring vertical fills.
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] == 4:

    return -1
```

def fill_stem(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]], c: int):
    # Identifies blocks of non-8 rows in the stem column and fills from the topmost block downward to the bottom.
    # Handles multiple disconnected non-8 segments by starting from the earliest one, ensuring full stem completion.

```

```python
def get_groups_row(row: List[int]) -> List[tuple]:
    # Extracts contiguous non-8 segments in a row as (start, end) tuples; skips 8s to define isolated groups.
    # Symmetric version exists for columns (get_col_groups); crucial for gap detection between segments.
    groups = []
    n = len(row)
    j = 0
    while j < n:

def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], out: List[List[int]]):
    # BFS from all initial 2s to fill adjacent 1s and 3s, marking visited to prevent revisits; uses deque for efficiency.
    # Key for connecting interiors/boundaries after seeding, but limited to orthogonal directions—may miss diagonal puzzles.
    height = len(g)
    width = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * width for _ in range(height)]
    q = deque()
    for i in range(height):

                visited[i][j] = True
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()
        for dx, dy in dirs:
            nx = x + dx
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] in (1, 3):
                out[nx][ny] = 2
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but the code builds a complete pipeline from stem detection to final extensions.
 * Successfully handled all 4 training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating strong grasp of core filling mechanics for standard cases like connected outlines with stems.
 * What worked: Stem filling anchors vertical structures correctly; gap filling bridges 8-separated groups conditionally; flood fill connects 1/3 regions orthogonally; extensions complete open edges without overreach.
 * What didn't work/missed: No explicit handling for multiple stems or non-stem objects (assumes single 4-column); potential oversight in diagonal connections (flood fill is orthogonal-only, which may fragment diagonal blobs); edge extensions check for filled parts but might not trigger if flood fill misses seeds; no validation for overfilling (e.g., if 3s form loops without 1s).
 * get_groups_row and get_col_groups are essential for segmenting inputs into fillable units.
 * fill_horizontal_gaps and fill_vertical_gaps correctly condition on 3+1 presence but could be unhelpful if gaps are diagonal (not addressed).
 * extend_edges is helpful for boundary completion but may be broken for cases where the "highest/lowest" group isn't the absolute edge due to leading 8s.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem relevant, though flood_fill's orthogonal limitation might need 8-directional dirs for some puzzles.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output depicts a 27x27 grid (rows listed as 1D arrays) with a prominent vertical "stem" of 2s in columns 16-17 from row 0 downward (full height, double-thick at top), suggesting correct stem filling from a 4 marker.
 * A large irregular blob of 2s on the left (rows 3-9, columns 2-8 and extending rightward variably) resembles foliage or a crown, connected via flood/gaps, with a smaller vertical extension in column 5 from row 4 to bottom (thin trunk-like).
 * Bottom half (rows 13+) shows only the main stem filled (single or double 2s in col 16-17), with isolated 2s in col 5, and all else 8s—no horizontal branching or fills, which makes sense if input has no 1/3 clues there.
 * Overall, the output looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., no fills in pure 8 areas, connections via 1/3 implied), forming a tree-like shape; it makes sense as correct if the test input has a stemmed object with left-side canopy and a separate thin vertical element, but without input grid, can't confirm if flood missed any 1/3 regions or if extensions over/under-filled boundaries—appears visually plausible and not obviously wrong (e.g., no stray 2s in voids).

[2025-10-02 02:15:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid containing markers like 4 (possibly indicating a starting point or key element) and transforming it into a new grid filled with 8s except for specific patterns of 2s that highlight or trace structures, paths, or shapes based on the positions and relationships of elements in the input grid. The current program oversimplifies this by only identifying the first 4 and filling its entire column with 2s, which works for simple vertical cases but fails to capture more complex, non-uniform patterns like diagonals, horizontals, or blob-like shapes seen in the expected outputs.

 * The input grid likely contains multiple 4s or other elements (e.g., implied by patterns in expects), and the output 2s form connected or symmetric shapes (e.g., lines, diamonds, or filled regions) rather than full columns or rows—e.g., in training 2, 2s appear in tapering diagonals and horizontal bands, not a single vertical line.
 * Subtlety: The position of the first 4 determines a starting column, but subsequent 2s propagate in multiple directions (horizontal, diagonal) or fill regions based on proximity or symmetry, as seen in training 3 and 4 where 2s form mirrored or expanding patterns around certain rows/columns.
 * Key consideration: Outputs preserve the grid dimensions and fill everything else with 8s, but 2s are not uniform—e.g., in training 2, upper rows have 2s only in positions 19-20, mid-rows expand to full horizontal bands of 2s from column 8, and lower rows taper back; this suggests rules involving distance from the 4, row-specific expansions, or object detection like "blobs" of connected cells.
 * Easy to miss: No full-column fills in complex cases; instead, 2s are sparse or patterned (e.g., training 3 has isolated pairs of 2s in columns 4-5 and 16-17, expanding to full rows in mid-sections); the program ignores row variations and multiple potential starting points.
 * Across attempts: Only vertical propagation is handled, missing horizontal/diagonal spreads; grid may have implicit "objects" (connected 4s or other values) that need extraction before patterning; ensure iteration stops at first 4 only if it's a unique trigger, but expects suggest processing all or contextual elements.
 * Considerations for test: Without input grid, assume similar to training 4 (vertical trigger in column 5); if input has a single 4 in column 5, full-column 2s might work, but patterns in other trainings imply it should expand horizontally or form shapes, not a uniform column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    new_g = [[8] * w for _ in range(h)]
    c = -1
    for idx in range(h * w):
        r = idx // w
        s = idx % w
        if g[r][s] == 4:
            c = s
            break
    if c != -1:
        for r in range(h):
            new_g[r][c] = 2
    return new_g
```
(This is the core function from the attempt; it's helpful for basic grid initialization and finding the first 4's column, but broken for non-vertical patterns—extend it with row-wise or diagonal filling logic.)

No other specialized functions (e.g., for object extraction) were provided; a potential future helper could be a function to find all 4 positions and compute distances or connections:
```python
def find_all_markers(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    markers = []
    for r in range(len(g)):
        for s in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[r][s] == 4:
                markers.append((r, s))
    return markers
```
(This would be helpful to detect multiple 4s if present, as single-4 assumption fails in complex expects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles training 1, likely a simple case where the single 4 triggers a full vertical column of 2s matching the expected output.
 * Failed training 2: Generated uniform column 10 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has varied patterns—e.g., rows 0-2 have 2s only at indices 19-20, row 3 at 9-10 and 19-20, rows 4-5 full horizontal 2s from index 8 to 21, then tapering; difference is lack of horizontal/diagonal expansion and row-specific widths (unknown why, possibly distance-based filling from 4).
 * Failed training 3: Generated full column 16 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected starts with all-8s rows 0-2, then pairs of 2s (e.g., row 2: indices 4-5 and 16-17), expands to full rows of 2s in mid-section (rows 4-5: indices 2-20), and tapers with isolated 2s; difference is over-filling the entire column instead of patterned, symmetric spreads around multiple points.
 * Failed training 4: Generated full column 5 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has all-8s in upper rows 0-2, then horizontal expansions (e.g., row 3: indices 4-5 as 2s, row 5: full row of 2s from 2-21, rows 6-7 same), tapering to single 2s in column 5 lower down; difference is ignoring horizontal fills and row variations, treating it as pure vertical.
 * The linear scan for first 4 works for simple cases but misses multi-4 or contextual rules; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed for "blobs" or connected components.
 * Function for grid init and column fill is partially helpful but not for the puzzle—extend to pattern generation; no unhelpful/broken functions beyond this oversimplification.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a uniform column 5 (index 5) of 2s across all 27 rows, with rest 8s, similar to training 4's generated but extended to a taller grid.
 * This does not look correct based on patterns in trainings 2-4, where even vertical triggers lead to non-uniform outputs (e.g., horizontal expansions in mid-rows, tapering at top/bottom); if the test input mirrors training 4 (4 in column 5), expect similar shaped patterns like full horizontals in central rows, not a full column—current output overfills vertically without variation, likely incorrect for the same reasons as training 4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving filling connected regions (likely representing solid objects like shapes or organic forms such as trees/mushrooms) based on partial outlines and structural elements, where numbers like 1 (interior points), 3 (boundaries/edges), 4 (stem starters), 2 (pre-filled or to-fill solid), and 8 (empty/background) guide the filling process to complete coherent blobs without overfilling isolated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Identify a "stem" column via a 4 marker and fill downward from the top (or the first non-8 block) with 2s, treating it as a vertical anchor that connects to overhead structures.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical): Between groups of non-8 cells separated by 8s, fill gaps with 2s only if an adjacent 3 (edge) borders the gap and the group contains at least one 1 (interior), ensuring fills bridge logical continuations without arbitrary extensions.
 * Flood fill: Propagate 2s into adjacent (4-directional) 1s and 3s that are unvisited, but only after initial placements; this connects interiors and boundaries but skips 8s and already-filled areas to avoid spilling into voids.
 * Edge extensions: For boundary groups (left/right for rows, top/bottom for columns), extend fills outward only if the edge cell is a 3, the group has a 1, and some part is already filled with 2—prevents over-extension into infinite empties but allows completing open-ended shapes.
 * Subtleties: 8s act as hard barriers, so groups are segmented by them; original 2s and 4s are preserved/treated as seeds; fills must respect object cohesion (e.g., no filling across unrelated 8-separated regions); potential for multiple blobs, but stem prioritizes vertical continuity; easy to miss that extensions require both a 3 at the edge AND a 1 inside, avoiding false positives on empty outlines.
 * Considerations: Order matters—stem first, then copy originals, gaps, flood, extensions—to build from structure outward; handles irregular shapes but may fail on diagonal connections (code uses only orthogonal); assumes single stem (returns -1 if none, but fills nothing extra); 1s confirm "fillable" interiors, 3s suggest permeable boundaries.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_column(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Locates the stem column by finding any 4; simple but essential for anchoring vertical fills.
    for i in range(len(g)):

    n = len(row)
    j = 0

            if 0 <= nx < height and 0 <= ny < width and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] in (1, 3):
                out[nx][ny] = 2
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but the code builds a complete pipeline from stem detection to final extensions.
 * Successfully handled all 4 training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating strong grasp of core filling mechanics for standard cases like connected outlines with stems.
 * What worked: Stem filling anchors vertical structures correctly; gap filling bridges 8-separated groups conditionally; flood fill connects 1/3 regions orthogonally; extensions complete open edges without overreach.
 * What didn't work/missed: No explicit handling for multiple stems or non-stem objects (assumes single 4-column); potential oversight in diagonal connections (flood fill is orthogonal-only, which may fragment diagonal blobs); edge extensions check for filled parts but might not trigger if flood fill misses seeds; no validation for overfilling (e.g., if 3s form loops without 1s).
 * get_groups_row and get_col_groups are essential for segmenting inputs into fillable units.
 * fill_horizontal_gaps and fill_vertical_gaps correctly condition on 3+1 presence but could be unhelpful if gaps are diagonal (not addressed).
 * extend_edges is helpful for boundary completion but may be broken for cases where the "highest/lowest" group isn't the absolute edge due to leading 8s.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem relevant, though flood_fill's orthogonal limitation might need 8-directional dirs for some puzzles.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output depicts a 27x27 grid (rows listed as 1D arrays) with a prominent vertical "stem" of 2s in columns 16-17 from row 0 downward (full height, double-thick at top), suggesting correct stem filling from a 4 marker.
 * A large irregular blob of 2s on the left (rows 3-9, columns 2-8 and extending rightward variably) resembles foliage or a crown, connected via flood/gaps, with a smaller vertical extension in column 5 from row 4 to bottom (thin trunk-like).
 * Bottom half (rows 13+) shows only the main stem filled (single or double 2s in col 16-17), with isolated 2s in col 5, and all else 8s—no horizontal branching or fills, which makes sense if input has no 1/3 clues there.
 * Overall, the output looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., no fills in pure 8 areas, connections via 1/3 implied), forming a tree-like shape; it makes sense as correct if the test input has a stemmed object with left-side canopy and a separate thin vertical element, but without input grid, can't confirm if flood missed any 1/3 regions or if extensions over/under-filled boundaries—appears visually plausible and not obviously wrong (e.g., no stray 2s in voids).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 02:29:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle (likely a variant of a connection or region-filling puzzle like a tree-drawing or path-completion challenge) where the input grid contains clues (numbers like 1 for interior points, 3 for edge/endpoint markers, 4 for a starting stem point, 2 for pre-filled paths, and 8 for barriers or empty space), and the goal is to output a new grid filling connected regions or paths with 2s based on rules for stems, gaps, flooding, and edge extensions, while leaving unfilled areas as 8s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes connectivity: filled areas (2s) must connect clues like 1s (which seem to require enclosure or path inclusion) and 3s (which act as borders or endpoints that trigger gap-filling or extensions), but only through non-8 cells; 8s act as hard barriers that split groups.
 * Stem filling starts from a unique column containing a 4 (likely a root or base clue) and fills downward or in a primary block from the top, but only in that column initially; subtle: if multiple non-8 blocks exist in the stem column, it prioritizes the topmost block's start row, which could miss multi-block stems if not handled.
 * Gap filling (horizontal or vertical) only occurs between adjacent groups of non-8 cells if both groups contain at least one 1, and at least one bordering cell (the end of the upper/left group or start of the lower/right group) is a 3; this bridges separated regions but skips if no 1s or no 3 border, preventing over-filling isolated clues.
 * Flood fill propagates from any initial 2s (including stems, pre-filled 2s/4s, and gaps) into adjacent (4-directional) cells that are 1 or 3, marking them as 2s; key subtlety: it does not fill into 8s, 2s (already filled), or other numbers, and uses BFS to ensure full connectivity without revisiting; this can expand regions but risks over-filling if initial seeds are wrong.
 * Edge extensions (horizontal or vertical) only apply to the first/last group in a row/column if it starts/ends with a 3, contains a 1, and has any 2s already; it then fills outward to the grid edge; subtle: this handles "open-ended" paths but requires prior filling (from flood or gaps) to trigger, and only for groups with 1s, avoiding extension of empty or clue-less edges.
 * Pre-filled handling: Any input 2 or 4 must be copied as 2s in output, serving as seeds; 1 and 3 are fillable but not initial seeds unless connected.
 * Overall process order matters: stem first, then copy seeds, then gaps (which may create new seeds), then flood (expands everything), then extensions (which rely on prior filling); running in wrong order could miss propagations.
 * Subtle elements easy to miss: Groups are defined by consecutive non-8 cells, ignoring isolated 8s; no filling into or across full 8 barriers; 4 is only for stem location, not general filling; potential for multiple iterations if gaps/extensions create new opportunities, but current code does single passes; handles empty grid edge case; assumes rectangular grid with uniform width.
 * Considerations across attempts: No diagonal connections (only 4 dirs); no looping or enclosure checks (pure connectivity); 1s seem mandatory to include (via flood/gaps), but 3s are optional unless bordering; potential for disconnected components if no connecting 3 or shared 1s.

(Note: Functions like fill_horizontal_gaps, fill_vertical_gaps, extend_horizontal_edges, and extend_vertical_edges are helpful extensions of the group-extraction logic above, applying conditional filling based on 1s and 3s; they are not broken but depend on get_groups_* working correctly. The main program orchestrates them in sequence, which is useful for the overall pipeline.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but the gap-filling functions (fill_horizontal_gaps/fill_vertical_gaps) could be unhelpful if they over-fill without checking for prior flood results, as they run before flood—might need iteration. No extraction functions for full "objects" (e.g., bounding boxes of connected 1/3 regions) were included, which could be added for better group analysis but isn't essential yet.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handled all 4 training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of stem filling, gap bridging with 1+3 conditions, flood propagation into 1/3, and edge extensions from 3s.
 * What worked: Stem correctly identifies and fills from 4's column (e.g., vertical line of 2s); gaps properly bridge only qualifying segments (with 1s and 3 borders); flood ensures connected 1/3 inclusion without crossing 8s; extensions handle open 3-ends post-filling; order of operations allows propagation (gaps seed flood, flood seeds extensions).
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the output fills a vertical stem in column 5 (indices 0-based, starting ~row 4 downward, matching a likely 4 position), copies presumed input 2/4 as 2s, creates horizontal "arms" (e.g., rows 3-4 cols 2-6, row 5 cols 1-8), a mid-blob (rows 5-7 cols 1-20ish with breaks), and vertical fills (e.g., col 16-17 partial), but leaves large areas (e.g., bottom rows 17-26 only stem 2s in col 5, no extensions) as 8s; this may miss deeper connections if input has isolated 1/3 groups not bridged by gaps or if extensions don't trigger due to no prior 2s in edge groups—unknown if input has such cases, but output seems under-filled compared to a full "tree" expectation (e.g., no full horizontal spans in lower rows despite potential 3 borders).
 * Subtleties missed potentially: Single-pass gaps/flood may not handle chained propagations (e.g., a gap creating a 2 that enables another gap); stem assumes top-block priority, which works for training but could fail if test stem is mid-grid without top connection; no validation that all 1s are filled (output has 8s near potential 1s? unknown without input grid).
 * Group extraction (get_groups_*) is essential for gaps/extensions and worked well in training; flood_fill is core and correctly limited to 1/3.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt shows partial understanding—training passed due to simple connected clues, but test may reveal gaps in handling sparse or multi-level connections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (27x27 grid) makes partial sense: It correctly forms a central vertical stem of 2s in column 5 (from ~row 4 to bottom), with horizontal extensions in upper-mid rows (e.g., row 3: cols 3-6; row 4: cols 2-7+16-17; row 5: cols 1-9+16-19), a filled blob in rows 5-7 cols 1-9 and partial in 16-19, and thinner verticals in cols 16-17 rows 0-10ish; this looks like a tree-like structure with branches, aligning with stem+gaps+flood rules if the input has a 4 in col 5, 1s in branch groups, and 3s at edges.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower rows (17-26) are only the stem 2 in col 5 with all else 8s, suggesting missed vertical gaps or extensions (e.g., if input has 1s+3s below, they should bridge/flood but didn't—possibly no connecting 3 borders or isolated groups); upper rows (0-2) have minimal 2s (only partial in cols 16-17), potentially under-filling if input has connectable 1/3 there; no full grid-spanning fills, and many 8-regions persist, which might leave 1s unfilled (unknown without input, but differs from expectation of comprehensive connectivity if puzzle requires all 1s included); overall, under-filled compared to training successes, likely missing iterative propagation or broader gap conditions.

[2025-10-02 02:29:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid containing markers like 4 (possibly indicating a starting point or key element) and transforming it into a new grid filled with 8s except for specific patterns of 2s that highlight or trace structures, paths, or shapes based on the positions and relationships of elements in the input grid. The current program oversimplifies this by only identifying the first 4 and filling its entire column with 2s, which works for simple vertical cases but fails to capture more complex, non-uniform patterns like diagonals, horizontals, or blob-like shapes seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid likely contains multiple 4s or other elements (e.g., implied by patterns in expects), and the output 2s form connected or symmetric shapes (e.g., lines, diamonds, or filled regions) rather than full columns or rows—e.g., in training 2, 2s appear in tapering diagonals and horizontal bands, not a single vertical line.
 * Subtlety: The position of the first 4 determines a starting column, but subsequent 2s propagate in multiple directions (horizontal, diagonal) or fill regions based on proximity or symmetry, as seen in training 3 and 4 where 2s form mirrored or expanding patterns around certain rows/columns.
 * Key consideration: Outputs preserve the grid dimensions and fill everything else with 8s, but 2s are not uniform—e.g., in training 2, upper rows have 2s only in positions 19-20, mid-rows expand to full horizontal bands of 2s from column 8, and lower rows taper back; this suggests rules involving distance from the 4, row-specific expansions, or object detection like "blobs" of connected cells.
 * Easy to miss: No full-column fills in complex cases; instead, 2s are sparse or patterned (e.g., training 3 has isolated pairs of 2s in columns 4-5 and 16-17, expanding to full rows in mid-sections); the program ignores row variations and multiple potential starting points.
 * Across attempts: Only vertical propagation is handled, missing horizontal/diagonal spreads; grid may have implicit "objects" (connected 4s or other values) that need extraction before patterning; ensure iteration stops at first 4 only if it's a unique trigger, but expects suggest processing all or contextual elements.
 * Considerations for test: Without input grid, assume similar to training 4 (vertical trigger in column 5); if input has a single 4 in column 5, full-column 2s might work, but patterns in other trainings imply it should expand horizontally or form shapes, not a uniform column.

    new_g = [[8] * w for _ in range(h)]
    c = -1
    for idx in range(h * w):
        r = idx // w
        s = idx % w
        if g[r][s] == 4:
            c = s
            break
    if c != -1:
        for r in range(h):
            new_g[r][c] = 2
    return new_g
```
(This is the core function from the attempt; it's helpful for basic grid initialization and finding the first 4's column, but broken for non-vertical patterns—extend it with row-wise or diagonal filling logic.)

No other specialized functions (e.g., for object extraction) were provided; a potential future helper could be a function to find all 4 positions and compute distances or connections:
```python
def find_all_markers(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    markers = []
    for r in range(len(g)):
        for s in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[r][s] == 4:
                markers.append((r, s))
    return markers
```
(This would be helpful to detect multiple 4s if present, as single-4 assumption fails in complex expects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles training 1, likely a simple case where the single 4 triggers a full vertical column of 2s matching the expected output.
 * Failed training 2: Generated uniform column 10 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has varied patterns—e.g., rows 0-2 have 2s only at indices 19-20, row 3 at 9-10 and 19-20, rows 4-5 full horizontal 2s from index 8 to 21, then tapering; difference is lack of horizontal/diagonal expansion and row-specific widths (unknown why, possibly distance-based filling from 4).
 * Failed training 3: Generated full column 16 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected starts with all-8s rows 0-2, then pairs of 2s (e.g., row 2: indices 4-5 and 16-17), expands to full rows of 2s in mid-section (rows 4-5: indices 2-20), and tapers with isolated 2s; difference is over-filling the entire column instead of patterned, symmetric spreads around multiple points.
 * Failed training 4: Generated full column 5 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has all-8s in upper rows 0-2, then horizontal expansions (e.g., row 3: indices 4-5 as 2s, row 5: full row of 2s from 2-21, rows 6-7 same), tapering to single 2s in column 5 lower down; difference is ignoring horizontal fills and row variations, treating it as pure vertical.
 * The linear scan for first 4 works for simple cases but misses multi-4 or contextual rules; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed for "blobs" or connected components.
 * Function for grid init and column fill is partially helpful but not for the puzzle—extend to pattern generation; no unhelpful/broken functions beyond this oversimplification.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a uniform column 5 (index 5) of 2s across all 27 rows, with rest 8s, similar to training 4's generated but extended to a taller grid.
 * This does not look correct based on patterns in trainings 2-4, where even vertical triggers lead to non-uniform outputs (e.g., horizontal expansions in mid-rows, tapering at top/bottom); if the test input mirrors training 4 (4 in column 5), expect similar shaped patterns like full horizontals in central rows, not a full column—current output overfills vertically without variation, likely incorrect for the same reasons as training 4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle (likely a variant of a connection or region-filling puzzle like a tree-drawing or path-completion challenge) where the input grid contains clues (numbers like 1 for interior points, 3 for edge/endpoint markers, 4 for a starting stem point, 2 for pre-filled paths, and 8 for barriers or empty space), and the goal is to output a new grid filling connected regions or paths with 2s based on rules for stems, gaps, flooding, and edge extensions, while leaving unfilled areas as 8s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes connectivity: filled areas (2s) must connect clues like 1s (which seem to require enclosure or path inclusion) and 3s (which act as borders or endpoints that trigger gap-filling or extensions), but only through non-8 cells; 8s act as hard barriers that split groups.
 * Stem filling starts from a unique column containing a 4 (likely a root or base clue) and fills downward or in a primary block from the top, but only in that column initially; subtle: if multiple non-8 blocks exist in the stem column, it prioritizes the topmost block's start row, which could miss multi-block stems if not handled.
 * Gap filling (horizontal or vertical) only occurs between adjacent groups of non-8 cells if both groups contain at least one 1, and at least one bordering cell (the end of the upper/left group or start of the lower/right group) is a 3; this bridges separated regions but skips if no 1s or no 3 border, preventing over-filling isolated clues.
 * Flood fill propagates from any initial 2s (including stems, pre-filled 2s/4s, and gaps) into adjacent (4-directional) cells that are 1 or 3, marking them as 2s; key subtlety: it does not fill into 8s, 2s (already filled), or other numbers, and uses BFS to ensure full connectivity without revisiting; this can expand regions but risks over-filling if initial seeds are wrong.
 * Edge extensions (horizontal or vertical) only apply to the first/last group in a row/column if it starts/ends with a 3, contains a 1, and has any 2s already; it then fills outward to the grid edge; subtle: this handles "open-ended" paths but requires prior filling (from flood or gaps) to trigger, and only for groups with 1s, avoiding extension of empty or clue-less edges.
 * Pre-filled handling: Any input 2 or 4 must be copied as 2s in output, serving as seeds; 1 and 3 are fillable but not initial seeds unless connected.
 * Overall process order matters: stem first, then copy seeds, then gaps (which may create new seeds), then flood (expands everything), then extensions (which rely on prior filling); running in wrong order could miss propagations.
 * Subtle elements easy to miss: Groups are defined by consecutive non-8 cells, ignoring isolated 8s; no filling into or across full 8 barriers; 4 is only for stem location, not general filling; potential for multiple iterations if gaps/extensions create new opportunities, but current code does single passes; handles empty grid edge case; assumes rectangular grid with uniform width.
 * Considerations across attempts: No diagonal connections (only 4 dirs); no looping or enclosure checks (pure connectivity); 1s seem mandatory to include (via flood/gaps), but 3s are optional unless bordering; potential for disconnected components if no connecting 3 or shared 1s.

(Note: Functions like fill_horizontal_gaps, fill_vertical_gaps, extend_horizontal_edges, and extend_vertical_edges are helpful extensions of the group-extraction logic above, applying conditional filling based on 1s and 3s; they are not broken but depend on get_groups_* working correctly. The main program orchestrates them in sequence, which is useful for the overall pipeline.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but the gap-filling functions (fill_horizontal_gaps/fill_vertical_gaps) could be unhelpful if they over-fill without checking for prior flood results, as they run before flood—might need iteration. No extraction functions for full "objects" (e.g., bounding boxes of connected 1/3 regions) were included, which could be added for better group analysis but isn't essential yet.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handled all 4 training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of stem filling, gap bridging with 1+3 conditions, flood propagation into 1/3, and edge extensions from 3s.
 * What worked: Stem correctly identifies and fills from 4's column (e.g., vertical line of 2s); gaps properly bridge only qualifying segments (with 1s and 3 borders); flood ensures connected 1/3 inclusion without crossing 8s; extensions handle open 3-ends post-filling; order of operations allows propagation (gaps seed flood, flood seeds extensions).
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the output fills a vertical stem in column 5 (indices 0-based, starting ~row 4 downward, matching a likely 4 position), copies presumed input 2/4 as 2s, creates horizontal "arms" (e.g., rows 3-4 cols 2-6, row 5 cols 1-8), a mid-blob (rows 5-7 cols 1-20ish with breaks), and vertical fills (e.g., col 16-17 partial), but leaves large areas (e.g., bottom rows 17-26 only stem 2s in col 5, no extensions) as 8s; this may miss deeper connections if input has isolated 1/3 groups not bridged by gaps or if extensions don't trigger due to no prior 2s in edge groups—unknown if input has such cases, but output seems under-filled compared to a full "tree" expectation (e.g., no full horizontal spans in lower rows despite potential 3 borders).
 * Subtleties missed potentially: Single-pass gaps/flood may not handle chained propagations (e.g., a gap creating a 2 that enables another gap); stem assumes top-block priority, which works for training but could fail if test stem is mid-grid without top connection; no validation that all 1s are filled (output has 8s near potential 1s? unknown without input grid).
 * Group extraction (get_groups_*) is essential for gaps/extensions and worked well in training; flood_fill is core and correctly limited to 1/3.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt shows partial understanding—training passed due to simple connected clues, but test may reveal gaps in handling sparse or multi-level connections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (27x27 grid) makes partial sense: It correctly forms a central vertical stem of 2s in column 5 (from ~row 4 to bottom), with horizontal extensions in upper-mid rows (e.g., row 3: cols 3-6; row 4: cols 2-7+16-17; row 5: cols 1-9+16-19), a filled blob in rows 5-7 cols 1-9 and partial in 16-19, and thinner verticals in cols 16-17 rows 0-10ish; this looks like a tree-like structure with branches, aligning with stem+gaps+flood rules if the input has a 4 in col 5, 1s in branch groups, and 3s at edges.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower rows (17-26) are only the stem 2 in col 5 with all else 8s, suggesting missed vertical gaps or extensions (e.g., if input has 1s+3s below, they should bridge/flood but didn't—possibly no connecting 3 borders or isolated groups); upper rows (0-2) have minimal 2s (only partial in cols 16-17), potentially under-filling if input has connectable 1/3 there; no full grid-spanning fills, and many 8-regions persist, which might leave 1s unfilled (unknown without input, but differs from expectation of comprehensive connectivity if puzzle requires all 1s included); overall, under-filled compared to training successes, likely missing iterative propagation or broader gap conditions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving filling connected regions (likely representing solid objects like shapes or organic forms such as trees/mushrooms) based on partial outlines and structural elements, where numbers like 1 (interior points), 3 (boundaries/edges), 4 (stem starters), 2 (pre-filled or to-fill solid), and 8 (empty/background) guide the filling process to complete coherent blobs without overfilling isolated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Identify a "stem" column via a 4 marker and fill downward from the top (or the first non-8 block) with 2s, treating it as a vertical anchor that connects to overhead structures.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical): Between groups of non-8 cells separated by 8s, fill gaps with 2s only if an adjacent 3 (edge) borders the gap and the group contains at least one 1 (interior), ensuring fills bridge logical continuations without arbitrary extensions.
 * Flood fill: Propagate 2s into adjacent (4-directional) 1s and 3s that are unvisited, but only after initial placements; this connects interiors and boundaries but skips 8s and already-filled areas to avoid spilling into voids.
 * Edge extensions: For boundary groups (left/right for rows, top/bottom for columns), extend fills outward only if the edge cell is a 3, the group has a 1, and some part is already filled with 2—prevents over-extension into infinite empties but allows completing open-ended shapes.
 * Subtleties: 8s act as hard barriers, so groups are segmented by them; original 2s and 4s are preserved/treated as seeds; fills must respect object cohesion (e.g., no filling across unrelated 8-separated regions); potential for multiple blobs, but stem prioritizes vertical continuity; easy to miss that extensions require both a 3 at the edge AND a 1 inside, avoiding false positives on empty outlines.
 * Considerations: Order matters—stem first, then copy originals, gaps, flood, extensions—to build from structure outward; handles irregular shapes but may fail on diagonal connections (code uses only orthogonal); assumes single stem (returns -1 if none, but fills nothing extra); 1s confirm "fillable" interiors, 3s suggest permeable boundaries.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but the code builds a complete pipeline from stem detection to final extensions.
 * Successfully handled all 4 training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating strong grasp of core filling mechanics for standard cases like connected outlines with stems.
 * What worked: Stem filling anchors vertical structures correctly; gap filling bridges 8-separated groups conditionally; flood fill connects 1/3 regions orthogonally; extensions complete open edges without overreach.
 * What didn't work/missed: No explicit handling for multiple stems or non-stem objects (assumes single 4-column); potential oversight in diagonal connections (flood fill is orthogonal-only, which may fragment diagonal blobs); edge extensions check for filled parts but might not trigger if flood fill misses seeds; no validation for overfilling (e.g., if 3s form loops without 1s).
 * get_groups_row and get_col_groups are essential for segmenting inputs into fillable units.
 * fill_horizontal_gaps and fill_vertical_gaps correctly condition on 3+1 presence but could be unhelpful if gaps are diagonal (not addressed).
 * extend_edges is helpful for boundary completion but may be broken for cases where the "highest/lowest" group isn't the absolute edge due to leading 8s.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem relevant, though flood_fill's orthogonal limitation might need 8-directional dirs for some puzzles.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output depicts a 27x27 grid (rows listed as 1D arrays) with a prominent vertical "stem" of 2s in columns 16-17 from row 0 downward (full height, double-thick at top), suggesting correct stem filling from a 4 marker.
 * A large irregular blob of 2s on the left (rows 3-9, columns 2-8 and extending rightward variably) resembles foliage or a crown, connected via flood/gaps, with a smaller vertical extension in column 5 from row 4 to bottom (thin trunk-like).
 * Bottom half (rows 13+) shows only the main stem filled (single or double 2s in col 16-17), with isolated 2s in col 5, and all else 8s—no horizontal branching or fills, which makes sense if input has no 1/3 clues there.
 * Overall, the output looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., no fills in pure 8 areas, connections via 1/3 implied), forming a tree-like shape; it makes sense as correct if the test input has a stemmed object with left-side canopy and a separate thin vertical element, but without input grid, can't confirm if flood missed any 1/3 regions or if extensions over/under-filled boundaries—appears visually plausible and not obviously wrong (e.g., no stray 2s in voids).

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 02:37:31] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle solver where the goal is to fill in a output grid (using 2 for filled cells) based on input clues: 1 (likely internal elements like dots or leaves), 2 (pre-filled), 3 (borders or edges), 4 (stem starters), and 8 (empty/unknown). The solver connects and extends these into coherent shapes, such as stems, branches, or objects, by filling gaps, flooding adjacent areas, and extending from borders, likely representing organic structures like plants or trees in a logic puzzle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify and fully fill vertical "stem" columns starting from any 4 clue, extending downward (or fully if isolated), but only in non-8 areas of the input—subtlety: stems may not span the entire height if blocked by 8's, and blocks of non-8 rows need grouping to determine fill range.
 * Horizontal and vertical gap filling between groups of non-8 cells only if both sides contain at least one 1 (indicating content) and at least one side has a 3 border—easy to miss: gaps must be strictly separated (no overlap), and filling only occurs in 8's without overwriting existing non-8's.
 * Flood fill from any 2 into orthogonally adjacent 1 or 3 cells that are still 8, but not into 8-only areas or other numbers—subtlety: this is iterative and can propagate changes, but must respect input boundaries (no filling pure 8 regions).
 * Edge extension from 3 borders outward (up/down for vertical, left/right for horizontal) only if the group has both 1 (content) and 2 (already filled)—key miss: extensions stop at grid edges or existing non-8's, and only apply to the outermost groups per row/column.
 * Iteration is crucial: all filling steps (gaps, flood, extensions) run in a loop until no changes, as each can enable the next (e.g., gap fill enables flood).
 * Input groups (rows/columns) ignore 8's as separators, treating consecutive non-8's as blocks—subtlety: empty rows/columns (all 8's) skip processing.
 * No overwriting of input non-8 cells; output starts as copy of 2/4 to 2, rest 8.
 * Potential for multiple components: solver handles per-row/column independently but flood connects across.
 * Subtle edge case: if no stem (no 4), no special stem fill, but other rules still apply.
 * Over-extension risk: extensions only if both 1 and 2 present, preventing filling empty bordered areas.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; no prior iterations to compare directly.
 * Stem filling works well: correctly identifies and fills vertical columns from 4, grouping non-8 blocks appropriately.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical) succeeds in training examples by bridging separated groups with 1's and 3's, but may underfill if iterations don't propagate fully (e.g., new 2's from one step enabling later gaps).
 * Flood fill is effective for connecting adjacent 1/3 areas but only after initial fills; subtlety missed in isolation: it doesn't fill pure 8 gaps without a 1/3 anchor.
 * Edge extensions handle outward growth from 3's correctly in training, but could overextend if 1/2 checks are too loose (though not observed here).
 * Overall loop iterates all steps until stable, which is key and worked for all training examples (all CORRECT).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_stem, fill_stem, get_groups, fill_gaps, flood_fill, extend_edges) are relevant and build toward shape completion.
 * extract_objects not present or needed; no object extraction attempted, as puzzle seems rule-based filling rather than high-level parsing.

**Test output:**
 * The test output forms a coherent vertical stem in column 5 (0-indexed) with 2's from roughly row 4 to row 25, plus horizontal branches (e.g., row 4: 2's cols 1-7; row 5: 2's cols 1-9 and 15-19; similar patterns upward to row 2), tapering off at the bottom with isolated 2's in rows 17-25 col 5 only—looks like a tree trunk with upper branches, leaving lower grid as 8's.
 * This makes sense for a puzzle with a central stem (likely a 4 in input col 5) and horizontal clues (1's and 3's) in upper rows forming branches; flood and gap fills connected them without overfilling the bottom (possibly no 1/3 clues there).
 * No obvious errors: no stray 2's in empty areas, extensions seem bounded, and structure matches organic puzzle expectations (e.g., no full-grid fill).
 * Minor concern: rows 0-1 have partial 2's only in cols 16-17 (possibly a small branch or stem extension), which might be correct if input has isolated 1/3 there, but could indicate underfilling if a larger connection was expected—unknown without input grid, but consistent with rules.
 * Overall, test output looks correct and demonstrates understanding, as it avoids common pitfalls like filling all 8's or ignoring stems.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 02:37:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid containing markers like 4 (possibly indicating a starting point or key element) and transforming it into a new grid filled with 8s except for specific patterns of 2s that highlight or trace structures, paths, or shapes based on the positions and relationships of elements in the input grid. The current program oversimplifies this by only identifying the first 4 and filling its entire column with 2s, which works for simple vertical cases but fails to capture more complex, non-uniform patterns like diagonals, horizontals, or blob-like shapes seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid likely contains multiple 4s or other elements (e.g., implied by patterns in expects), and the output 2s form connected or symmetric shapes (e.g., lines, diamonds, or filled regions) rather than full columns or rows—e.g., in training 2, 2s appear in tapering diagonals and horizontal bands, not a single vertical line.
 * Subtlety: The position of the first 4 determines a starting column, but subsequent 2s propagate in multiple directions (horizontal, diagonal) or fill regions based on proximity or symmetry, as seen in training 3 and 4 where 2s form mirrored or expanding patterns around certain rows/columns.
 * Key consideration: Outputs preserve the grid dimensions and fill everything else with 8s, but 2s are not uniform—e.g., in training 2, upper rows have 2s only in positions 19-20, mid-rows expand to full horizontal bands of 2s from column 8, and lower rows taper back; this suggests rules involving distance from the 4, row-specific expansions, or object detection like "blobs" of connected cells.
 * Easy to miss: No full-column fills in complex cases; instead, 2s are sparse or patterned (e.g., training 3 has isolated pairs of 2s in columns 4-5 and 16-17, expanding to full rows in mid-sections); the program ignores row variations and multiple potential starting points.
 * Across attempts: Only vertical propagation is handled, missing horizontal/diagonal spreads; grid may have implicit "objects" (connected 4s or other values) that need extraction before patterning; ensure iteration stops at first 4 only if it's a unique trigger, but expects suggest processing all or contextual elements.
 * Considerations for test: Without input grid, assume similar to training 4 (vertical trigger in column 5); if input has a single 4 in column 5, full-column 2s might work, but patterns in other trainings imply it should expand horizontally or form shapes, not a uniform column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    new_g = [[8] * w for _ in range(h)]
    c = -1
    for idx in range(h * w):
        r = idx // w
        s = idx % w
        if g[r][s] == 4:
            c = s
            break
    if c != -1:
        for r in range(h):
            new_g[r][c] = 2
    return new_g
```
(This is the core function from the attempt; it's helpful for basic grid initialization and finding the first 4's column, but broken for non-vertical patterns—extend it with row-wise or diagonal filling logic.)

No other specialized functions (e.g., for object extraction) were provided; a potential future helper could be a function to find all 4 positions and compute distances or connections:
```python
def find_all_markers(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    markers = []
    for r in range(len(g)):
        for s in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[r][s] == 4:
                markers.append((r, s))
    return markers
```
(This would be helpful to detect multiple 4s if present, as single-4 assumption fails in complex expects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles training 1, likely a simple case where the single 4 triggers a full vertical column of 2s matching the expected output.
 * Failed training 2: Generated uniform column 10 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has varied patterns—e.g., rows 0-2 have 2s only at indices 19-20, row 3 at 9-10 and 19-20, rows 4-5 full horizontal 2s from index 8 to 21, then tapering; difference is lack of horizontal/diagonal expansion and row-specific widths (unknown why, possibly distance-based filling from 4).
 * Failed training 3: Generated full column 16 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected starts with all-8s rows 0-2, then pairs of 2s (e.g., row 2: indices 4-5 and 16-17), expands to full rows of 2s in mid-section (rows 4-5: indices 2-20), and tapers with isolated 2s; difference is over-filling the entire column instead of patterned, symmetric spreads around multiple points.
 * Failed training 4: Generated full column 5 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has all-8s in upper rows 0-2, then horizontal expansions (e.g., row 3: indices 4-5 as 2s, row 5: full row of 2s from 2-21, rows 6-7 same), tapering to single 2s in column 5 lower down; difference is ignoring horizontal fills and row variations, treating it as pure vertical.
 * The linear scan for first 4 works for simple cases but misses multi-4 or contextual rules; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed for "blobs" or connected components.
 * Function for grid init and column fill is partially helpful but not for the puzzle—extend to pattern generation; no unhelpful/broken functions beyond this oversimplification.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a uniform column 5 (index 5) of 2s across all 27 rows, with rest 8s, similar to training 4's generated but extended to a taller grid.
 * This does not look correct based on patterns in trainings 2-4, where even vertical triggers lead to non-uniform outputs (e.g., horizontal expansions in mid-rows, tapering at top/bottom); if the test input mirrors training 4 (4 in column 5), expect similar shaped patterns like full horizontals in central rows, not a full column—current output overfills vertically without variation, likely incorrect for the same reasons as training 4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle (likely a variant of a connection or region-filling puzzle like a tree-drawing or path-completion challenge) where the input grid contains clues (numbers like 1 for interior points, 3 for edge/endpoint markers, 4 for a starting stem point, 2 for pre-filled paths, and 8 for barriers or empty space), and the goal is to output a new grid filling connected regions or paths with 2s based on rules for stems, gaps, flooding, and edge extensions, while leaving unfilled areas as 8s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes connectivity: filled areas (2s) must connect clues like 1s (which seem to require enclosure or path inclusion) and 3s (which act as borders or endpoints that trigger gap-filling or extensions), but only through non-8 cells; 8s act as hard barriers that split groups.
 * Stem filling starts from a unique column containing a 4 (likely a root or base clue) and fills downward or in a primary block from the top, but only in that column initially; subtle: if multiple non-8 blocks exist in the stem column, it prioritizes the topmost block's start row, which could miss multi-block stems if not handled.
 * Gap filling (horizontal or vertical) only occurs between adjacent groups of non-8 cells if both groups contain at least one 1, and at least one bordering cell (the end of the upper/left group or start of the lower/right group) is a 3; this bridges separated regions but skips if no 1s or no 3 border, preventing over-filling isolated clues.
 * Flood fill propagates from any initial 2s (including stems, pre-filled 2s/4s, and gaps) into adjacent (4-directional) cells that are 1 or 3, marking them as 2s; key subtlety: it does not fill into 8s, 2s (already filled), or other numbers, and uses BFS to ensure full connectivity without revisiting; this can expand regions but risks over-filling if initial seeds are wrong.
 * Edge extensions (horizontal or vertical) only apply to the first/last group in a row/column if it starts/ends with a 3, contains a 1, and has any 2s already; it then fills outward to the grid edge; subtle: this handles "open-ended" paths but requires prior filling (from flood or gaps) to trigger, and only for groups with 1s, avoiding extension of empty or clue-less edges.
 * Pre-filled handling: Any input 2 or 4 must be copied as 2s in output, serving as seeds; 1 and 3 are fillable but not initial seeds unless connected.
 * Overall process order matters: stem first, then copy seeds, then gaps (which may create new seeds), then flood (expands everything), then extensions (which rely on prior filling); running in wrong order could miss propagations.
 * Subtle elements easy to miss: Groups are defined by consecutive non-8 cells, ignoring isolated 8s; no filling into or across full 8 barriers; 4 is only for stem location, not general filling; potential for multiple iterations if gaps/extensions create new opportunities, but current code does single passes; handles empty grid edge case; assumes rectangular grid with uniform width.
 * Considerations across attempts: No diagonal connections (only 4 dirs); no looping or enclosure checks (pure connectivity); 1s seem mandatory to include (via flood/gaps), but 3s are optional unless bordering; potential for disconnected components if no connecting 3 or shared 1s.

(Note: Functions like fill_horizontal_gaps, fill_vertical_gaps, extend_horizontal_edges, and extend_vertical_edges are helpful extensions of the group-extraction logic above, applying conditional filling based on 1s and 3s; they are not broken but depend on get_groups_* working correctly. The main program orchestrates them in sequence, which is useful for the overall pipeline.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but the gap-filling functions (fill_horizontal_gaps/fill_vertical_gaps) could be unhelpful if they over-fill without checking for prior flood results, as they run before flood—might need iteration. No extraction functions for full "objects" (e.g., bounding boxes of connected 1/3 regions) were included, which could be added for better group analysis but isn't essential yet.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handled all 4 training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of stem filling, gap bridging with 1+3 conditions, flood propagation into 1/3, and edge extensions from 3s.
 * What worked: Stem correctly identifies and fills from 4's column (e.g., vertical line of 2s); gaps properly bridge only qualifying segments (with 1s and 3 borders); flood ensures connected 1/3 inclusion without crossing 8s; extensions handle open 3-ends post-filling; order of operations allows propagation (gaps seed flood, flood seeds extensions).
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the output fills a vertical stem in column 5 (indices 0-based, starting ~row 4 downward, matching a likely 4 position), copies presumed input 2/4 as 2s, creates horizontal "arms" (e.g., rows 3-4 cols 2-6, row 5 cols 1-8), a mid-blob (rows 5-7 cols 1-20ish with breaks), and vertical fills (e.g., col 16-17 partial), but leaves large areas (e.g., bottom rows 17-26 only stem 2s in col 5, no extensions) as 8s; this may miss deeper connections if input has isolated 1/3 groups not bridged by gaps or if extensions don't trigger due to no prior 2s in edge groups—unknown if input has such cases, but output seems under-filled compared to a full "tree" expectation (e.g., no full horizontal spans in lower rows despite potential 3 borders).
 * Subtleties missed potentially: Single-pass gaps/flood may not handle chained propagations (e.g., a gap creating a 2 that enables another gap); stem assumes top-block priority, which works for training but could fail if test stem is mid-grid without top connection; no validation that all 1s are filled (output has 8s near potential 1s? unknown without input grid).
 * Group extraction (get_groups_*) is essential for gaps/extensions and worked well in training; flood_fill is core and correctly limited to 1/3.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt shows partial understanding—training passed due to simple connected clues, but test may reveal gaps in handling sparse or multi-level connections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (27x27 grid) makes partial sense: It correctly forms a central vertical stem of 2s in column 5 (from ~row 4 to bottom), with horizontal extensions in upper-mid rows (e.g., row 3: cols 3-6; row 4: cols 2-7+16-17; row 5: cols 1-9+16-19), a filled blob in rows 5-7 cols 1-9 and partial in 16-19, and thinner verticals in cols 16-17 rows 0-10ish; this looks like a tree-like structure with branches, aligning with stem+gaps+flood rules if the input has a 4 in col 5, 1s in branch groups, and 3s at edges.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower rows (17-26) are only the stem 2 in col 5 with all else 8s, suggesting missed vertical gaps or extensions (e.g., if input has 1s+3s below, they should bridge/flood but didn't—possibly no connecting 3 borders or isolated groups); upper rows (0-2) have minimal 2s (only partial in cols 16-17), potentially under-filling if input has connectable 1/3 there; no full grid-spanning fills, and many 8-regions persist, which might leave 1s unfilled (unknown without input, but differs from expectation of comprehensive connectivity if puzzle requires all 1s included); overall, under-filled compared to training successes, likely missing iterative propagation or broader gap conditions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving filling connected regions (likely representing solid objects like shapes or organic forms such as trees/mushrooms) based on partial outlines and structural elements, where numbers like 1 (interior points), 3 (boundaries/edges), 4 (stem starters), 2 (pre-filled or to-fill solid), and 8 (empty/background) guide the filling process to complete coherent blobs without overfilling isolated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Identify a "stem" column via a 4 marker and fill downward from the top (or the first non-8 block) with 2s, treating it as a vertical anchor that connects to overhead structures.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical): Between groups of non-8 cells separated by 8s, fill gaps with 2s only if an adjacent 3 (edge) borders the gap and the group contains at least one 1 (interior), ensuring fills bridge logical continuations without arbitrary extensions.
 * Flood fill: Propagate 2s into adjacent (4-directional) 1s and 3s that are unvisited, but only after initial placements; this connects interiors and boundaries but skips 8s and already-filled areas to avoid spilling into voids.
 * Edge extensions: For boundary groups (left/right for rows, top/bottom for columns), extend fills outward only if the edge cell is a 3, the group has a 1, and some part is already filled with 2—prevents over-extension into infinite empties but allows completing open-ended shapes.
 * Subtleties: 8s act as hard barriers, so groups are segmented by them; original 2s and 4s are preserved/treated as seeds; fills must respect object cohesion (e.g., no filling across unrelated 8-separated regions); potential for multiple blobs, but stem prioritizes vertical continuity; easy to miss that extensions require both a 3 at the edge AND a 1 inside, avoiding false positives on empty outlines.
 * Considerations: Order matters—stem first, then copy originals, gaps, flood, extensions—to build from structure outward; handles irregular shapes but may fail on diagonal connections (code uses only orthogonal); assumes single stem (returns -1 if none, but fills nothing extra); 1s confirm "fillable" interiors, 3s suggest permeable boundaries.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but the code builds a complete pipeline from stem detection to final extensions.
 * Successfully handled all 4 training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating strong grasp of core filling mechanics for standard cases like connected outlines with stems.
 * What worked: Stem filling anchors vertical structures correctly; gap filling bridges 8-separated groups conditionally; flood fill connects 1/3 regions orthogonally; extensions complete open edges without overreach.
 * What didn't work/missed: No explicit handling for multiple stems or non-stem objects (assumes single 4-column); potential oversight in diagonal connections (flood fill is orthogonal-only, which may fragment diagonal blobs); edge extensions check for filled parts but might not trigger if flood fill misses seeds; no validation for overfilling (e.g., if 3s form loops without 1s).
 * get_groups_row and get_col_groups are essential for segmenting inputs into fillable units.
 * fill_horizontal_gaps and fill_vertical_gaps correctly condition on 3+1 presence but could be unhelpful if gaps are diagonal (not addressed).
 * extend_edges is helpful for boundary completion but may be broken for cases where the "highest/lowest" group isn't the absolute edge due to leading 8s.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem relevant, though flood_fill's orthogonal limitation might need 8-directional dirs for some puzzles.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output depicts a 27x27 grid (rows listed as 1D arrays) with a prominent vertical "stem" of 2s in columns 16-17 from row 0 downward (full height, double-thick at top), suggesting correct stem filling from a 4 marker.
 * A large irregular blob of 2s on the left (rows 3-9, columns 2-8 and extending rightward variably) resembles foliage or a crown, connected via flood/gaps, with a smaller vertical extension in column 5 from row 4 to bottom (thin trunk-like).
 * Bottom half (rows 13+) shows only the main stem filled (single or double 2s in col 16-17), with isolated 2s in col 5, and all else 8s—no horizontal branching or fills, which makes sense if input has no 1/3 clues there.
 * Overall, the output looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., no fills in pure 8 areas, connections via 1/3 implied), forming a tree-like shape; it makes sense as correct if the test input has a stemmed object with left-side canopy and a separate thin vertical element, but without input grid, can't confirm if flood missed any 1/3 regions or if extensions over/under-filled boundaries—appears visually plausible and not obviously wrong (e.g., no stray 2s in voids).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle solver where the goal is to fill in a output grid (using 2 for filled cells) based on input clues: 1 (likely internal elements like dots or leaves), 2 (pre-filled), 3 (borders or edges), 4 (stem starters), and 8 (empty/unknown). The solver connects and extends these into coherent shapes, such as stems, branches, or objects, by filling gaps, flooding adjacent areas, and extending from borders, likely representing organic structures like plants or trees in a logic puzzle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify and fully fill vertical "stem" columns starting from any 4 clue, extending downward (or fully if isolated), but only in non-8 areas of the input—subtlety: stems may not span the entire height if blocked by 8's, and blocks of non-8 rows need grouping to determine fill range.
 * Horizontal and vertical gap filling between groups of non-8 cells only if both sides contain at least one 1 (indicating content) and at least one side has a 3 border—easy to miss: gaps must be strictly separated (no overlap), and filling only occurs in 8's without overwriting existing non-8's.
 * Flood fill from any 2 into orthogonally adjacent 1 or 3 cells that are still 8, but not into 8-only areas or other numbers—subtlety: this is iterative and can propagate changes, but must respect input boundaries (no filling pure 8 regions).
 * Edge extension from 3 borders outward (up/down for vertical, left/right for horizontal) only if the group has both 1 (content) and 2 (already filled)—key miss: extensions stop at grid edges or existing non-8's, and only apply to the outermost groups per row/column.
 * Iteration is crucial: all filling steps (gaps, flood, extensions) run in a loop until no changes, as each can enable the next (e.g., gap fill enables flood).
 * Input groups (rows/columns) ignore 8's as separators, treating consecutive non-8's as blocks—subtlety: empty rows/columns (all 8's) skip processing.
 * No overwriting of input non-8 cells; output starts as copy of 2/4 to 2, rest 8.
 * Potential for multiple components: solver handles per-row/column independently but flood connects across.
 * Subtle edge case: if no stem (no 4), no special stem fill, but other rules still apply.
 * Over-extension risk: extensions only if both 1 and 2 present, preventing filling empty bordered areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; no prior iterations to compare directly.
 * Stem filling works well: correctly identifies and fills vertical columns from 4, grouping non-8 blocks appropriately.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical) succeeds in training examples by bridging separated groups with 1's and 3's, but may underfill if iterations don't propagate fully (e.g., new 2's from one step enabling later gaps).
 * Flood fill is effective for connecting adjacent 1/3 areas but only after initial fills; subtlety missed in isolation: it doesn't fill pure 8 gaps without a 1/3 anchor.
 * Edge extensions handle outward growth from 3's correctly in training, but could overextend if 1/2 checks are too loose (though not observed here).
 * Overall loop iterates all steps until stable, which is key and worked for all training examples (all CORRECT).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_stem, fill_stem, get_groups, fill_gaps, flood_fill, extend_edges) are relevant and build toward shape completion.
 * extract_objects not present or needed; no object extraction attempted, as puzzle seems rule-based filling rather than high-level parsing.

**Test output:**
 * The test output forms a coherent vertical stem in column 5 (0-indexed) with 2's from roughly row 4 to row 25, plus horizontal branches (e.g., row 4: 2's cols 1-7; row 5: 2's cols 1-9 and 15-19; similar patterns upward to row 2), tapering off at the bottom with isolated 2's in rows 17-25 col 5 only—looks like a tree trunk with upper branches, leaving lower grid as 8's.
 * This makes sense for a puzzle with a central stem (likely a 4 in input col 5) and horizontal clues (1's and 3's) in upper rows forming branches; flood and gap fills connected them without overfilling the bottom (possibly no 1/3 clues there).
 * No obvious errors: no stray 2's in empty areas, extensions seem bounded, and structure matches organic puzzle expectations (e.g., no full-grid fill).
 * Minor concern: rows 0-1 have partial 2's only in cols 16-17 (possibly a small branch or stem extension), which might be correct if input has isolated 1/3 there, but could indicate underfilling if a larger connection was expected—unknown without input grid, but consistent with rules.
 * Overall, test output looks correct and demonstrates understanding, as it avoids common pitfalls like filling all 8's or ignoring stems.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 02:47:31] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def get_groups_row(row: List[int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    groups = []
    n = len(row)
    j = 0
    while j < n:
        if row[j] == 8:
            j += 1
            continue
        s = j
        j += 1
        while j < n and row[j] != 8:
            j += 1

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:48:19] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a logic puzzle similar to a nonogram or region-filling grid (e.g., Nurikabe or a custom deduction puzzle), where the input grid contains clues (1 for interior/object cells, 3 for borders/edges, 4 for special stem markers, 2 for pre-filled regions, and 8 for unknown/empty cells), and the goal is to deduce and fill unknown cells (8s) with 2s to complete connected regions or objects while respecting separation by empties and border rules. The program iteratively applies deduction rules to propagate fillings from clues and pre-fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions or "objects" are defined as contiguous groups of non-8 cells (clues 1,2,3,4), separated by 8s; these groups must be analyzed horizontally and vertically for connections, gaps, and extensions.
 * Gaps between adjacent groups can be filled with 2s only if both groups contain at least one 1 (interior clue) and at least one bordering group ends with a 3 (border clue), indicating a continuous region across the gap.
 * Flood fill propagates 2s from known 2s into adjacent 8s only if the target cell's clue is 1 or 3 (part of an object), but not into pure empties or other clues; this must be careful to avoid overfilling disconnected areas.
 * Special handling for "stem" columns identified by 4s: these seem to indicate a vertical backbone that should be filled starting from the top of the first non-8 block downward, potentially spanning the entire height if it's a single continuous block.
 * Extensions from borders: If a group has a 3 at its edge (left/right for horizontal, top/bottom for vertical) and contains both a 1 and a known 2, extend filling into adjacent 8s beyond the border in that direction, simulating region growth.
 * Iteration is key: Rules must be applied in a loop until no changes occur, as propagations can chain (e.g., gap fill enables flood fill, which enables extension).
 * Pre-filled 2s and 4s are copied directly and treated as known; 4s are not propagated as 2s but used only for stem detection.
 * Subtlety: Groups are strictly contiguous non-8 sequences; single-cell groups or isolated 1/3s may not trigger fills without adjacent 2s or borders. Avoid filling into areas without any 1/3 support, as 8s outside objects should remain 8 (empties).
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns (all 8s) skip processing; stems with multiple disconnected blocks start filling from the topmost block but only downward; no diagonal connections (only orthogonal).
 * Potential misses: Over-reliance on borders (3s) without confirming object presence (1s); incomplete flood fill that doesn't revisit after initial queue; failure to handle stems that don't span full height or have gaps.

(Note: Other functions like fill_horizontal_gaps, fill_vertical_gaps, extend_horizontal, extend_vertical, and the stem-filling logic in program() are also helpful and build on these, but the group extraction and flood fill are core building blocks. The overall program() wrapper with iteration loop is essential for chaining rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly identifying stems via 4s, filling gaps between clue groups with 1s and 3-borders, propagating via flood fill into 1/3 areas, and extending from borders when groups had mixed 1s and 2s.
 * Worked well for cases with single continuous stems and horizontal/vertical propagations, as evidenced by 100% training accuracy.
 * Stem detection and downward filling from the topmost non-8 block in the 4-column is a key insight that likely succeeded in training.
 * Gap-filling logic correctly requires both adjacent groups to have 1s and at least one 3-border, preventing invalid connections.
 * Iterative loop ensures changes propagate fully, which was crucial for training cases with chained deductions.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., get_groups_row/col, flood_fill) are relevant and functional, though the stem block-merging logic assumes single-block stems for full-height fill, which might be a subtlety.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills a vertical stem in column 5 (index 5, 0-based) with 2s starting from row 1 downward across all 27 rows, which aligns with stem rules if a 4 was present there and it formed a single block.
 * Horizontal fills create a rough "tree-like" or "structure" shape: e.g., row 3 has 2s in cols 3-6, row 4 extends to cols 2-7, row 5 to cols 1-8, rows 6-7 fill cols 1-19 partially, row 8 mirrors row 5, etc., and a vertical band in cols 16-18 with 2s in most rows, suggesting gap-fills and extensions worked for a central object.
 * However, the output does not look fully correct or complete: ~70-80% of the grid remains 8s (e.g., entire right side cols 20-26 are all 8s except sparse 2s, top rows 0-2 have minimal fills, bottom rows 18-26 have only stem 2s), indicating potential misses in flood fill propagation, vertical extensions, or gap fills for disconnected or edge objects.
 * Specific differences: Rows 0-2 have only sparse 2s in cols 16-17, but if the input has 1/3 clues there, flood fill should have expanded more; row 14 has 2s in cols 14-18 but not extended left/right despite apparent group patterns; no fills in cols 0-0 or 19+ suggest missed horizontal extensions from 3-borders or incomplete iteration.
 * The output makes partial sense for a sparse puzzle with a tall stem and one main object, but it seems under-filled compared to what iterative rules should achieve if the input has multiple 1/3 groups—likely missing chained vertical gap fills or flood into upper/lower extensions, leaving isolated 8s within clue areas.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 02:48:33] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

The following lists only consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** provided train examples (inputs 1-4). These are limited to obvious, direct relationships between elements (e.g., positional adjacency, count correlations, or transformation consistencies). No high-level interpretation or puzzle solution is included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., absolute pixel counts without clear ties, semantic meanings) are excluded. Connections that vary or are not present in every example are omitted. Unknowns (e.g., precise causal mechanisms) are noted explicitly without speculation.

#### 1. **Green and Blue Elements (Positional and Count-Based Interaction)**
   - Number of Green elements = number of Blue elements = number of holes in the Maroon background (1:1:1 ratio in every input).
     - Train 1: 1 Green, 1 Blue, Maroon holes=1.
     - Train 2: 4 Greens, 4 Blues, Maroon holes=4.
     - Train 3: 3 Greens, 3 Blues, Maroon holes=3.
     - Train 4: 2 Greens, 2 Blues, Maroon holes=2.
   - Each Green is positionally connected to a unique Blue: Green bbox is vertically adjacent (atop, y-coordinate directly above or overlapping in vertical projection) or horizontally adjacent (same or neighboring x-range) to its associated Blue's bbox.
     - Consistent across all pairs in every input; no unpaired Greens or Blues.
   - **Transformation effect**: All Greens and Blues are absent in every output (removed entirely), suggesting their positions/counts influence Maroon/Red changes (details unknown).

#### 2. **Yellow and Red Elements (Positional Interaction)**
   - Yellow is always a single-pixel element (pixels=1, holes=0).
   - Red is always a short vertical bar (pixels=2 or 3, holes=0) directly below the Yellow: same x-coordinate (column), starting at y = Yellow's y + 1, extending 2-3 pixels downward.
     - Train 1: Yellow x=8 y=9; Red x=8 y=10-12.
     - Train 2: Yellow x=10 y=20; Red x=10 y=21-22.
     - Train 3: Yellow x=16 y=20; Red x=16 y=21-22.
     - Train 4: Yellow x=5 y=19; Red x=5 y=20-22.
   - No other positional variations; this vertical stacking is identical in structure across all inputs.
   - **Transformation effect**: Yellow is absent in every output (removed). Input Red's x-position is included within the output Red's horizontal bbox range (output Red always spans vertically near full height, but horizontal extent encompasses input Red's x).
     - Train 1: Input x=8 → output Red x=8 to 8.
     - Train 2: Input x=10 → output Red x=7 to 21 (includes 10).
     - Train 3: Input x=16 → output Red x=0 to 19 (includes 16).
     - Train 4: Input x=5 → output Red x=2 to 21 (includes 5).

#### 3. **Maroon Background (Count and Structural Interaction with Greens/Blues)**
   - Maroon is always a single large component covering the full canvas bbox (e.g., [0,0,width,height]), with holes >0 in every input.
   - Holes in Maroon are directly tied to Green-Blue pairs (see #1): hole count = number of pairs, consistent in every input.
     - Holes likely correspond to regions containing Green-Blue pairs (positional overlap or enclosure, based on bboxes), but exact spatial mapping unknown.
   - No other elements (Yellow/Red) create additional holes; they are positioned within Maroon's bbox but do not alter hole count.
   - **Transformation effect**: Maroon always becomes exactly two separate components in every output, both with holes=0 (all holes filled/resolved).
     - Each output Maroon spans full vertical height (y=0 to max y).
     - Output Maroons' horizontal bboxes are positioned around or adjacent to the output Red (one typically left-leaning, one right-leaning, with possible bbox overlap but separate connectivity).
     - Total output Maroon pixels ≈ input Maroon pixels (minor variations, possibly due to boundary adjustments), suggesting some Maroon area is preserved but restructured.
     - The split into two components is consistently influenced by output Red's position (which ties back to input Yellow/Red x via #2).

#### 4. **Red and Maroon (Transformation Interaction)**
   - Input Red (tied to Yellow via #2) influences output Red placement (x-range inclusion, as in #2).
   - Output Red is always a single component (holes=0), absent in inputs except as the small bar.
     - Spans most/all vertical extent (y ≈0 to max y) in every output.
     - Horizontal bbox varies (width 1 to 19+), but always includes input Red's x and is positioned centrally relative to the canvas.
   - Output Red interacts with output Maroons: Red's bbox separates or overlaps the two Maroon bboxes horizontally, restructuring the single input Maroon into two.
     - Consistent in every output; no case with 1 or 3+ Maroons.
   - **Unknown**: Exact horizontal extent of output Red (varies; possibly tied to Green-Blue pair positions, e.g., spanning their collective x-range, but not consistently explainable from data—e.g., Train 1 pairs at x=1-4 → Red width=1 at x=8; Train 2 pairs at x=1-21 → Red width=14).

#### 5. **Global Transformation Consistencies (Cross-Element Effects)**
   - All inputs have exactly one Yellow-Red pair, multiple Green-Blue pairs, and one Maroon.
   - All outputs have exactly: two Maroons (holes=0, full height), one Red (holes=0, near-full height), and no Greens/Blues/Yellow.
     - Total components reduce from ~6-10 (input) to 3 (output).
   - Positional effects propagate: Input Green-Blue positions → Maroon holes; input Yellow-Red position → output Red/Maroon split.
   - No color changes between elements (e.g., no Green→Red); only removal (Green/Blue/Yellow) or expansion (Red) or restructuring (Maroon).
   - **Unknown**: How Green-Blue pair positions/sizes precisely determine output Red's width/shape or pixel count (varies non-linearly; e.g., more pairs → wider Red in some cases, but not directly proportional; cannot explain without further data).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no reliable color→position effects, no hole count→color changes, no silhouette/edge interactions explainable from data). Elements like individual bbox dimensions or pixel densities do not show uniform connections across all examples.

[2025-10-02 02:50:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

The following lists only consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** provided train examples (inputs 1-4). These are limited to obvious, direct relationships between elements (e.g., positional adjacency, count correlations, or transformation consistencies). No high-level interpretation or puzzle solution is included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., absolute pixel counts without clear ties, semantic meanings) are excluded. Connections that vary or are not present in every example are omitted. Unknowns (e.g., precise causal mechanisms) are noted explicitly without speculation.

#### 1. **Green and Blue Elements (Positional and Count-Based Interaction)**
   - Number of Green elements = number of Blue elements = number of holes in the Maroon background (1:1:1 ratio in every input).
     - Train 1: 1 Green, 1 Blue, Maroon holes=1.
     - Train 2: 4 Greens, 4 Blues, Maroon holes=4.
     - Train 3: 3 Greens, 3 Blues, Maroon holes=3.
     - Train 4: 2 Greens, 2 Blues, Maroon holes=2.
   - Each Green is positionally connected to a unique Blue: Green bbox is vertically adjacent (atop, y-coordinate directly above or overlapping in vertical projection) or horizontally adjacent (same or neighboring x-range) to its associated Blue's bbox.
     - Consistent across all pairs in every input; no unpaired Greens or Blues.
   - **Transformation effect**: All Greens and Blues are absent in every output (removed entirely), suggesting their positions/counts influence Maroon/Red changes (details unknown).

#### 2. **Yellow and Red Elements (Positional Interaction)**
   - Yellow is always a single-pixel element (pixels=1, holes=0).
   - Red is always a short vertical bar (pixels=2 or 3, holes=0) directly below the Yellow: same x-coordinate (column), starting at y = Yellow's y + 1, extending 2-3 pixels downward.
     - Train 1: Yellow x=8 y=9; Red x=8 y=10-12.
     - Train 2: Yellow x=10 y=20; Red x=10 y=21-22.
     - Train 3: Yellow x=16 y=20; Red x=16 y=21-22.
     - Train 4: Yellow x=5 y=19; Red x=5 y=20-22.
   - No other positional variations; this vertical stacking is identical in structure across all inputs.
   - **Transformation effect**: Yellow is absent in every output (removed). Input Red's x-position is included within the output Red's horizontal bbox range (output Red always spans vertically near full height, but horizontal extent encompasses input Red's x).
     - Train 1: Input x=8 → output Red x=8 to 8.
     - Train 2: Input x=10 → output Red x=7 to 21 (includes 10).
     - Train 3: Input x=16 → output Red x=0 to 19 (includes 16).
     - Train 4: Input x=5 → output Red x=2 to 21 (includes 5).

#### 3. **Maroon Background (Count and Structural Interaction with Greens/Blues)**
   - Maroon is always a single large component covering the full canvas bbox (e.g., [0,0,width,height]), with holes >0 in every input.
   - Holes in Maroon are directly tied to Green-Blue pairs (see #1): hole count = number of pairs, consistent in every input.
     - Holes likely correspond to regions containing Green-Blue pairs (positional overlap or enclosure, based on bboxes), but exact spatial mapping unknown.
   - No other elements (Yellow/Red) create additional holes; they are positioned within Maroon's bbox but do not alter hole count.
   - **Transformation effect**: Maroon always becomes exactly two separate components in every output, both with holes=0 (all holes filled/resolved).
     - Each output Maroon spans full vertical height (y=0 to max y).
     - Output Maroons' horizontal bboxes are positioned around or adjacent to the output Red (one typically left-leaning, one right-leaning, with possible bbox overlap but separate connectivity).
     - Total output Maroon pixels ≈ input Maroon pixels (minor variations, possibly due to boundary adjustments), suggesting some Maroon area is preserved but restructured.
     - The split into two components is consistently influenced by output Red's position (which ties back to input Yellow/Red x via #2).

#### 4. **Red and Maroon (Transformation Interaction)**
   - Input Red (tied to Yellow via #2) influences output Red placement (x-range inclusion, as in #2).
   - Output Red is always a single component (holes=0), absent in inputs except as the small bar.
     - Spans most/all vertical extent (y ≈0 to max y) in every output.
     - Horizontal bbox varies (width 1 to 19+), but always includes input Red's x and is positioned centrally relative to the canvas.
   - Output Red interacts with output Maroons: Red's bbox separates or overlaps the two Maroon bboxes horizontally, restructuring the single input Maroon into two.
     - Consistent in every output; no case with 1 or 3+ Maroons.
   - **Unknown**: Exact horizontal extent of output Red (varies; possibly tied to Green-Blue pair positions, e.g., spanning their collective x-range, but not consistently explainable from data—e.g., Train 1 pairs at x=1-4 → Red width=1 at x=8; Train 2 pairs at x=1-21 → Red width=14).

#### 5. **Global Transformation Consistencies (Cross-Element Effects)**
   - All inputs have exactly one Yellow-Red pair, multiple Green-Blue pairs, and one Maroon.
   - All outputs have exactly: two Maroons (holes=0, full height), one Red (holes=0, near-full height), and no Greens/Blues/Yellow.
     - Total components reduce from ~6-10 (input) to 3 (output).
   - Positional effects propagate: Input Green-Blue positions → Maroon holes; input Yellow-Red position → output Red/Maroon split.
   - No color changes between elements (e.g., no Green→Red); only removal (Green/Blue/Yellow) or expansion (Red) or restructuring (Maroon).
   - **Unknown**: How Green-Blue pair positions/sizes precisely determine output Red's width/shape or pixel count (varies non-linearly; e.g., more pairs → wider Red in some cases, but not directly proportional; cannot explain without further data).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no reliable color→position effects, no hole count→color changes, no silhouette/edge interactions explainable from data). Elements like individual bbox dimensions or pixel densities do not show uniform connections across all examples.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:59:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, 4=yellow, 8=maroon) where the goal is to transform the input grid by identifying a key "red column" based on the position of yellow cells (4) relative to initial red bars (2), replacing non-red/non-maroon elements with maroon (8) while preserving or extending reds in a way that fills vertical gaps or connects components in that column, resulting in a output grid that emphasizes extended red structures amid a maroon background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The yellow (4) cell(s) mark the "red column" as the vertical column containing the yellow, which is positioned above or near initial red bars (2); this column needs vertical extension of reds to full height or to fill "holes" (gaps of non-red cells), but not necessarily overwriting everything indiscriminately—initial reds elsewhere must be preserved if they form connected bars or components.
 * Non-red/non-maroon cells (1,3,4) are replaced with maroon (8), but initial reds (2) are preserved globally, not just in the red column; the extension only affects the identified column to resolve vertical discontinuities (e.g., filling gaps between red bars in that column).
 * Subtle element: The puzzle may involve "stacking" or "dropping" reds downward from the yellow's position, connecting multiple horizontal red bars into vertical structures only in the target column, while horizontal reds in other columns remain if they are initial; overlooking this leads to over-extension (full columns of 2s) or loss of multi-column red shapes.
 * Grids have varying widths (e.g., 22-27 columns) and heights (e.g., 23-27 rows), so code must handle dynamic dimensions; assume rectangular grids.
 * Potential for multiple yellows or complex red shapes: Examples show single yellow per case, but expectations have asymmetric red extensions (e.g., partial vertical fills, not full height everywhere).
 * Easy to miss: The transformation resolves "splits" in maroon by filling the red column, but does not create new horizontal reds—only vertical extension in the target column; initial reds outside the column stay as-is after maroon replacement.
 * All cells become 8 except preserved/extended 2s; yellow (4) itself becomes 8 after identifying the column.
 * Considerations across attempts: Finding the yellow column works (as in example 1), but uniform full-height overwrite fails when expectations show partial fills or preserved horizontal bars; need to detect initial red positions in the column and fill only gaps between them, not the entire column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes modular functions, but only `find_red_column` is reliably helpful (correctly identifies the yellow-based column in all cases). The other functions are broken or overly simplistic: `remove_non_maroon_and_red` correctly preserves initial 2s but sets too much to 8 without considering post-extension needs; `extend_red_to_full_height` is unhelpful/broken as it blindly fills the entire column, ignoring gap-filling logic and causing over-extension in examples 2-4 and test.

```python
from typing import List

def find_red_column(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Rule: The red column is the column containing the yellow (4) cell, which is stacked above the initial red bar (2s)."""
    height = len(g)
    width = len(g[0]) if height > 0 else 0
    red_col = -1
    for r in range(height):
        for c in range(width):
            if g[r][c] == 4:
                red_col = c
                break
        if red_col != -1:
            break
    # Verify with 2s if needed, but assume unique 4
    return red_col
```

No other functions from this attempt are helpful; `remove_non_maroon_and_red` and `extend_red_to_full_height` should be revised or replaced (e.g., with a gap-filling function that scans the target column for 2-regions and fills non-2 gaps between min/max row of 2s in that column). No extraction functions for objects (e.g., detecting red bars or components) were provided, but one could be added to identify connected red regions per column for better gap detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program) correctly handled training example 1 by identifying the yellow column and extending it fully, matching the expected simple vertical red fill amid maroon.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated a single full-height column of 2s (column ~10, all rows 2s, rest 8s), but expected preserves multiple horizontal red bars (e.g., rows 4-5 have wide 2s from col 8-21, rows 0-2/6-7/14-23 have partial 2s in cols 19-20 or col 9-10) and only partially fills vertically in the yellow's column (not full height; e.g., gaps remain as 8s in upper/lower parts)—over-extension erased horizontal structures and didn't match asymmetric fills.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated a single full-height column of 2s (column 16, all rows 2s, rest 8s), but expected has multiple horizontal red bars (e.g., rows 4-5/13-14/16-17 have wide 2s across cols 2-20, with vertical connections in cols 4-5 and 16-19) and partial vertical fills only between initial red bars in the target column(s)—ignored multi-column connections and overfilled.
 * Failed training example 4: Generated a single full-height column of 2s (column 5, all rows 2s, rest 8s), but expected preserves horizontal reds (e.g., rows 5-7/21-22 have wide 2s across cols 2-21) and shows partial vertical extension in column 5 (e.g., fills from row 3 downward but not fully, with horizontals intact)—lost initial horizontal reds outside the column.
 * Overall: The column identification via yellow works (core element), but the maroon replacement + full extension logic is broken, as it doesn't preserve or connect initial red bars properly; it treats the target column as uniform fill instead of gap-filling between existing 2s. No object extraction was used, which might help detect red components. Subtleties like partial fills (not full height) and horizontal preservation were missed. The `program` composition is a good structure but needs refined extension logic (e.g., find min/max row with 2s in target column and fill only between them).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows a single full-height column of 2s (column 5, across all ~27 rows, rest 8s), which follows the attempt's flawed full-extension logic but likely mismatches the expected pattern based on training examples—expectations consistently show partial vertical fills (e.g., only between initial red bars) and preserved horizontal reds in other columns, not a uniform column overwrite. Without the test input grid, it's hard to confirm exact mismatches, but this over-simplistic output ignores subtleties like gap-filling only where reds are "stacked" below yellow, potentially erasing complex shapes; it makes sense under the attempt's rules but not the puzzle's, as it would fail similarly to examples 2-4 (e.g., if test has horizontal reds or partial stacks, they'd be lost to 8s except in col 5).

[2025-10-02 02:59:29] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 03:00:36] Response:
### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., position, holes, bbox adjacency) where elements clearly interact or affect each other in a repeatable way. No high-level interpretations or puzzle-solving attempts are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated pixel counts without positional ties) are excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., varying pixel totals or non-adjacent placements) are noted as unknown where they cannot be reliably connected.

1. **Yellow and Red (positional interaction via vertical alignment)**:
   - In every input, the Yellow shape (always holes=0, pixels=1, single-pixel bbox like [x,y,x,y]) is positioned directly above the Red shape, sharing the exact same x-coordinate range (bbox x-min = x-max).
   - Red (always holes=0, pixels=2-3, vertical rectangle bbox [x,y+1,x+height,bottom]) starts immediately below Yellow (Red y-min = Yellow y-max + 1).
   - In every output, Yellow is absent; Red is transformed (bbox expands vertically to near or at y=0, pixels increase significantly to 13-111, sometimes horizontally wider).
   - Consistent effect: Yellow's position anchors Red's x in input; Red's transformation incorporates or extends beyond Yellow's position.

2. **Green shapes and Blue shapes (positional interaction via adjacency)**:
   - In every input, all Green shapes (holes=0, pixels=1-2, small bbox 1-2 units wide/tall) are positioned adjacent to at least one Blue shape (bboxes touch edges or share boundary coordinates without full overlap; e.g., Green's x-max = Blue's x-min or y-ranges align closely).
   - Examples of consistency: Input 1 (Green [2,1,3,1] above Blue [1,2,4,5]); Input 2 (multiple Greens touching Blues at edges like [2,3,3,3] near [1,4,4,6]); Input 3 (Greens bridging or beside Blues like [14,4,14,5] between [2,2,7,6] and [15,2,19,7]); Input 4 (Green [7,5,7,6] right of [2,3,6,8], Green [13,13,13,13] left of [14,12,16,14]).
   - In every output, all Greens and Blues are absent (no trace in colors, bboxes, or pixels).
   - Consistent effect: Greens' positions are tied to Blues' edges/silhouettes; both disappear together, suggesting joint interaction (exact transformation unknown).

3. **Maroon and other shapes (containment and holes interaction)**:
   - In every input, Maroon (holes >0, varying 1-4, bbox covers full canvas [0,0,width,height]) contains all other shapes (Greens, Blues, Yellow, Red) within its bbox (no shapes outside Maroon bounds).
   - All non-Maroon shapes (Greens, Blues, Yellow, Red) are hole-free (holes=0).
   - In every output, Maroon splits into 2+ components (all holes=0), with bboxes covering the full canvas collectively; Red remains but enlarged and positioned between/among Maroon pieces (e.g., overlapping or adjacent bboxes).
   - Consistent effect: Non-Maroon shapes' positions within Maroon affect its splitting (Maroon holes always reduced to 0); Red's bbox interacts with Maroon splits (Red spans across former Maroon areas). Number of Maroon output components (2-3) loosely ties to input hole count (1-4) but not exactly consistent (unknown precise mapping).

### Unknown or Non-Consistent Elements
- Pixel counts: Vary widely (e.g., Blue pixels 7-50, Red output 13-111) without clear positional ties across all examples; no consistent transformation rule identifiable.
- Color-to-color effects: No direct color changes (e.g., Green/Blue never become Red/Maroon consistently); disappearances are total but mechanism unknown.
- Specific bbox transformations: Expansions (e.g., Red height from 2-3 to full canvas) occur but depend on varying factors like input x-position, not consistent across all (e.g., Input 1 Red stays narrow at x=8; Input 2 widens around x=10).
- Hole-to-shape count: Maroon input holes (1-4) roughly align with Blue count (1-3) in most but not all (Input 2: 4 holes, 3 Blues); potential interaction but inconsistent, so unknown.
- No forced connections: No evidence of colors affecting movement (e.g., Green position never consistently changes Blue color) or silhouette edges causing specific transforms (e.g., Blue edges don't predict exact Maroon splits in every case). Greens/Blues do not interact directly with Yellow/Red positions across all examples.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:00:36] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., position, holes, bbox adjacency) where elements clearly interact or affect each other in a repeatable way. No high-level interpretations or puzzle-solving attempts are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated pixel counts without positional ties) are excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., varying pixel totals or non-adjacent placements) are noted as unknown where they cannot be reliably connected.

1. **Yellow and Red (positional interaction via vertical alignment)**:
   - In every input, the Yellow shape (always holes=0, pixels=1, single-pixel bbox like [x,y,x,y]) is positioned directly above the Red shape, sharing the exact same x-coordinate range (bbox x-min = x-max).
   - Red (always holes=0, pixels=2-3, vertical rectangle bbox [x,y+1,x+height,bottom]) starts immediately below Yellow (Red y-min = Yellow y-max + 1).
   - In every output, Yellow is absent; Red is transformed (bbox expands vertically to near or at y=0, pixels increase significantly to 13-111, sometimes horizontally wider).
   - Consistent effect: Yellow's position anchors Red's x in input; Red's transformation incorporates or extends beyond Yellow's position.

2. **Green shapes and Blue shapes (positional interaction via adjacency)**:
   - In every input, all Green shapes (holes=0, pixels=1-2, small bbox 1-2 units wide/tall) are positioned adjacent to at least one Blue shape (bboxes touch edges or share boundary coordinates without full overlap; e.g., Green's x-max = Blue's x-min or y-ranges align closely).
   - Examples of consistency: Input 1 (Green [2,1,3,1] above Blue [1,2,4,5]); Input 2 (multiple Greens touching Blues at edges like [2,3,3,3] near [1,4,4,6]); Input 3 (Greens bridging or beside Blues like [14,4,14,5] between [2,2,7,6] and [15,2,19,7]); Input 4 (Green [7,5,7,6] right of [2,3,6,8], Green [13,13,13,13] left of [14,12,16,14]).
   - In every output, all Greens and Blues are absent (no trace in colors, bboxes, or pixels).
   - Consistent effect: Greens' positions are tied to Blues' edges/silhouettes; both disappear together, suggesting joint interaction (exact transformation unknown).

3. **Maroon and other shapes (containment and holes interaction)**:
   - In every input, Maroon (holes >0, varying 1-4, bbox covers full canvas [0,0,width,height]) contains all other shapes (Greens, Blues, Yellow, Red) within its bbox (no shapes outside Maroon bounds).
   - All non-Maroon shapes (Greens, Blues, Yellow, Red) are hole-free (holes=0).
   - In every output, Maroon splits into 2+ components (all holes=0), with bboxes covering the full canvas collectively; Red remains but enlarged and positioned between/among Maroon pieces (e.g., overlapping or adjacent bboxes).
   - Consistent effect: Non-Maroon shapes' positions within Maroon affect its splitting (Maroon holes always reduced to 0); Red's bbox interacts with Maroon splits (Red spans across former Maroon areas). Number of Maroon output components (2-3) loosely ties to input hole count (1-4) but not exactly consistent (unknown precise mapping).

### Unknown or Non-Consistent Elements
- Pixel counts: Vary widely (e.g., Blue pixels 7-50, Red output 13-111) without clear positional ties across all examples; no consistent transformation rule identifiable.
- Color-to-color effects: No direct color changes (e.g., Green/Blue never become Red/Maroon consistently); disappearances are total but mechanism unknown.
- Specific bbox transformations: Expansions (e.g., Red height from 2-3 to full canvas) occur but depend on varying factors like input x-position, not consistent across all (e.g., Input 1 Red stays narrow at x=8; Input 2 widens around x=10).
- Hole-to-shape count: Maroon input holes (1-4) roughly align with Blue count (1-3) in most but not all (Input 2: 4 holes, 3 Blues); potential interaction but inconsistent, so unknown.
- No forced connections: No evidence of colors affecting movement (e.g., Green position never consistently changes Blue color) or silhouette edges causing specific transforms (e.g., Blue edges don't predict exact Maroon splits in every case). Greens/Blues do not interact directly with Yellow/Red positions across all examples.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:24:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid representation of tree-like structures (trunks and branches) using numbers: likely 1/2 for red elements (solid trunk/branch), 3/4 for green/yellow elements (leafy or branch tips), with the goal of filling valid connected tree components into 2's (solid fill) while setting invalid or unconnected parts to 8's (background/empty), following rules for trunk identification, horizontal/vertical propagation, intersections, and merges without overfilling disconnected or invalid branches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Trunk is a vertical column identified by the lowest 2 or 4; it must be filled solidly from the highest intersection point downward, but not above unless connected via branches.
 * Branches (horizontal spans of 1/3 or 2/4) only fill if they intersect the trunk or are connected via propagation; disconnected branches stay as 8's after final cleanup.
 * Yellow (4) treats as red (2) initially for filling, but original grid (original_g) must be preserved for checks like green-only bridges or top-row extensions.
 * Propagation is vertical (up/down) along connected 1/3 spans triggered by 2's above/below, but must expand horizontally to full connected spans without overextending to disconnected areas.
 * Merging: Multiple 2 spans in a row merge only if bridged by original green (3) in at least one spanning segment that touches the trunk; otherwise, they remain separate or get cleared to 8.
 * Green components (3/4) fill differently: left/top greens skip if no above connection (isolated), but right/top greens may extend upward if filled; avoid filling isolated green blobs.
 * Subtle: Highest intersection is the topmost row with 1/3 in trunk column; stem fill starts there downward. Avoid overpropagation in loops (code uses h iterations, which may be excessive). Final step clears all remaining 1/3 to 8, so only validated 2's survive.
 * Easy to miss: Branches don't fill if they don't touch trunk directly or via propagation; no diagonal connections. Top-row greens on right may extend full height upward only if already filled. In multi-trunk-like setups, only one trunk column is chosen (lowest). Overfilling happens when propagation/merging ignores green-bridge requirements or expands left unnecessarily for non-trunk-touching greens.
 * All attempts must handle varying widths/heights; copy grid to avoid mutating input. Unfilled areas default to 8, but input may have other numbers—assume 0/empty is 8-equivalent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import copy

def find_trunk_column(grid):
  # Identifies the trunk column by scanning bottom-up for first 2 or 4 column.
  # Helpful for core trunk detection; works well if trunk is unique/lowest.
  h = len(grid)
  w = len(grid[0])
  trunk_col = -1
  for r in range(h - 1, -1, -1):
    for c in range(w):
      if grid[r][c] == 2 or grid[r][c] == 4:
        trunk_col = c
        break
    if trunk_col != -1:
      break
  return trunk_col
```

```python
def treat_yellow_as_red(grid):
  # Converts 4 to 2 globally; useful initial step but must use original_g for later checks.
  h = len(grid)
  w = len(grid[0])
  for r in range(h):
    for c in range(w):
      if grid[r][c] == 4:
        grid[r][c] = 2
  return grid
```

```python
def get_highest_intersect(grid, trunk_col):
  # Finds topmost row with 1/3 in trunk; essential for stem fill start.
  h = len(grid)
  highest = h
  for r in range(h):
    if grid[r][trunk_col] == 1 or grid[r][trunk_col] == 3:
      highest = min(highest, r)
  return highest
```

```python
def fill_intersecting_components(grid, trunk_col):
  # Fills horizontal 1/3 spans that touch trunk column to 2.
  # Helpful for direct branch fills; core but doesn't handle indirect connections.
  h = len(grid)
  w = len(grid[0])
  for r in range(h):
    if grid[r][trunk_col] == 1 or grid[r][trunk_col] == 3:
      left = trunk_col
      while left > 0 and grid[r][left - 1] in (1, 3):
        left -= 1
      right = trunk_col
      while right < w - 1 and grid[r][right + 1] in (1, 3):
        right += 1
      for c in range(left, right + 1):
        grid[r][c] = 2
  return grid
```

```python
def fill_stem(grid, highest_intersect, trunk_col):
  # Fills trunk column downward from highest intersect.
  # Essential for vertical trunk solidity; works if intersect is correct.
  h = len(grid)
  start_r = 0 if highest_intersect == len(grid) else highest_intersect
  for r in range(start_r, h):
    grid[r][trunk_col] = 2
  return grid
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it passed training example 1 (simple trunk/branches correctly filled without overfill), demonstrating core understanding of trunk detection, intersection filling, and stem fill.
 * Failed training 2: Overfilled row 3 (full 0-20 as 2's vs. expected only 9-10 and 19-20), rows 4-5 (extra left 2's at 1- vs. expected starting at 8), row 6 (extra 2-3 2's vs. none), rows 7-12/16-17 (persistent 9-10 2's without vertical connection vs. expected cleared to 8 in most), row 13 (8-11 vs. expected none), row 14 (7-11 vs. 8-? but shifted left), row 15 (8-11 vs. none); rows 0-2 extra 9-10 2's (disconnected, should be 8). Likely due to faulty fill_green_components expanding left unnecessarily and propagate_vertical over-spreading without green checks.
 * Failed training 3: Overfilled row 7 (0-5 2's vs. expected none there, should be 8's), row 8 (16-17 2's vs. 16-17 but wait, expected has 16-17 in row 7? Wait, mismatch in vertical: generated has extra trunk-like 2's in left without connection); row 12 (4-5 vs. expected 4-5 but propagate added extras?); rows 18-22 (16 single 2 vs. expected 16 single, but overfill in row 7 suggests propagation bug); unknown why row 7 left-filled when expected clears it—possibly apply_merge wrongly bridged without green.
 * Failed training 4: Overfilled rows 13-14 (full 0-17 2's vs. expected none in row 13, only trunk in 14? Wait, expected row 13 none, row 14 14-15 2's? No, expected has sparse; generated added extra horizontal in 13 from bad merge/propagate); rows 5-7 (extra right 2's in 13-21 vs. expected full but only if connected—overfill in row 5 13-21 when expected stops at 21? Lists show generated misses full row 5-6 connection); unknown blob shape mismatch in lower right (generated sparse 14 2's vs. expected full horizontal in some).
 * fill_green_components is buggy/not helpful: Skips left/top greens correctly but wrongly expands left to 0 for non-trunk greens, causing overfill (e.g., train 2 row 3 full); remove or fix skip logic for isolated greens.
 * propagate_vertical is somewhat helpful but over-iterates (h times may loop too much, spreading to disconnected); unhelpful as-is due to no boundary on expansion—add checks for trunk proximity.
 * apply_merge is broken: Merges spans if any has green bridge touching trunk, but applies globally per row without verifying all spans connect, leading to over-merges (e.g., train 2 row 3 full merge); not helpful without stricter per-span validation.
 * extend_top_green_right is unhelpful/broken: Only extends upward if already filled and top-row green on right, but condition grid[r][c]==2 triggers wrongly on non-top, causing vertical overfill (e.g., train 3 row 7); ignore or rewrite for true top-only (r==0).
 * Overall, core trunk/intersect/stem work (passed train 1), but green handling, propagation, and merging fail on disconnected/multi-branch cases, leaving extra 2's instead of 8's.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills several areas similar to training failures, e.g., row 3 full 0-15 2's (likely bad green expand/merge, should be sparser branches only touching trunk at ~16), rows 4-7 extra left 2's (1- vs. expected starting later, disconnected), row 12 full 0-15 2's (over-propagate from above without connection), row 14-15 extra right 16-21 2's (should be limited to trunk-touching spans), lower rows 18-26 single 5 2's (trunk?) but sparse without horizontal branches vs. expected fuller if connected—mismatches suggest same bugs as train 2/3 (over-expansion left/right without green bridges or top checks). It partially captures trunk at col 5 and right branches at 16-17, but extras make it invalid; account for multi-level branches and stricter connectivity to fix.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 03:26:06] Response:
### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements/properties observed across **all** train input/output pairs. These are limited to those that appear in every example without exception. I have excluded any speculative or inconsistent connections (e.g., no forced explanations for varying red shapes/sizes in outputs, as they are not uniform; no inclusion of irrelevant elements like the purple background, which remains static and non-interacting). Only direct, observable linkages are noted, such as position-to-position, count-to-count, or adjacency-based effects. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel redistribution or splitting logic) are flagged as such rather than explained.

1. **Yellow position → Input red position**:
   - The yellow element (always a single-pixel square, positioned near the bottom of the canvas) directly determines the x-coordinate of the input red element.
   - Input red is always a small vertical bar (2-3 pixels high, 1 pixel wide) starting immediately below the yellow (same x, y = yellow.y + 1 to canvas bottom edge).
   - Consistent effect: Yellow acts as a "seed" for the input red's location; no other elements influence this.

2. **Blue components → Maroon holes (count and location)**:
   - The number of blue components (always 1-4 pixelated shapes, often square-like with 7-22 pixels) exactly matches the number of holes in the maroon element (holes = number of blues: 1 in train1, 4 in train2, 3 in train3, 2 in train4).
   - Blue bounding boxes (bbox) are always fully enclosed within the maroon's bbox, creating localized holes in the maroon at those positions.
   - Consistent effect: Blues interact with maroon by generating holes equal in count to blue instances; hole positions align with blue bbox locations. No other elements create holes.

3. **Green elements → Blue adjacency/attachment**:
   - All green elements (always small, 1-2 pixels, rectangular/square, total 1-4 instances) are positioned adjacent to or directly attached to a blue component (e.g., atop, beside, or at edges of a blue's bbox).
   - Each blue has at least one green attached; no greens exist without a nearby blue (within 1-2 units of blue bbox edges).
   - Consistent effect: Greens modify or accent blue shapes via position-based attachment; greens do not interact with maroon, yellow, or red independently. (Note: A single-pixel green in train4 is adjacent to the smaller blue, maintaining consistency.)

4. **Input colored elements (blues, greens, yellow, input red) → Output removal and pixel absorption**:
   - All blues, greens, yellow, and input red are completely absent in outputs.
   - Their combined pixel count (blues + greens + yellow + input red) is approximately preserved and redistributed into output maroons (2 instances, no holes) + output red (1 instance), with total output pixels ≈ input non-maroon pixels + input maroon pixels.
   - Consistent effect: These elements interact collectively by being "absorbed" into output maroons/red, filling previous maroon holes; exact redistribution (e.g., which pixels go to which output region) is unknown and varies.

5. **Yellow position → Output red position (partial influence)**:
   - The x-coordinate of the input yellow always falls within the x-range of the output red's bbox.
   - Output red (always 1 instance, variable size/shape, 13-111 pixels) incorporates or aligns with the input yellow's x in its horizontal span.
   - Consistent effect: Yellow position seeds or constrains the output red's x-placement; vertical extent and width vary (unknown transformation), but inclusion of yellow's x is universal. Output red does not interact with greens or blues directly in a consistent positional way.

6. **Maroon holes → Output maroon filling and multiplicity**:
   - Input maroon (always 1 instance, large bbox covering ~entire canvas, multiple holes) transforms into exactly 2 output maroon instances (no holes, smaller but overlapping bboxes covering similar total area).
   - Input holes are always filled in outputs, with pixel content redistributed between the 2 output maroons.
   - Consistent effect: Input maroon holes interact by being eliminated, resulting in hole-free output maroons; the split into exactly 2 components is tied to the overall transformation influenced by yellow/output red position (exact split mechanism unknown).

### Notes on Exclusions
- No consistent interactions involving colors changing directly (e.g., blue → red) or specific shape properties like edges/silhouettes affecting movement/transformation, as these vary or are not observable uniformly.
- Positions of blues/greens do not have a consistent direct effect on output red shape (e.g., widths vary without clear pattern tied to all examples).
- No isolated elements: All listed components interact as noted; standalone properties (e.g., maroon pixel counts alone) are irrelevant without connections.
- Unknowns: The precise logic for output red's width/height or how blue positions influence maroon splitting cannot be explained consistently across all examples without forcing unfit patterns.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:26:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements/properties observed across **all** train input/output pairs. These are limited to those that appear in every example without exception. I have excluded any speculative or inconsistent connections (e.g., no forced explanations for varying red shapes/sizes in outputs, as they are not uniform; no inclusion of irrelevant elements like the purple background, which remains static and non-interacting). Only direct, observable linkages are noted, such as position-to-position, count-to-count, or adjacency-based effects. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel redistribution or splitting logic) are flagged as such rather than explained.

1. **Yellow position → Input red position**:
   - The yellow element (always a single-pixel square, positioned near the bottom of the canvas) directly determines the x-coordinate of the input red element.
   - Input red is always a small vertical bar (2-3 pixels high, 1 pixel wide) starting immediately below the yellow (same x, y = yellow.y + 1 to canvas bottom edge).
   - Consistent effect: Yellow acts as a "seed" for the input red's location; no other elements influence this.

2. **Blue components → Maroon holes (count and location)**:
   - The number of blue components (always 1-4 pixelated shapes, often square-like with 7-22 pixels) exactly matches the number of holes in the maroon element (holes = number of blues: 1 in train1, 4 in train2, 3 in train3, 2 in train4).
   - Blue bounding boxes (bbox) are always fully enclosed within the maroon's bbox, creating localized holes in the maroon at those positions.
   - Consistent effect: Blues interact with maroon by generating holes equal in count to blue instances; hole positions align with blue bbox locations. No other elements create holes.

3. **Green elements → Blue adjacency/attachment**:
   - All green elements (always small, 1-2 pixels, rectangular/square, total 1-4 instances) are positioned adjacent to or directly attached to a blue component (e.g., atop, beside, or at edges of a blue's bbox).
   - Each blue has at least one green attached; no greens exist without a nearby blue (within 1-2 units of blue bbox edges).
   - Consistent effect: Greens modify or accent blue shapes via position-based attachment; greens do not interact with maroon, yellow, or red independently. (Note: A single-pixel green in train4 is adjacent to the smaller blue, maintaining consistency.)

4. **Input colored elements (blues, greens, yellow, input red) → Output removal and pixel absorption**:
   - All blues, greens, yellow, and input red are completely absent in outputs.
   - Their combined pixel count (blues + greens + yellow + input red) is approximately preserved and redistributed into output maroons (2 instances, no holes) + output red (1 instance), with total output pixels ≈ input non-maroon pixels + input maroon pixels.
   - Consistent effect: These elements interact collectively by being "absorbed" into output maroons/red, filling previous maroon holes; exact redistribution (e.g., which pixels go to which output region) is unknown and varies.

5. **Yellow position → Output red position (partial influence)**:
   - The x-coordinate of the input yellow always falls within the x-range of the output red's bbox.
   - Output red (always 1 instance, variable size/shape, 13-111 pixels) incorporates or aligns with the input yellow's x in its horizontal span.
   - Consistent effect: Yellow position seeds or constrains the output red's x-placement; vertical extent and width vary (unknown transformation), but inclusion of yellow's x is universal. Output red does not interact with greens or blues directly in a consistent positional way.

6. **Maroon holes → Output maroon filling and multiplicity**:
   - Input maroon (always 1 instance, large bbox covering ~entire canvas, multiple holes) transforms into exactly 2 output maroon instances (no holes, smaller but overlapping bboxes covering similar total area).
   - Input holes are always filled in outputs, with pixel content redistributed between the 2 output maroons.
   - Consistent effect: Input maroon holes interact by being eliminated, resulting in hole-free output maroons; the split into exactly 2 components is tied to the overall transformation influenced by yellow/output red position (exact split mechanism unknown).

### Notes on Exclusions
- No consistent interactions involving colors changing directly (e.g., blue → red) or specific shape properties like edges/silhouettes affecting movement/transformation, as these vary or are not observable uniformly.
- Positions of blues/greens do not have a consistent direct effect on output red shape (e.g., widths vary without clear pattern tied to all examples).
- No isolated elements: All listed components interact as noted; standalone properties (e.g., maroon pixel counts alone) are irrelevant without connections.
- Unknowns: The precise logic for output red's width/height or how blue positions influence maroon splitting cannot be explained consistently across all examples without forcing unfit patterns.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 03:39:16] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def find_yellow_column(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Find the column index of the yellow element (4)."""
    for row in g:
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 4:
                return j
    return 0  # Default if not found

def create_background_grid(h: int, w: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Create a grid filled with maroon (8)."""
    return [[8 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]

def fill_red_column(out: List[List[int]], x: int, h: int):
    """Fill the entire column x with red (2), based on yellow position influence."""
    for i in range(h):
        out[i][x] = 2

def remove_non_maroon_elements(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int):
    """Remove all colored elements (1,3,4) by setting to maroon (8), absorbing into background."""
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] in (1, 3, 4):
                out[i][j] = 8

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    out = create_background_grid(h, w)
    x = find_yellow_column(g)
    remove_non_maroon_elements(out, g, h, w)
    fill_red_column(out, x, h)
    return out
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:40:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (using numbers like 1 for green, 2 for red, 3 for blue, 4 for yellow, 8 for maroon background), and the output should be a new grid primarily filled with maroon (8), but with red (2) placed in positions that appear to trace, expand, or fill regions influenced by the yellow (4) element's position, possibly interacting with other colors like blue (3) or green (1) to form structured shapes such as lines, blobs, or paths. The goal is to "absorb" or transform non-background elements into red patterns that mimic or extend from the yellow's influence, while ensuring the rest remains maroon.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The yellow (4) element acts as a starting point or "seed" that influences red (2) placement, often along its column, but in complex cases, the red expands horizontally or forms connected shapes (e.g., horizontal bars or diagonal-ish fills) that interact with other input colors like blue (3) or green (1), suggesting rules for propagation, connection, or mirroring.
 * Non-maroon elements (1,3,4) in the input are "removed" or absorbed into the background (set to 8) unless they directly contribute to red filling; however, their positions may guide where red spreads, such as filling entire rows/columns or bounded regions around yellow.
 * Subtle element: Red patterns in expected outputs often form symmetric or expanding blobs (e.g., in train2, rows 4-5 have wide horizontal red fills from columns 8-21, while upper/lower rows have partial verticals at columns 19-20), indicating that yellow's column may trigger vertical fills that widen or connect horizontally based on nearby non-maroon clusters—easy to miss that it's not just a simple column fill.
 * Background is always initialized to maroon (8), and red (2) overrides only specific influenced areas; over-filling (e.g., entire columns without bounds) leads to excess red where expected outputs have isolated or partial fills.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., train2: 23 rows x 25 cols, train3: 23x22, train4/test: 27x27?), so code must handle dynamic h/w; yellow may not always exist or be unique, defaulting to no fill.
 * Other colors: Green (1) and blue (3) seem to define boundaries or extenders for red (e.g., in train3 expected, reds form a central cross-like shape around what might be yellow-influenced areas), but absorbing them to 8 first prevents direct copying—subtlety is that their positions indirectly shape red without preserving their color.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs show "eroded" or simplified versions of input structures, where connected components of non-8 cells near yellow get converted to red blobs, but disconnected ones stay 8; vertical alignment from yellow is core, but horizontal spread varies by row (e.g., wider in "middle" rows).
 * All training examples (except train1) have top/bottom rows fully 8, with red concentrated in mid-grid, suggesting vertical bounding or gradient-like expansion from yellow's row/column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_yellow_position(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the row and column index of the yellow element (4); returns (0,0) if not found."""
    for i, row in enumerate(g):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 4:
                return i, j
    return 0, 0
```

```python
def get_non_maroon_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Extract positions of non-maroon elements (1,3,4) to identify potential red-influence zones."""
    positions = []
    for i, row in enumerate(g):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if g[i][j] not in (0, 8):  # Assuming 0 is empty/white, but focus on 1,3,4
                positions.append((i, j))
    return positions
```

```python
def create_background_grid(h: int, w: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Create a grid filled with maroon (8)."""
    return [[8 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly handled train1 by filling the entire yellow column with red (2) on maroon (8) background after absorbing non-maroon to 8, matching a simple vertical line case.
 * Failed train2: Generated a uniform vertical red line in column 10 across all 23 rows, but expected has varied red patterns—e.g., rows 0-2 and 19-22 have partial reds only at columns 19-20, rows 4-5 have full horizontal reds from 8-21, rows 13-14 have shorter horizontals at 8-11, and row 16 has a single red at column 10; difference is lack of horizontal expansion or row-specific bounding, resulting in excess vertical red everywhere instead of clustered blobs.
 * Failed train3: Generated vertical red in column 16 across all 23 rows, but expected has complex central reds—e.g., rows 2-3 have partial at 16-19 and 4-7, rows 4-5 have wide horizontals from 2-21, row 14 has partial at 0-7 and 16, row 15 has full left horizontal 0-7; difference is over-filling the whole column vs. forming cross-like or bounded shapes, ignoring horizontal connections from other non-maroons.
 * Failed train4: Generated vertical red in column 5 across all 27 rows, but expected has mid-grid concentrations—e.g., rows 3-4 partial at 4-7, rows 5-6 full horizontals 2-21, rows 7-8 partial at 3-7, rows 9+ sparse vertical at 5; difference is uniform vertical fill vs. expanding horizontals in central rows, with top/bottom fully 8.
 * Function `remove_non_maroon_elements` is unhelpful/broken: It sets 1,3,4 to 8 on the output grid (which starts as 8 anyway), but doesn't use input positions to guide red placement—essentially does nothing useful beyond init; don't use it, as it ignores propagation rules.
 * Function `fill_red_column` is partially helpful for vertical base but insufficient alone, as it blindly fills entire column without row bounds or horizontal spread.
 * Function `find_yellow_column` is helpful for locating yellow but incomplete—needs row position too, and doesn't account for multi-yellow or interactions.
 * Overall, attempt shows basic understanding of yellow-as-trigger and maroon background, but misses core subtlety of shape formation (e.g., connected components or distance-based fill from yellow), leading to simplistic column-only outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it generates a single uniform vertical red (2) line in column 5 across all 27 rows on maroon (8), similar to failures in train2-4, suggesting the same over-simplification.
 * Based on patterns in incorrect trainings, expected test output likely has more complex red structures: probably horizontal expansions or bounded blobs around column 5 in mid-rows (e.g., wider fills in rows ~5-20, partial verticals elsewhere), with top/bottom rows fully 8 and no full-column red, as uniform verticals mismatched all complex expectations.
 * It fails to account for subtle horizontal propagation or bounding, making the output too sparse/simplistic—e.g., if test input has clustered non-maroons near yellow, reds should form shapes like in train3's cross, but here it's just a line, indicating the program doesn't detect or fill those.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Interactions

Based on analysis of all four train inputs and their corresponding outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train example (no exceptions) and demonstrate clear, direct interaction or effect (e.g., positional adjacency, transformation consistency, or property linkage). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., variable numbers/positions of Greens or Blues, variable output shapes for Red or Maroon splits) are excluded. Unknown or non-obvious transformations (e.g., how Greens/Blues specifically affect Maroon splitting or Red expansion) are noted as such rather than speculated upon.

1. **Yellow and Red positional adjacency and vertical stacking**:
   - In every input, the Yellow element (always 1 pixel, holes=0) is positioned directly above the top of the Red element (a thin vertical rectangle/bar, holes=0, 2-3 pixels tall).
   - The Red's bbox starts immediately below the Yellow's y-coordinate (no gap), sharing the same x-coordinate, creating a consistent "stacked" connection where Yellow sits atop Red.
   - This stack is preserved in outputs as the basis for Red's transformation (Red always expands from this position, but exact expansion rules are unknown and inconsistent in direction/scale).

2. **Red transformation from input stack to output vertical/horizontal expansion**:
   - In every input, Red originates as a small vertical bar (holes=0, pixels=2-3) directly below Yellow.
   - In every output, this Red expands significantly in size (pixels=13-111) while retaining holes=0, always starting from or near the input stack's position (x/y coordinates of the original Red/Yellow). It affects adjacent space by overwriting or dividing other elements (e.g., interacting with Maroon regions).
   - Expansion consistently fills toward the canvas edges or between other components, but the precise trigger/mechanism (e.g., influenced by Greens/Blues) is unknown and varies.

3. **Maroon background property change (holes) due to other elements**:
   - In every input, Maroon is a single large element (bbox covering full canvas [0,0,width,height], pixels=175-625) with holes>0 (1-4 holes), indicating interactions with overlaid elements (e.g., Greens/Blues/Yellow/Red "punching" or occupying space within it).
   - In every output, all Maroon instances have holes=0, showing a consistent "filling" or repair effect triggered by the overall transformation (likely interacting with Red expansion and possibly Greens/Blues positions, but exact cause unknown).
   - Maroon consistently splits into 1-2 instances in outputs, with bboxes adjusted to avoid overlap with expanded Red, but split patterns vary.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., direct Green-Blue connections, color-based movement, or hole count effects on specific shapes) are evident across all examples, as positions and effects vary without uniform linkage. Elements like Greens (always small, holes=0, pixels=1-2) and Blues (larger rectangles, holes=0, pixels=7-50) appear in every input but lack a consistent, direct interaction with each other or fixed effects on outputs beyond potential unknown influence on Maroon/Red. The pixelated/blocky rendering is uniform but does not interact with other properties.

[2025-10-02 03:40:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid containing markers like 4 (possibly indicating a starting point or key element) and transforming it into a new grid filled with 8s except for specific patterns of 2s that highlight or trace structures, paths, or shapes based on the positions and relationships of elements in the input grid. The current program oversimplifies this by only identifying the first 4 and filling its entire column with 2s, which works for simple vertical cases but fails to capture more complex, non-uniform patterns like diagonals, horizontals, or blob-like shapes seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid likely contains multiple 4s or other elements (e.g., implied by patterns in expects), and the output 2s form connected or symmetric shapes (e.g., lines, diamonds, or filled regions) rather than full columns or rows—e.g., in training 2, 2s appear in tapering diagonals and horizontal bands, not a single vertical line.
 * Subtlety: The position of the first 4 determines a starting column, but subsequent 2s propagate in multiple directions (horizontal, diagonal) or fill regions based on proximity or symmetry, as seen in training 3 and 4 where 2s form mirrored or expanding patterns around certain rows/columns.
 * Key consideration: Outputs preserve the grid dimensions and fill everything else with 8s, but 2s are not uniform—e.g., in training 2, upper rows have 2s only in positions 19-20, mid-rows expand to full horizontal bands of 2s from column 8, and lower rows taper back; this suggests rules involving distance from the 4, row-specific expansions, or object detection like "blobs" of connected cells.
 * Easy to miss: No full-column fills in complex cases; instead, 2s are sparse or patterned (e.g., training 3 has isolated pairs of 2s in columns 4-5 and 16-17, expanding to full rows in mid-sections); the program ignores row variations and multiple potential starting points.
 * Across attempts: Only vertical propagation is handled, missing horizontal/diagonal spreads; grid may have implicit "objects" (connected 4s or other values) that need extraction before patterning; ensure iteration stops at first 4 only if it's a unique trigger, but expects suggest processing all or contextual elements.
 * Considerations for test: Without input grid, assume similar to training 4 (vertical trigger in column 5); if input has a single 4 in column 5, full-column 2s might work, but patterns in other trainings imply it should expand horizontally or form shapes, not a uniform column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    new_g = [[8] * w for _ in range(h)]
    c = -1
    for idx in range(h * w):
        r = idx // w
        s = idx % w
        if g[r][s] == 4:
            c = s
            break
    if c != -1:
        for r in range(h):
            new_g[r][c] = 2
    return new_g
```
(This is the core function from the attempt; it's helpful for basic grid initialization and finding the first 4's column, but broken for non-vertical patterns—extend it with row-wise or diagonal filling logic.)

No other specialized functions (e.g., for object extraction) were provided; a potential future helper could be a function to find all 4 positions and compute distances or connections:
```python
def find_all_markers(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    markers = []
    for r in range(len(g)):
        for s in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[r][s] == 4:
                markers.append((r, s))
    return markers
```
(This would be helpful to detect multiple 4s if present, as single-4 assumption fails in complex expects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles training 1, likely a simple case where the single 4 triggers a full vertical column of 2s matching the expected output.
 * Failed training 2: Generated uniform column 10 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has varied patterns—e.g., rows 0-2 have 2s only at indices 19-20, row 3 at 9-10 and 19-20, rows 4-5 full horizontal 2s from index 8 to 21, then tapering; difference is lack of horizontal/diagonal expansion and row-specific widths (unknown why, possibly distance-based filling from 4).
 * Failed training 3: Generated full column 16 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected starts with all-8s rows 0-2, then pairs of 2s (e.g., row 2: indices 4-5 and 16-17), expands to full rows of 2s in mid-section (rows 4-5: indices 2-20), and tapers with isolated 2s; difference is over-filling the entire column instead of patterned, symmetric spreads around multiple points.
 * Failed training 4: Generated full column 5 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has all-8s in upper rows 0-2, then horizontal expansions (e.g., row 3: indices 4-5 as 2s, row 5: full row of 2s from 2-21, rows 6-7 same), tapering to single 2s in column 5 lower down; difference is ignoring horizontal fills and row variations, treating it as pure vertical.
 * The linear scan for first 4 works for simple cases but misses multi-4 or contextual rules; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed for "blobs" or connected components.
 * Function for grid init and column fill is partially helpful but not for the puzzle—extend to pattern generation; no unhelpful/broken functions beyond this oversimplification.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a uniform column 5 (index 5) of 2s across all 27 rows, with rest 8s, similar to training 4's generated but extended to a taller grid.
 * This does not look correct based on patterns in trainings 2-4, where even vertical triggers lead to non-uniform outputs (e.g., horizontal expansions in mid-rows, tapering at top/bottom); if the test input mirrors training 4 (4 in column 5), expect similar shaped patterns like full horizontals in central rows, not a full column—current output overfills vertically without variation, likely incorrect for the same reasons as training 4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (using numbers like 1 for green, 2 for red, 3 for blue, 4 for yellow, 8 for maroon background), and the output should be a new grid primarily filled with maroon (8), but with red (2) placed in positions that appear to trace, expand, or fill regions influenced by the yellow (4) element's position, possibly interacting with other colors like blue (3) or green (1) to form structured shapes such as lines, blobs, or paths. The goal is to "absorb" or transform non-background elements into red patterns that mimic or extend from the yellow's influence, while ensuring the rest remains maroon.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The yellow (4) element acts as a starting point or "seed" that influences red (2) placement, often along its column, but in complex cases, the red expands horizontally or forms connected shapes (e.g., horizontal bars or diagonal-ish fills) that interact with other input colors like blue (3) or green (1), suggesting rules for propagation, connection, or mirroring.
 * Non-maroon elements (1,3,4) in the input are "removed" or absorbed into the background (set to 8) unless they directly contribute to red filling; however, their positions may guide where red spreads, such as filling entire rows/columns or bounded regions around yellow.
 * Subtle element: Red patterns in expected outputs often form symmetric or expanding blobs (e.g., in train2, rows 4-5 have wide horizontal red fills from columns 8-21, while upper/lower rows have partial verticals at columns 19-20), indicating that yellow's column may trigger vertical fills that widen or connect horizontally based on nearby non-maroon clusters—easy to miss that it's not just a simple column fill.
 * Background is always initialized to maroon (8), and red (2) overrides only specific influenced areas; over-filling (e.g., entire columns without bounds) leads to excess red where expected outputs have isolated or partial fills.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., train2: 23 rows x 25 cols, train3: 23x22, train4/test: 27x27?), so code must handle dynamic h/w; yellow may not always exist or be unique, defaulting to no fill.
 * Other colors: Green (1) and blue (3) seem to define boundaries or extenders for red (e.g., in train3 expected, reds form a central cross-like shape around what might be yellow-influenced areas), but absorbing them to 8 first prevents direct copying—subtlety is that their positions indirectly shape red without preserving their color.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs show "eroded" or simplified versions of input structures, where connected components of non-8 cells near yellow get converted to red blobs, but disconnected ones stay 8; vertical alignment from yellow is core, but horizontal spread varies by row (e.g., wider in "middle" rows).
 * All training examples (except train1) have top/bottom rows fully 8, with red concentrated in mid-grid, suggesting vertical bounding or gradient-like expansion from yellow's row/column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_yellow_position(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Find the row and column index of the yellow element (4); returns (0,0) if not found."""
    for i, row in enumerate(g):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 4:
                return i, j
    return 0, 0
```

```python
def get_non_maroon_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Extract positions of non-maroon elements (1,3,4) to identify potential red-influence zones."""
    positions = []
    for i, row in enumerate(g):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if g[i][j] not in (0, 8):  # Assuming 0 is empty/white, but focus on 1,3,4
                positions.append((i, j))
    return positions
```

```python
def create_background_grid(h: int, w: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Create a grid filled with maroon (8)."""
    return [[8 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly handled train1 by filling the entire yellow column with red (2) on maroon (8) background after absorbing non-maroon to 8, matching a simple vertical line case.
 * Failed train2: Generated a uniform vertical red line in column 10 across all 23 rows, but expected has varied red patterns—e.g., rows 0-2 and 19-22 have partial reds only at columns 19-20, rows 4-5 have full horizontal reds from 8-21, rows 13-14 have shorter horizontals at 8-11, and row 16 has a single red at column 10; difference is lack of horizontal expansion or row-specific bounding, resulting in excess vertical red everywhere instead of clustered blobs.
 * Failed train3: Generated vertical red in column 16 across all 23 rows, but expected has complex central reds—e.g., rows 2-3 have partial at 16-19 and 4-7, rows 4-5 have wide horizontals from 2-21, row 14 has partial at 0-7 and 16, row 15 has full left horizontal 0-7; difference is over-filling the whole column vs. forming cross-like or bounded shapes, ignoring horizontal connections from other non-maroons.
 * Failed train4: Generated vertical red in column 5 across all 27 rows, but expected has mid-grid concentrations—e.g., rows 3-4 partial at 4-7, rows 5-6 full horizontals 2-21, rows 7-8 partial at 3-7, rows 9+ sparse vertical at 5; difference is uniform vertical fill vs. expanding horizontals in central rows, with top/bottom fully 8.
 * Function `remove_non_maroon_elements` is unhelpful/broken: It sets 1,3,4 to 8 on the output grid (which starts as 8 anyway), but doesn't use input positions to guide red placement—essentially does nothing useful beyond init; don't use it, as it ignores propagation rules.
 * Function `fill_red_column` is partially helpful for vertical base but insufficient alone, as it blindly fills entire column without row bounds or horizontal spread.
 * Function `find_yellow_column` is helpful for locating yellow but incomplete—needs row position too, and doesn't account for multi-yellow or interactions.
 * Overall, attempt shows basic understanding of yellow-as-trigger and maroon background, but misses core subtlety of shape formation (e.g., connected components or distance-based fill from yellow), leading to simplistic column-only outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it generates a single uniform vertical red (2) line in column 5 across all 27 rows on maroon (8), similar to failures in train2-4, suggesting the same over-simplification.
 * Based on patterns in incorrect trainings, expected test output likely has more complex red structures: probably horizontal expansions or bounded blobs around column 5 in mid-rows (e.g., wider fills in rows ~5-20, partial verticals elsewhere), with top/bottom rows fully 8 and no full-column red, as uniform verticals mismatched all complex expectations.
 * It fails to account for subtle horizontal propagation or bounding, making the output too sparse/simplistic—e.g., if test input has clustered non-maroons near yellow, reds should form shapes like in train3's cross, but here it's just a line, indicating the program doesn't detect or fill those.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, 4=yellow, 8=maroon) where the goal is to transform the input grid by identifying a key "red column" based on the position of yellow cells (4) relative to initial red bars (2), replacing non-red/non-maroon elements with maroon (8) while preserving or extending reds in a way that fills vertical gaps or connects components in that column, resulting in a output grid that emphasizes extended red structures amid a maroon background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The yellow (4) cell(s) mark the "red column" as the vertical column containing the yellow, which is positioned above or near initial red bars (2); this column needs vertical extension of reds to full height or to fill "holes" (gaps of non-red cells), but not necessarily overwriting everything indiscriminately—initial reds elsewhere must be preserved if they form connected bars or components.
 * Non-red/non-maroon cells (1,3,4) are replaced with maroon (8), but initial reds (2) are preserved globally, not just in the red column; the extension only affects the identified column to resolve vertical discontinuities (e.g., filling gaps between red bars in that column).
 * Subtle element: The puzzle may involve "stacking" or "dropping" reds downward from the yellow's position, connecting multiple horizontal red bars into vertical structures only in the target column, while horizontal reds in other columns remain if they are initial; overlooking this leads to over-extension (full columns of 2s) or loss of multi-column red shapes.
 * Grids have varying widths (e.g., 22-27 columns) and heights (e.g., 23-27 rows), so code must handle dynamic dimensions; assume rectangular grids.
 * Potential for multiple yellows or complex red shapes: Examples show single yellow per case, but expectations have asymmetric red extensions (e.g., partial vertical fills, not full height everywhere).
 * Easy to miss: The transformation resolves "splits" in maroon by filling the red column, but does not create new horizontal reds—only vertical extension in the target column; initial reds outside the column stay as-is after maroon replacement.
 * All cells become 8 except preserved/extended 2s; yellow (4) itself becomes 8 after identifying the column.
 * Considerations across attempts: Finding the yellow column works (as in example 1), but uniform full-height overwrite fails when expectations show partial fills or preserved horizontal bars; need to detect initial red positions in the column and fill only gaps between them, not the entire column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes modular functions, but only `find_red_column` is reliably helpful (correctly identifies the yellow-based column in all cases). The other functions are broken or overly simplistic: `remove_non_maroon_and_red` correctly preserves initial 2s but sets too much to 8 without considering post-extension needs; `extend_red_to_full_height` is unhelpful/broken as it blindly fills the entire column, ignoring gap-filling logic and causing over-extension in examples 2-4 and test.

```python
from typing import List

def find_red_column(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Rule: The red column is the column containing the yellow (4) cell, which is stacked above the initial red bar (2s)."""
    height = len(g)
    width = len(g[0]) if height > 0 else 0
    red_col = -1
    for r in range(height):
        for c in range(width):
            if g[r][c] == 4:
                red_col = c
                break
        if red_col != -1:
            break
    # Verify with 2s if needed, but assume unique 4
    return red_col
```

No other functions from this attempt are helpful; `remove_non_maroon_and_red` and `extend_red_to_full_height` should be revised or replaced (e.g., with a gap-filling function that scans the target column for 2-regions and fills non-2 gaps between min/max row of 2s in that column). No extraction functions for objects (e.g., detecting red bars or components) were provided, but one could be added to identify connected red regions per column for better gap detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program) correctly handled training example 1 by identifying the yellow column and extending it fully, matching the expected simple vertical red fill amid maroon.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated a single full-height column of 2s (column ~10, all rows 2s, rest 8s), but expected preserves multiple horizontal red bars (e.g., rows 4-5 have wide 2s from col 8-21, rows 0-2/6-7/14-23 have partial 2s in cols 19-20 or col 9-10) and only partially fills vertically in the yellow's column (not full height; e.g., gaps remain as 8s in upper/lower parts)—over-extension erased horizontal structures and didn't match asymmetric fills.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated a single full-height column of 2s (column 16, all rows 2s, rest 8s), but expected has multiple horizontal red bars (e.g., rows 4-5/13-14/16-17 have wide 2s across cols 2-20, with vertical connections in cols 4-5 and 16-19) and partial vertical fills only between initial red bars in the target column(s)—ignored multi-column connections and overfilled.
 * Failed training example 4: Generated a single full-height column of 2s (column 5, all rows 2s, rest 8s), but expected preserves horizontal reds (e.g., rows 5-7/21-22 have wide 2s across cols 2-21) and shows partial vertical extension in column 5 (e.g., fills from row 3 downward but not fully, with horizontals intact)—lost initial horizontal reds outside the column.
 * Overall: The column identification via yellow works (core element), but the maroon replacement + full extension logic is broken, as it doesn't preserve or connect initial red bars properly; it treats the target column as uniform fill instead of gap-filling between existing 2s. No object extraction was used, which might help detect red components. Subtleties like partial fills (not full height) and horizontal preservation were missed. The `program` composition is a good structure but needs refined extension logic (e.g., find min/max row with 2s in target column and fill only between them).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows a single full-height column of 2s (column 5, across all ~27 rows, rest 8s), which follows the attempt's flawed full-extension logic but likely mismatches the expected pattern based on training examples—expectations consistently show partial vertical fills (e.g., only between initial red bars) and preserved horizontal reds in other columns, not a uniform column overwrite. Without the test input grid, it's hard to confirm exact mismatches, but this over-simplistic output ignores subtleties like gap-filling only where reds are "stacked" below yellow, potentially erasing complex shapes; it makes sense under the attempt's rules but not the puzzle's, as it would fail similarly to examples 2-4 (e.g., if test has horizontal reds or partial stacks, they'd be lost to 8s except in col 5).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid representation of tree-like structures (trunks and branches) using numbers: likely 1/2 for red elements (solid trunk/branch), 3/4 for green/yellow elements (leafy or branch tips), with the goal of filling valid connected tree components into 2's (solid fill) while setting invalid or unconnected parts to 8's (background/empty), following rules for trunk identification, horizontal/vertical propagation, intersections, and merges without overfilling disconnected or invalid branches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Trunk is a vertical column identified by the lowest 2 or 4; it must be filled solidly from the highest intersection point downward, but not above unless connected via branches.
 * Branches (horizontal spans of 1/3 or 2/4) only fill if they intersect the trunk or are connected via propagation; disconnected branches stay as 8's after final cleanup.
 * Yellow (4) treats as red (2) initially for filling, but original grid (original_g) must be preserved for checks like green-only bridges or top-row extensions.
 * Propagation is vertical (up/down) along connected 1/3 spans triggered by 2's above/below, but must expand horizontally to full connected spans without overextending to disconnected areas.
 * Merging: Multiple 2 spans in a row merge only if bridged by original green (3) in at least one spanning segment that touches the trunk; otherwise, they remain separate or get cleared to 8.
 * Green components (3/4) fill differently: left/top greens skip if no above connection (isolated), but right/top greens may extend upward if filled; avoid filling isolated green blobs.
 * Subtle: Highest intersection is the topmost row with 1/3 in trunk column; stem fill starts there downward. Avoid overpropagation in loops (code uses h iterations, which may be excessive). Final step clears all remaining 1/3 to 8, so only validated 2's survive.
 * Easy to miss: Branches don't fill if they don't touch trunk directly or via propagation; no diagonal connections. Top-row greens on right may extend full height upward only if already filled. In multi-trunk-like setups, only one trunk column is chosen (lowest). Overfilling happens when propagation/merging ignores green-bridge requirements or expands left unnecessarily for non-trunk-touching greens.
 * All attempts must handle varying widths/heights; copy grid to avoid mutating input. Unfilled areas default to 8, but input may have other numbers—assume 0/empty is 8-equivalent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it passed training example 1 (simple trunk/branches correctly filled without overfill), demonstrating core understanding of trunk detection, intersection filling, and stem fill.
 * Failed training 2: Overfilled row 3 (full 0-20 as 2's vs. expected only 9-10 and 19-20), rows 4-5 (extra left 2's at 1- vs. expected starting at 8), row 6 (extra 2-3 2's vs. none), rows 7-12/16-17 (persistent 9-10 2's without vertical connection vs. expected cleared to 8 in most), row 13 (8-11 vs. expected none), row 14 (7-11 vs. 8-? but shifted left), row 15 (8-11 vs. none); rows 0-2 extra 9-10 2's (disconnected, should be 8). Likely due to faulty fill_green_components expanding left unnecessarily and propagate_vertical over-spreading without green checks.
 * Failed training 3: Overfilled row 7 (0-5 2's vs. expected none there, should be 8's), row 8 (16-17 2's vs. 16-17 but wait, expected has 16-17 in row 7? Wait, mismatch in vertical: generated has extra trunk-like 2's in left without connection); row 12 (4-5 vs. expected 4-5 but propagate added extras?); rows 18-22 (16 single 2 vs. expected 16 single, but overfill in row 7 suggests propagation bug); unknown why row 7 left-filled when expected clears it—possibly apply_merge wrongly bridged without green.
 * Failed training 4: Overfilled rows 13-14 (full 0-17 2's vs. expected none in row 13, only trunk in 14? Wait, expected row 13 none, row 14 14-15 2's? No, expected has sparse; generated added extra horizontal in 13 from bad merge/propagate); rows 5-7 (extra right 2's in 13-21 vs. expected full but only if connected—overfill in row 5 13-21 when expected stops at 21? Lists show generated misses full row 5-6 connection); unknown blob shape mismatch in lower right (generated sparse 14 2's vs. expected full horizontal in some).
 * fill_green_components is buggy/not helpful: Skips left/top greens correctly but wrongly expands left to 0 for non-trunk greens, causing overfill (e.g., train 2 row 3 full); remove or fix skip logic for isolated greens.
 * propagate_vertical is somewhat helpful but over-iterates (h times may loop too much, spreading to disconnected); unhelpful as-is due to no boundary on expansion—add checks for trunk proximity.
 * apply_merge is broken: Merges spans if any has green bridge touching trunk, but applies globally per row without verifying all spans connect, leading to over-merges (e.g., train 2 row 3 full merge); not helpful without stricter per-span validation.
 * extend_top_green_right is unhelpful/broken: Only extends upward if already filled and top-row green on right, but condition grid[r][c]==2 triggers wrongly on non-top, causing vertical overfill (e.g., train 3 row 7); ignore or rewrite for true top-only (r==0).
 * Overall, core trunk/intersect/stem work (passed train 1), but green handling, propagation, and merging fail on disconnected/multi-branch cases, leaving extra 2's instead of 8's.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills several areas similar to training failures, e.g., row 3 full 0-15 2's (likely bad green expand/merge, should be sparser branches only touching trunk at ~16), rows 4-7 extra left 2's (1- vs. expected starting later, disconnected), row 12 full 0-15 2's (over-propagate from above without connection), row 14-15 extra right 16-21 2's (should be limited to trunk-touching spans), lower rows 18-26 single 5 2's (trunk?) but sparse without horizontal branches vs. expected fuller if connected—mismatches suggest same bugs as train 2/3 (over-expansion left/right without green bridges or top checks). It partially captures trunk at col 5 and right branches at 16-17, but extras make it invalid; account for multi-level branches and stricter connectivity to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle (likely a variant of a connection or region-filling puzzle like a tree-drawing or path-completion challenge) where the input grid contains clues (numbers like 1 for interior points, 3 for edge/endpoint markers, 4 for a starting stem point, 2 for pre-filled paths, and 8 for barriers or empty space), and the goal is to output a new grid filling connected regions or paths with 2s based on rules for stems, gaps, flooding, and edge extensions, while leaving unfilled areas as 8s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes connectivity: filled areas (2s) must connect clues like 1s (which seem to require enclosure or path inclusion) and 3s (which act as borders or endpoints that trigger gap-filling or extensions), but only through non-8 cells; 8s act as hard barriers that split groups.
 * Stem filling starts from a unique column containing a 4 (likely a root or base clue) and fills downward or in a primary block from the top, but only in that column initially; subtle: if multiple non-8 blocks exist in the stem column, it prioritizes the topmost block's start row, which could miss multi-block stems if not handled.
 * Gap filling (horizontal or vertical) only occurs between adjacent groups of non-8 cells if both groups contain at least one 1, and at least one bordering cell (the end of the upper/left group or start of the lower/right group) is a 3; this bridges separated regions but skips if no 1s or no 3 border, preventing over-filling isolated clues.
 * Flood fill propagates from any initial 2s (including stems, pre-filled 2s/4s, and gaps) into adjacent (4-directional) cells that are 1 or 3, marking them as 2s; key subtlety: it does not fill into 8s, 2s (already filled), or other numbers, and uses BFS to ensure full connectivity without revisiting; this can expand regions but risks over-filling if initial seeds are wrong.
 * Edge extensions (horizontal or vertical) only apply to the first/last group in a row/column if it starts/ends with a 3, contains a 1, and has any 2s already; it then fills outward to the grid edge; subtle: this handles "open-ended" paths but requires prior filling (from flood or gaps) to trigger, and only for groups with 1s, avoiding extension of empty or clue-less edges.
 * Pre-filled handling: Any input 2 or 4 must be copied as 2s in output, serving as seeds; 1 and 3 are fillable but not initial seeds unless connected.
 * Overall process order matters: stem first, then copy seeds, then gaps (which may create new seeds), then flood (expands everything), then extensions (which rely on prior filling); running in wrong order could miss propagations.
 * Subtle elements easy to miss: Groups are defined by consecutive non-8 cells, ignoring isolated 8s; no filling into or across full 8 barriers; 4 is only for stem location, not general filling; potential for multiple iterations if gaps/extensions create new opportunities, but current code does single passes; handles empty grid edge case; assumes rectangular grid with uniform width.
 * Considerations across attempts: No diagonal connections (only 4 dirs); no looping or enclosure checks (pure connectivity); 1s seem mandatory to include (via flood/gaps), but 3s are optional unless bordering; potential for disconnected components if no connecting 3 or shared 1s.

(Note: Functions like fill_horizontal_gaps, fill_vertical_gaps, extend_horizontal_edges, and extend_vertical_edges are helpful extensions of the group-extraction logic above, applying conditional filling based on 1s and 3s; they are not broken but depend on get_groups_* working correctly. The main program orchestrates them in sequence, which is useful for the overall pipeline.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but the gap-filling functions (fill_horizontal_gaps/fill_vertical_gaps) could be unhelpful if they over-fill without checking for prior flood results, as they run before flood—might need iteration. No extraction functions for full "objects" (e.g., bounding boxes of connected 1/3 regions) were included, which could be added for better group analysis but isn't essential yet.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handled all 4 training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of stem filling, gap bridging with 1+3 conditions, flood propagation into 1/3, and edge extensions from 3s.
 * What worked: Stem correctly identifies and fills from 4's column (e.g., vertical line of 2s); gaps properly bridge only qualifying segments (with 1s and 3 borders); flood ensures connected 1/3 inclusion without crossing 8s; extensions handle open 3-ends post-filling; order of operations allows propagation (gaps seed flood, flood seeds extensions).
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the output fills a vertical stem in column 5 (indices 0-based, starting ~row 4 downward, matching a likely 4 position), copies presumed input 2/4 as 2s, creates horizontal "arms" (e.g., rows 3-4 cols 2-6, row 5 cols 1-8), a mid-blob (rows 5-7 cols 1-20ish with breaks), and vertical fills (e.g., col 16-17 partial), but leaves large areas (e.g., bottom rows 17-26 only stem 2s in col 5, no extensions) as 8s; this may miss deeper connections if input has isolated 1/3 groups not bridged by gaps or if extensions don't trigger due to no prior 2s in edge groups—unknown if input has such cases, but output seems under-filled compared to a full "tree" expectation (e.g., no full horizontal spans in lower rows despite potential 3 borders).
 * Subtleties missed potentially: Single-pass gaps/flood may not handle chained propagations (e.g., a gap creating a 2 that enables another gap); stem assumes top-block priority, which works for training but could fail if test stem is mid-grid without top connection; no validation that all 1s are filled (output has 8s near potential 1s? unknown without input grid).
 * Group extraction (get_groups_*) is essential for gaps/extensions and worked well in training; flood_fill is core and correctly limited to 1/3.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt shows partial understanding—training passed due to simple connected clues, but test may reveal gaps in handling sparse or multi-level connections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (27x27 grid) makes partial sense: It correctly forms a central vertical stem of 2s in column 5 (from ~row 4 to bottom), with horizontal extensions in upper-mid rows (e.g., row 3: cols 3-6; row 4: cols 2-7+16-17; row 5: cols 1-9+16-19), a filled blob in rows 5-7 cols 1-9 and partial in 16-19, and thinner verticals in cols 16-17 rows 0-10ish; this looks like a tree-like structure with branches, aligning with stem+gaps+flood rules if the input has a 4 in col 5, 1s in branch groups, and 3s at edges.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower rows (17-26) are only the stem 2 in col 5 with all else 8s, suggesting missed vertical gaps or extensions (e.g., if input has 1s+3s below, they should bridge/flood but didn't—possibly no connecting 3 borders or isolated groups); upper rows (0-2) have minimal 2s (only partial in cols 16-17), potentially under-filling if input has connectable 1/3 there; no full grid-spanning fills, and many 8-regions persist, which might leave 1s unfilled (unknown without input, but differs from expectation of comprehensive connectivity if puzzle requires all 1s included); overall, under-filled compared to training successes, likely missing iterative propagation or broader gap conditions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic puzzle similar to a nonogram or region-filling grid (e.g., Nurikabe or a custom deduction puzzle), where the input grid contains clues (1 for interior/object cells, 3 for borders/edges, 4 for special stem markers, 2 for pre-filled regions, and 8 for unknown/empty cells), and the goal is to deduce and fill unknown cells (8s) with 2s to complete connected regions or objects while respecting separation by empties and border rules. The program iteratively applies deduction rules to propagate fillings from clues and pre-fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions or "objects" are defined as contiguous groups of non-8 cells (clues 1,2,3,4), separated by 8s; these groups must be analyzed horizontally and vertically for connections, gaps, and extensions.
 * Gaps between adjacent groups can be filled with 2s only if both groups contain at least one 1 (interior clue) and at least one bordering group ends with a 3 (border clue), indicating a continuous region across the gap.
 * Flood fill propagates 2s from known 2s into adjacent 8s only if the target cell's clue is 1 or 3 (part of an object), but not into pure empties or other clues; this must be careful to avoid overfilling disconnected areas.
 * Special handling for "stem" columns identified by 4s: these seem to indicate a vertical backbone that should be filled starting from the top of the first non-8 block downward, potentially spanning the entire height if it's a single continuous block.
 * Extensions from borders: If a group has a 3 at its edge (left/right for horizontal, top/bottom for vertical) and contains both a 1 and a known 2, extend filling into adjacent 8s beyond the border in that direction, simulating region growth.
 * Iteration is key: Rules must be applied in a loop until no changes occur, as propagations can chain (e.g., gap fill enables flood fill, which enables extension).
 * Pre-filled 2s and 4s are copied directly and treated as known; 4s are not propagated as 2s but used only for stem detection.
 * Subtlety: Groups are strictly contiguous non-8 sequences; single-cell groups or isolated 1/3s may not trigger fills without adjacent 2s or borders. Avoid filling into areas without any 1/3 support, as 8s outside objects should remain 8 (empties).
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns (all 8s) skip processing; stems with multiple disconnected blocks start filling from the topmost block but only downward; no diagonal connections (only orthogonal).
 * Potential misses: Over-reliance on borders (3s) without confirming object presence (1s); incomplete flood fill that doesn't revisit after initial queue; failure to handle stems that don't span full height or have gaps.

(Note: Other functions like fill_horizontal_gaps, fill_vertical_gaps, extend_horizontal, extend_vertical, and the stem-filling logic in program() are also helpful and build on these, but the group extraction and flood fill are core building blocks. The overall program() wrapper with iteration loop is essential for chaining rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly identifying stems via 4s, filling gaps between clue groups with 1s and 3-borders, propagating via flood fill into 1/3 areas, and extending from borders when groups had mixed 1s and 2s.
 * Worked well for cases with single continuous stems and horizontal/vertical propagations, as evidenced by 100% training accuracy.
 * Stem detection and downward filling from the topmost non-8 block in the 4-column is a key insight that likely succeeded in training.
 * Gap-filling logic correctly requires both adjacent groups to have 1s and at least one 3-border, preventing invalid connections.
 * Iterative loop ensures changes propagate fully, which was crucial for training cases with chained deductions.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., get_groups_row/col, flood_fill) are relevant and functional, though the stem block-merging logic assumes single-block stems for full-height fill, which might be a subtlety.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills a vertical stem in column 5 (index 5, 0-based) with 2s starting from row 1 downward across all 27 rows, which aligns with stem rules if a 4 was present there and it formed a single block.
 * Horizontal fills create a rough "tree-like" or "structure" shape: e.g., row 3 has 2s in cols 3-6, row 4 extends to cols 2-7, row 5 to cols 1-8, rows 6-7 fill cols 1-19 partially, row 8 mirrors row 5, etc., and a vertical band in cols 16-18 with 2s in most rows, suggesting gap-fills and extensions worked for a central object.
 * However, the output does not look fully correct or complete: ~70-80% of the grid remains 8s (e.g., entire right side cols 20-26 are all 8s except sparse 2s, top rows 0-2 have minimal fills, bottom rows 18-26 have only stem 2s), indicating potential misses in flood fill propagation, vertical extensions, or gap fills for disconnected or edge objects.
 * Specific differences: Rows 0-2 have only sparse 2s in cols 16-17, but if the input has 1/3 clues there, flood fill should have expanded more; row 14 has 2s in cols 14-18 but not extended left/right despite apparent group patterns; no fills in cols 0-0 or 19+ suggest missed horizontal extensions from 3-borders or incomplete iteration.
 * The output makes partial sense for a sparse puzzle with a tall stem and one main object, but it seems under-filled compared to what iterative rules should achieve if the input has multiple 1/3 groups—likely missing chained vertical gap fills or flood into upper/lower extensions, leaving isolated 8s within clue areas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving filling connected regions (likely representing solid objects like shapes or organic forms such as trees/mushrooms) based on partial outlines and structural elements, where numbers like 1 (interior points), 3 (boundaries/edges), 4 (stem starters), 2 (pre-filled or to-fill solid), and 8 (empty/background) guide the filling process to complete coherent blobs without overfilling isolated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Identify a "stem" column via a 4 marker and fill downward from the top (or the first non-8 block) with 2s, treating it as a vertical anchor that connects to overhead structures.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical): Between groups of non-8 cells separated by 8s, fill gaps with 2s only if an adjacent 3 (edge) borders the gap and the group contains at least one 1 (interior), ensuring fills bridge logical continuations without arbitrary extensions.
 * Flood fill: Propagate 2s into adjacent (4-directional) 1s and 3s that are unvisited, but only after initial placements; this connects interiors and boundaries but skips 8s and already-filled areas to avoid spilling into voids.
 * Edge extensions: For boundary groups (left/right for rows, top/bottom for columns), extend fills outward only if the edge cell is a 3, the group has a 1, and some part is already filled with 2—prevents over-extension into infinite empties but allows completing open-ended shapes.
 * Subtleties: 8s act as hard barriers, so groups are segmented by them; original 2s and 4s are preserved/treated as seeds; fills must respect object cohesion (e.g., no filling across unrelated 8-separated regions); potential for multiple blobs, but stem prioritizes vertical continuity; easy to miss that extensions require both a 3 at the edge AND a 1 inside, avoiding false positives on empty outlines.
 * Considerations: Order matters—stem first, then copy originals, gaps, flood, extensions—to build from structure outward; handles irregular shapes but may fail on diagonal connections (code uses only orthogonal); assumes single stem (returns -1 if none, but fills nothing extra); 1s confirm "fillable" interiors, 3s suggest permeable boundaries.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but the code builds a complete pipeline from stem detection to final extensions.
 * Successfully handled all 4 training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating strong grasp of core filling mechanics for standard cases like connected outlines with stems.
 * What worked: Stem filling anchors vertical structures correctly; gap filling bridges 8-separated groups conditionally; flood fill connects 1/3 regions orthogonally; extensions complete open edges without overreach.
 * What didn't work/missed: No explicit handling for multiple stems or non-stem objects (assumes single 4-column); potential oversight in diagonal connections (flood fill is orthogonal-only, which may fragment diagonal blobs); edge extensions check for filled parts but might not trigger if flood fill misses seeds; no validation for overfilling (e.g., if 3s form loops without 1s).
 * get_groups_row and get_col_groups are essential for segmenting inputs into fillable units.
 * fill_horizontal_gaps and fill_vertical_gaps correctly condition on 3+1 presence but could be unhelpful if gaps are diagonal (not addressed).
 * extend_edges is helpful for boundary completion but may be broken for cases where the "highest/lowest" group isn't the absolute edge due to leading 8s.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem relevant, though flood_fill's orthogonal limitation might need 8-directional dirs for some puzzles.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output depicts a 27x27 grid (rows listed as 1D arrays) with a prominent vertical "stem" of 2s in columns 16-17 from row 0 downward (full height, double-thick at top), suggesting correct stem filling from a 4 marker.
 * A large irregular blob of 2s on the left (rows 3-9, columns 2-8 and extending rightward variably) resembles foliage or a crown, connected via flood/gaps, with a smaller vertical extension in column 5 from row 4 to bottom (thin trunk-like).
 * Bottom half (rows 13+) shows only the main stem filled (single or double 2s in col 16-17), with isolated 2s in col 5, and all else 8s—no horizontal branching or fills, which makes sense if input has no 1/3 clues there.
 * Overall, the output looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., no fills in pure 8 areas, connections via 1/3 implied), forming a tree-like shape; it makes sense as correct if the test input has a stemmed object with left-side canopy and a separate thin vertical element, but without input grid, can't confirm if flood missed any 1/3 regions or if extensions over/under-filled boundaries—appears visually plausible and not obviously wrong (e.g., no stray 2s in voids).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle solver where the goal is to fill in a output grid (using 2 for filled cells) based on input clues: 1 (likely internal elements like dots or leaves), 2 (pre-filled), 3 (borders or edges), 4 (stem starters), and 8 (empty/unknown). The solver connects and extends these into coherent shapes, such as stems, branches, or objects, by filling gaps, flooding adjacent areas, and extending from borders, likely representing organic structures like plants or trees in a logic puzzle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify and fully fill vertical "stem" columns starting from any 4 clue, extending downward (or fully if isolated), but only in non-8 areas of the input—subtlety: stems may not span the entire height if blocked by 8's, and blocks of non-8 rows need grouping to determine fill range.
 * Horizontal and vertical gap filling between groups of non-8 cells only if both sides contain at least one 1 (indicating content) and at least one side has a 3 border—easy to miss: gaps must be strictly separated (no overlap), and filling only occurs in 8's without overwriting existing non-8's.
 * Flood fill from any 2 into orthogonally adjacent 1 or 3 cells that are still 8, but not into 8-only areas or other numbers—subtlety: this is iterative and can propagate changes, but must respect input boundaries (no filling pure 8 regions).
 * Edge extension from 3 borders outward (up/down for vertical, left/right for horizontal) only if the group has both 1 (content) and 2 (already filled)—key miss: extensions stop at grid edges or existing non-8's, and only apply to the outermost groups per row/column.
 * Iteration is crucial: all filling steps (gaps, flood, extensions) run in a loop until no changes, as each can enable the next (e.g., gap fill enables flood).
 * Input groups (rows/columns) ignore 8's as separators, treating consecutive non-8's as blocks—subtlety: empty rows/columns (all 8's) skip processing.
 * No overwriting of input non-8 cells; output starts as copy of 2/4 to 2, rest 8.
 * Potential for multiple components: solver handles per-row/column independently but flood connects across.
 * Subtle edge case: if no stem (no 4), no special stem fill, but other rules still apply.
 * Over-extension risk: extensions only if both 1 and 2 present, preventing filling empty bordered areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; no prior iterations to compare directly.
 * Stem filling works well: correctly identifies and fills vertical columns from 4, grouping non-8 blocks appropriately.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical) succeeds in training examples by bridging separated groups with 1's and 3's, but may underfill if iterations don't propagate fully (e.g., new 2's from one step enabling later gaps).
 * Flood fill is effective for connecting adjacent 1/3 areas but only after initial fills; subtlety missed in isolation: it doesn't fill pure 8 gaps without a 1/3 anchor.
 * Edge extensions handle outward growth from 3's correctly in training, but could overextend if 1/2 checks are too loose (though not observed here).
 * Overall loop iterates all steps until stable, which is key and worked for all training examples (all CORRECT).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_stem, fill_stem, get_groups, fill_gaps, flood_fill, extend_edges) are relevant and build toward shape completion.
 * extract_objects not present or needed; no object extraction attempted, as puzzle seems rule-based filling rather than high-level parsing.

**Test output:**
 * The test output forms a coherent vertical stem in column 5 (0-indexed) with 2's from roughly row 4 to row 25, plus horizontal branches (e.g., row 4: 2's cols 1-7; row 5: 2's cols 1-9 and 15-19; similar patterns upward to row 2), tapering off at the bottom with isolated 2's in rows 17-25 col 5 only—looks like a tree trunk with upper branches, leaving lower grid as 8's.
 * This makes sense for a puzzle with a central stem (likely a 4 in input col 5) and horizontal clues (1's and 3's) in upper rows forming branches; flood and gap fills connected them without overfilling the bottom (possibly no 1/3 clues there).
 * No obvious errors: no stray 2's in empty areas, extensions seem bounded, and structure matches organic puzzle expectations (e.g., no full-grid fill).
 * Minor concern: rows 0-1 have partial 2's only in cols 16-17 (possibly a small branch or stem extension), which might be correct if input has isolated 1/3 there, but could indicate underfilling if a larger connection was expected—unknown without input grid, but consistent with rules.
 * Overall, test output looks correct and demonstrates understanding, as it avoids common pitfalls like filling all 8's or ignoring stems.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Interactions

Based on analysis of all four train inputs and their corresponding outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train example (no exceptions) and demonstrate clear, direct interaction or effect (e.g., positional adjacency, transformation consistency, or property linkage). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., variable numbers/positions of Greens or Blues, variable output shapes for Red or Maroon splits) are excluded. Unknown or non-obvious transformations (e.g., how Greens/Blues specifically affect Maroon splitting or Red expansion) are noted as such rather than speculated upon.

1. **Yellow and Red positional adjacency and vertical stacking**:
   - In every input, the Yellow element (always 1 pixel, holes=0) is positioned directly above the top of the Red element (a thin vertical rectangle/bar, holes=0, 2-3 pixels tall).
   - The Red's bbox starts immediately below the Yellow's y-coordinate (no gap), sharing the same x-coordinate, creating a consistent "stacked" connection where Yellow sits atop Red.
   - This stack is preserved in outputs as the basis for Red's transformation (Red always expands from this position, but exact expansion rules are unknown and inconsistent in direction/scale).

2. **Red transformation from input stack to output vertical/horizontal expansion**:
   - In every input, Red originates as a small vertical bar (holes=0, pixels=2-3) directly below Yellow.
   - In every output, this Red expands significantly in size (pixels=13-111) while retaining holes=0, always starting from or near the input stack's position (x/y coordinates of the original Red/Yellow). It affects adjacent space by overwriting or dividing other elements (e.g., interacting with Maroon regions).
   - Expansion consistently fills toward the canvas edges or between other components, but the precise trigger/mechanism (e.g., influenced by Greens/Blues) is unknown and varies.

3. **Maroon background property change (holes) due to other elements**:
   - In every input, Maroon is a single large element (bbox covering full canvas [0,0,width,height], pixels=175-625) with holes>0 (1-4 holes), indicating interactions with overlaid elements (e.g., Greens/Blues/Yellow/Red "punching" or occupying space within it).
   - In every output, all Maroon instances have holes=0, showing a consistent "filling" or repair effect triggered by the overall transformation (likely interacting with Red expansion and possibly Greens/Blues positions, but exact cause unknown).
   - Maroon consistently splits into 1-2 instances in outputs, with bboxes adjusted to avoid overlap with expanded Red, but split patterns vary.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., direct Green-Blue connections, color-based movement, or hole count effects on specific shapes) are evident across all examples, as positions and effects vary without uniform linkage. Elements like Greens (always small, holes=0, pixels=1-2) and Blues (larger rectangles, holes=0, pixels=7-50) appear in every input but lack a consistent, direct interaction with each other or fixed effects on outputs beyond potential unknown influence on Maroon/Red. The pixelated/blocky rendering is uniform but does not interact with other properties.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:45:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where cells contain clues (1 for internal points, 3 for borders/edges, 4 for stem anchors, 2 for pre-filled stems/connections, and 8 for empty space), and the goal is to propagate and fill additional stem/connections (with 2's) based on rules for vertical stems, horizontal/vertical gap filling between groups, flood-filling connected areas, and extending edges from borders, ultimately completing object outlines or linkages without overfilling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Vertical stems (from 4) should fill downward from the lowest non-8 row in the column, but only if there's a single block of non-8's or starting from the topmost block; multiple disconnected blocks require starting from the absolute top (row 0) to avoid partial fills.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical) only triggers between adjacent non-8 groups if both groups contain at least one 1 (internal clue), and at least one bordering cell is 3 (edge clue); this ensures connections are justified by internal structure, not just proximity, and only fills 8's in the gap.
 * Flood-fill propagates 2's only into adjacent 8's that overlie 1 or 3 in the input grid, treating 2's as seeds for connected components but respecting the underlying clues to avoid filling arbitrary empties.
 * Edge extension (horizontal/vertical) applies only to the outermost groups in rows/columns: if the edge cell is 3 and the group has a 1 and already some 2's, extend filling into leading/trailing 8's across the entire row/column prefix/suffix, simulating full boundary completion.
 * Iteration is key: all filling steps (gaps, flood, edges) must loop until no changes, as propagations can chain (e.g., a new 2 from gaps enables flood-fill).
 * Subtlety: Pre-fill all existing 2's and 4's as 2's in output; ignore 8's in input for grouping but use them as barriers; do not fill over non-8 clues or outside grid.
 * Easy to miss: Stem column detection scans entire grid for any 4 (assumes single stem); groups skip 8's entirely, treating them as separators; flood-fill uses BFS but only on 8's overlying 1/3, not pure 8's; extensions can fill entire empty prefixes/suffixes if conditions met, potentially creating long arms.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no stem (stem_col=-1 skips fill_stem); ensure changed flags accumulate across steps to control loop; avoid filling if no 1 in group (prevents spurious connections); vertical/horizontal symmetry in gap/edge functions, but stem is vertical-only; potential overfill if flood escapes via 3's without bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples, correctly filling stems, gaps, floods, and edges to complete the expected outputs.
 * Stem filling worked well for single-block cases but may underfill in multi-block scenarios if start_row logic doesn't always default to 0 (code sets to min(blocks[0]) for multiple, which could skip upper empties if top block isn't at 0).
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical) correctly conditioned on 1's and bordering 3's, enabling connections in training but potentially missing chained propagations if iteration order matters.
 * Flood-fill and edge extensions propagated correctly in training, demonstrating understanding of connected components and boundary completion.
 * Overall loop with changed flags ensured convergence without infinite loops.
 * No major misses in training, but subtle edge cases like no-stem grids or fully empty rows/columns were implicitly handled by skipping.
 * Functions like find_column, get_row_groups, get_col_groups are essential and correct for grouping; fill_stem is helpful but its block logic may need review for starting row in multi-block stems.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant; extend_horizontal_edges and extend_vertical_edges are key for boundary filling but could overextend if 2's are pre-present without 1's (though code checks has1).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 27x27 grid mostly filled with 8's (empties), with 2's forming a large irregular blob/structure in the upper-left (rows 3-9, cols 2-8+), a vertical stem-like line in col 5 from row 10 downward to bottom, scattered horizontal fills in rows 4-5 and 14-16 around cols 16-19, and minimal other 2's (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 16-17).
 * This appears partially correct: the upper blob looks like a connected object fill via flood/gaps/edges, and the long vertical 2's in col 5 suggest proper stem filling from a 4 anchor, extending downward; horizontal extensions in mid-right seem to bridge small groups.
 * However, it does not look fully correct—large empty areas (e.g., bottom-right, most of cols 0-4 below row 9, and entire rows 18-26 except col 5) remain 8's, which may indicate missed vertical extensions or gap fills if the input has underlying 1/3's there; for example, if test input has disconnected lower objects with 3 borders and 1's, gaps or edges should propagate more 2's, but output leaves them isolated.
 * Subtle differences: The output has abrupt cutoffs (e.g., row 9 ends blob sharply, row 17 has isolated 2's in cols 16-19 without vertical ties), suggesting flood-fill didn't chain fully or stem didn't extend horizontally; expected output likely has more interconnected 2's forming complete object linkages, but this seems underfilled in lower sections for unknown reasons (possibly input lacks sufficient 1/3 triggers or grouping skips key areas).
 * The right-side vertical pairs (e.g., cols 16-17 in upper rows) look like partial edge extensions, but inconsistent downward propagation hints at broken vertical gap logic for sparse columns.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 03:47:00] Response:
### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs (1-4), the following are the only consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships between elements (e.g., positional adjacency, structural embedding) that appear without variation. No high-level interpretations or puzzle-solving inferences are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., varying hole counts in Maroon, exact pixel totals, or canvas dimensions) are excluded. Transformations from input to output are noted only where directly observable and consistent; unexplained aspects are flagged as unknown.

#### 1. **Yellow and Red (Positional Connection)**
   - **Description**: The Yellow element (always a single pixel, holes=0, pixels=1) consistently determines the starting position for the Red element. Red (holes=0, pixels=2-3) is placed as a vertical extension directly below Yellow.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (bbox): Red's x-coordinates match Yellow's x exactly (e.g., both centered at x=8 in Train 1, x=10 in Train 2). Red's y starts immediately adjacent below Yellow's y (e.g., Yellow y=9 → Red y=10 in Train 1; Yellow y=20 → Red y=21 in Train 2).
     - Shape/Structure: Red forms a thin vertical line (width=1 in bbox) extending from Yellow's position to the canvas bottom edge.
   - **Consistency**: Present and identical in structure across all train inputs. No other colors or elements influence this pairing.
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional dependency (Yellow position → Red position and extension).

#### 2. **Green and Blue (Positional Adjacency)**
   - **Description**: Every Green element (holes=0, pixels=1-2) is consistently positioned adjacent to or directly overlapping with at least one Blue element. Greens act as small accents relative to Blues.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (bbox): Green's bbox either overlaps or shares an edge with a Blue's bbox in x and/or y coordinates (e.g., vertical adjacency in Train 1: Green y=1 adjacent to Blue y=2-5; horizontal adjacency in Train 4: Green x=7 adjacent to Blue x=2-6). No Green exists in isolation.
     - Shape/Structure: Blues (holes=0, pixels=7-22) are blocky or rectangular; Greens are smaller (pixelated dots or lines) and align along Blue edges or interiors without altering Blue holes.
   - **Consistency**: Every Green has this adjacency to a Blue in all train inputs (multiple Greens per input, each paired). No exceptions or unpaired Greens.
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional alignment (Green position → Blue structure as accent).

#### 3. **Blue/Green and Maroon (Spatial Embedding)**
   - **Description**: All Blue and Green elements are consistently embedded within the Maroon's bounding box, contributing to Maroon's structure without independent positioning outside it.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (bbox): Blues and Greens occupy subspaces inside Maroon's full-canvas bbox (e.g., Maroon [0,0,14,12] contains Blue [1,2,4,5] and Green [2,1,3,1] in Train 1; similarly in all others). Yellow/Red may align near Maroon's lower edge but do not embed.
     - Shape/Structure: Maroon (holes>0 in input, pixels=175-518) surrounds Blues/Greens, with holes present (count varies: 1-4). Blues/Greens have no holes themselves but are non-Maroon pixels within Maroon's area.
   - **Consistency**: All Blues and Greens are internal to Maroon's bbox across every train input. Maroon always covers the entire canvas extent.
   - **Interaction Type**: Spatial containment (Blue/Green positions → Maroon as enclosing background with holes).

#### Notes on Transformations (Input to Output)
- **Consistent Changes**:
  - Blues, Greens, and Yellow are absent in all outputs (no trace in color, position, or pixels).
  - Red persists but changes from vertical line (pixels=2-3) to wider/spanning form (pixels=13-111, bbox expands horizontally or fills area).
  - Maroon holes reduce to 0 in all outputs; Maroon may split into multiple instances (2-3 per output) with adjusted bboxes and pixels (e.g., total Maroon pixels decrease: 175→182 in Train 1, but split).
- **Unknown Aspects**: The exact mechanism for Red's expansion (e.g., why horizontal in some outputs) or Maroon's splitting/filling (e.g., relation to input hole count or Blue positions) is not directly observable or consistent in a explainable way beyond the above input connections. Pixelated details or circular forms mentioned in the query are not evident in the output data (outputs show only Maroon/Red blocks). No further interactions can be identified without forcing inconsistencies.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:47:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid containing markers like 4 (possibly indicating a starting point or key element) and transforming it into a new grid filled with 8s except for specific patterns of 2s that highlight or trace structures, paths, or shapes based on the positions and relationships of elements in the input grid. The current program oversimplifies this by only identifying the first 4 and filling its entire column with 2s, which works for simple vertical cases but fails to capture more complex, non-uniform patterns like diagonals, horizontals, or blob-like shapes seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid likely contains multiple 4s or other elements (e.g., implied by patterns in expects), and the output 2s form connected or symmetric shapes (e.g., lines, diamonds, or filled regions) rather than full columns or rows—e.g., in training 2, 2s appear in tapering diagonals and horizontal bands, not a single vertical line.
 * Subtlety: The position of the first 4 determines a starting column, but subsequent 2s propagate in multiple directions (horizontal, diagonal) or fill regions based on proximity or symmetry, as seen in training 3 and 4 where 2s form mirrored or expanding patterns around certain rows/columns.
 * Key consideration: Outputs preserve the grid dimensions and fill everything else with 8s, but 2s are not uniform—e.g., in training 2, upper rows have 2s only in positions 19-20, mid-rows expand to full horizontal bands of 2s from column 8, and lower rows taper back; this suggests rules involving distance from the 4, row-specific expansions, or object detection like "blobs" of connected cells.
 * Easy to miss: No full-column fills in complex cases; instead, 2s are sparse or patterned (e.g., training 3 has isolated pairs of 2s in columns 4-5 and 16-17, expanding to full rows in mid-sections); the program ignores row variations and multiple potential starting points.
 * Across attempts: Only vertical propagation is handled, missing horizontal/diagonal spreads; grid may have implicit "objects" (connected 4s or other values) that need extraction before patterning; ensure iteration stops at first 4 only if it's a unique trigger, but expects suggest processing all or contextual elements.
 * Considerations for test: Without input grid, assume similar to training 4 (vertical trigger in column 5); if input has a single 4 in column 5, full-column 2s might work, but patterns in other trainings imply it should expand horizontally or form shapes, not a uniform column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    new_g = [[8] * w for _ in range(h)]
    c = -1
    for idx in range(h * w):
        r = idx // w
        s = idx % w
        if g[r][s] == 4:
            c = s
            break
    if c != -1:
        for r in range(h):
            new_g[r][c] = 2
    return new_g
```
(This is the core function from the attempt; it's helpful for basic grid initialization and finding the first 4's column, but broken for non-vertical patterns—extend it with row-wise or diagonal filling logic.)

No other specialized functions (e.g., for object extraction) were provided; a potential future helper could be a function to find all 4 positions and compute distances or connections:
```python
def find_all_markers(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple[int, int]]:
    markers = []
    for r in range(len(g)):
        for s in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[r][s] == 4:
                markers.append((r, s))
    return markers
```
(This would be helpful to detect multiple 4s if present, as single-4 assumption fails in complex expects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles training 1, likely a simple case where the single 4 triggers a full vertical column of 2s matching the expected output.
 * Failed training 2: Generated uniform column 10 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has varied patterns—e.g., rows 0-2 have 2s only at indices 19-20, row 3 at 9-10 and 19-20, rows 4-5 full horizontal 2s from index 8 to 21, then tapering; difference is lack of horizontal/diagonal expansion and row-specific widths (unknown why, possibly distance-based filling from 4).
 * Failed training 3: Generated full column 16 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected starts with all-8s rows 0-2, then pairs of 2s (e.g., row 2: indices 4-5 and 16-17), expands to full rows of 2s in mid-section (rows 4-5: indices 2-20), and tapers with isolated 2s; difference is over-filling the entire column instead of patterned, symmetric spreads around multiple points.
 * Failed training 4: Generated full column 5 of 2s across all 23 rows, but expected has all-8s in upper rows 0-2, then horizontal expansions (e.g., row 3: indices 4-5 as 2s, row 5: full row of 2s from 2-21, rows 6-7 same), tapering to single 2s in column 5 lower down; difference is ignoring horizontal fills and row variations, treating it as pure vertical.
 * The linear scan for first 4 works for simple cases but misses multi-4 or contextual rules; no object extraction attempted, which might be needed for "blobs" or connected components.
 * Function for grid init and column fill is partially helpful but not for the puzzle—extend to pattern generation; no unhelpful/broken functions beyond this oversimplification.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a uniform column 5 (index 5) of 2s across all 27 rows, with rest 8s, similar to training 4's generated but extended to a taller grid.
 * This does not look correct based on patterns in trainings 2-4, where even vertical triggers lead to non-uniform outputs (e.g., horizontal expansions in mid-rows, tapering at top/bottom); if the test input mirrors training 4 (4 in column 5), expect similar shaped patterns like full horizontals in central rows, not a full column—current output overfills vertically without variation, likely incorrect for the same reasons as training 4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (using numbers like 1 for green, 2 for red, 3 for blue, 4 for yellow, 8 for maroon background), and the output should be a new grid primarily filled with maroon (8), but with red (2) placed in positions that appear to trace, expand, or fill regions influenced by the yellow (4) element's position, possibly interacting with other colors like blue (3) or green (1) to form structured shapes such as lines, blobs, or paths. The goal is to "absorb" or transform non-background elements into red patterns that mimic or extend from the yellow's influence, while ensuring the rest remains maroon.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The yellow (4) element acts as a starting point or "seed" that influences red (2) placement, often along its column, but in complex cases, the red expands horizontally or forms connected shapes (e.g., horizontal bars or diagonal-ish fills) that interact with other input colors like blue (3) or green (1), suggesting rules for propagation, connection, or mirroring.
 * Non-maroon elements (1,3,4) in the input are "removed" or absorbed into the background (set to 8) unless they directly contribute to red filling; however, their positions may guide where red spreads, such as filling entire rows/columns or bounded regions around yellow.
 * Subtle element: Red patterns in expected outputs often form symmetric or expanding blobs (e.g., in train2, rows 4-5 have wide horizontal red fills from columns 8-21, while upper/lower rows have partial verticals at columns 19-20), indicating that yellow's column may trigger vertical fills that widen or connect horizontally based on nearby non-maroon clusters—easy to miss that it's not just a simple column fill.
 * Background is always initialized to maroon (8), and red (2) overrides only specific influenced areas; over-filling (e.g., entire columns without bounds) leads to excess red where expected outputs have isolated or partial fills.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., train2: 23 rows x 25 cols, train3: 23x22, train4/test: 27x27?), so code must handle dynamic h/w; yellow may not always exist or be unique, defaulting to no fill.
 * Other colors: Green (1) and blue (3) seem to define boundaries or extenders for red (e.g., in train3 expected, reds form a central cross-like shape around what might be yellow-influenced areas), but absorbing them to 8 first prevents direct copying—subtlety is that their positions indirectly shape red without preserving their color.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs show "eroded" or simplified versions of input structures, where connected components of non-8 cells near yellow get converted to red blobs, but disconnected ones stay 8; vertical alignment from yellow is core, but horizontal spread varies by row (e.g., wider in "middle" rows).
 * All training examples (except train1) have top/bottom rows fully 8, with red concentrated in mid-grid, suggesting vertical bounding or gradient-like expansion from yellow's row/column.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly handled train1 by filling the entire yellow column with red (2) on maroon (8) background after absorbing non-maroon to 8, matching a simple vertical line case.
 * Failed train2: Generated a uniform vertical red line in column 10 across all 23 rows, but expected has varied red patterns—e.g., rows 0-2 and 19-22 have partial reds only at columns 19-20, rows 4-5 have full horizontal reds from 8-21, rows 13-14 have shorter horizontals at 8-11, and row 16 has a single red at column 10; difference is lack of horizontal expansion or row-specific bounding, resulting in excess vertical red everywhere instead of clustered blobs.
 * Failed train3: Generated vertical red in column 16 across all 23 rows, but expected has complex central reds—e.g., rows 2-3 have partial at 16-19 and 4-7, rows 4-5 have wide horizontals from 2-21, row 14 has partial at 0-7 and 16, row 15 has full left horizontal 0-7; difference is over-filling the whole column vs. forming cross-like or bounded shapes, ignoring horizontal connections from other non-maroons.
 * Failed train4: Generated vertical red in column 5 across all 27 rows, but expected has mid-grid concentrations—e.g., rows 3-4 partial at 4-7, rows 5-6 full horizontals 2-21, rows 7-8 partial at 3-7, rows 9+ sparse vertical at 5; difference is uniform vertical fill vs. expanding horizontals in central rows, with top/bottom fully 8.
 * Function `remove_non_maroon_elements` is unhelpful/broken: It sets 1,3,4 to 8 on the output grid (which starts as 8 anyway), but doesn't use input positions to guide red placement—essentially does nothing useful beyond init; don't use it, as it ignores propagation rules.
 * Function `fill_red_column` is partially helpful for vertical base but insufficient alone, as it blindly fills entire column without row bounds or horizontal spread.
 * Function `find_yellow_column` is helpful for locating yellow but incomplete—needs row position too, and doesn't account for multi-yellow or interactions.
 * Overall, attempt shows basic understanding of yellow-as-trigger and maroon background, but misses core subtlety of shape formation (e.g., connected components or distance-based fill from yellow), leading to simplistic column-only outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it generates a single uniform vertical red (2) line in column 5 across all 27 rows on maroon (8), similar to failures in train2-4, suggesting the same over-simplification.
 * Based on patterns in incorrect trainings, expected test output likely has more complex red structures: probably horizontal expansions or bounded blobs around column 5 in mid-rows (e.g., wider fills in rows ~5-20, partial verticals elsewhere), with top/bottom rows fully 8 and no full-column red, as uniform verticals mismatched all complex expectations.
 * It fails to account for subtle horizontal propagation or bounding, making the output too sparse/simplistic—e.g., if test input has clustered non-maroons near yellow, reds should form shapes like in train3's cross, but here it's just a line, indicating the program doesn't detect or fill those.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, 4=yellow, 8=maroon) where the goal is to transform the input grid by identifying a key "red column" based on the position of yellow cells (4) relative to initial red bars (2), replacing non-red/non-maroon elements with maroon (8) while preserving or extending reds in a way that fills vertical gaps or connects components in that column, resulting in a output grid that emphasizes extended red structures amid a maroon background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The yellow (4) cell(s) mark the "red column" as the vertical column containing the yellow, which is positioned above or near initial red bars (2); this column needs vertical extension of reds to full height or to fill "holes" (gaps of non-red cells), but not necessarily overwriting everything indiscriminately—initial reds elsewhere must be preserved if they form connected bars or components.
 * Non-red/non-maroon cells (1,3,4) are replaced with maroon (8), but initial reds (2) are preserved globally, not just in the red column; the extension only affects the identified column to resolve vertical discontinuities (e.g., filling gaps between red bars in that column).
 * Subtle element: The puzzle may involve "stacking" or "dropping" reds downward from the yellow's position, connecting multiple horizontal red bars into vertical structures only in the target column, while horizontal reds in other columns remain if they are initial; overlooking this leads to over-extension (full columns of 2s) or loss of multi-column red shapes.
 * Grids have varying widths (e.g., 22-27 columns) and heights (e.g., 23-27 rows), so code must handle dynamic dimensions; assume rectangular grids.
 * Potential for multiple yellows or complex red shapes: Examples show single yellow per case, but expectations have asymmetric red extensions (e.g., partial vertical fills, not full height everywhere).
 * Easy to miss: The transformation resolves "splits" in maroon by filling the red column, but does not create new horizontal reds—only vertical extension in the target column; initial reds outside the column stay as-is after maroon replacement.
 * All cells become 8 except preserved/extended 2s; yellow (4) itself becomes 8 after identifying the column.
 * Considerations across attempts: Finding the yellow column works (as in example 1), but uniform full-height overwrite fails when expectations show partial fills or preserved horizontal bars; need to detect initial red positions in the column and fill only gaps between them, not the entire column.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes modular functions, but only `find_red_column` is reliably helpful (correctly identifies the yellow-based column in all cases). The other functions are broken or overly simplistic: `remove_non_maroon_and_red` correctly preserves initial 2s but sets too much to 8 without considering post-extension needs; `extend_red_to_full_height` is unhelpful/broken as it blindly fills the entire column, ignoring gap-filling logic and causing over-extension in examples 2-4 and test.

```python
from typing import List

def find_red_column(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Rule: The red column is the column containing the yellow (4) cell, which is stacked above the initial red bar (2s)."""
    height = len(g)
    width = len(g[0]) if height > 0 else 0
    red_col = -1
    for r in range(height):
        for c in range(width):
            if g[r][c] == 4:
                red_col = c
                break
        if red_col != -1:
            break
    # Verify with 2s if needed, but assume unique 4
    return red_col
```

No other functions from this attempt are helpful; `remove_non_maroon_and_red` and `extend_red_to_full_height` should be revised or replaced (e.g., with a gap-filling function that scans the target column for 2-regions and fills non-2 gaps between min/max row of 2s in that column). No extraction functions for objects (e.g., detecting red bars or components) were provided, but one could be added to identify connected red regions per column for better gap detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program) correctly handled training example 1 by identifying the yellow column and extending it fully, matching the expected simple vertical red fill amid maroon.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated a single full-height column of 2s (column ~10, all rows 2s, rest 8s), but expected preserves multiple horizontal red bars (e.g., rows 4-5 have wide 2s from col 8-21, rows 0-2/6-7/14-23 have partial 2s in cols 19-20 or col 9-10) and only partially fills vertically in the yellow's column (not full height; e.g., gaps remain as 8s in upper/lower parts)—over-extension erased horizontal structures and didn't match asymmetric fills.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated a single full-height column of 2s (column 16, all rows 2s, rest 8s), but expected has multiple horizontal red bars (e.g., rows 4-5/13-14/16-17 have wide 2s across cols 2-20, with vertical connections in cols 4-5 and 16-19) and partial vertical fills only between initial red bars in the target column(s)—ignored multi-column connections and overfilled.
 * Failed training example 4: Generated a single full-height column of 2s (column 5, all rows 2s, rest 8s), but expected preserves horizontal reds (e.g., rows 5-7/21-22 have wide 2s across cols 2-21) and shows partial vertical extension in column 5 (e.g., fills from row 3 downward but not fully, with horizontals intact)—lost initial horizontal reds outside the column.
 * Overall: The column identification via yellow works (core element), but the maroon replacement + full extension logic is broken, as it doesn't preserve or connect initial red bars properly; it treats the target column as uniform fill instead of gap-filling between existing 2s. No object extraction was used, which might help detect red components. Subtleties like partial fills (not full height) and horizontal preservation were missed. The `program` composition is a good structure but needs refined extension logic (e.g., find min/max row with 2s in target column and fill only between them).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows a single full-height column of 2s (column 5, across all ~27 rows, rest 8s), which follows the attempt's flawed full-extension logic but likely mismatches the expected pattern based on training examples—expectations consistently show partial vertical fills (e.g., only between initial red bars) and preserved horizontal reds in other columns, not a uniform column overwrite. Without the test input grid, it's hard to confirm exact mismatches, but this over-simplistic output ignores subtleties like gap-filling only where reds are "stacked" below yellow, potentially erasing complex shapes; it makes sense under the attempt's rules but not the puzzle's, as it would fail similarly to examples 2-4 (e.g., if test has horizontal reds or partial stacks, they'd be lost to 8s except in col 5).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid representation of tree-like structures (trunks and branches) using numbers: likely 1/2 for red elements (solid trunk/branch), 3/4 for green/yellow elements (leafy or branch tips), with the goal of filling valid connected tree components into 2's (solid fill) while setting invalid or unconnected parts to 8's (background/empty), following rules for trunk identification, horizontal/vertical propagation, intersections, and merges without overfilling disconnected or invalid branches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Trunk is a vertical column identified by the lowest 2 or 4; it must be filled solidly from the highest intersection point downward, but not above unless connected via branches.
 * Branches (horizontal spans of 1/3 or 2/4) only fill if they intersect the trunk or are connected via propagation; disconnected branches stay as 8's after final cleanup.
 * Yellow (4) treats as red (2) initially for filling, but original grid (original_g) must be preserved for checks like green-only bridges or top-row extensions.
 * Propagation is vertical (up/down) along connected 1/3 spans triggered by 2's above/below, but must expand horizontally to full connected spans without overextending to disconnected areas.
 * Merging: Multiple 2 spans in a row merge only if bridged by original green (3) in at least one spanning segment that touches the trunk; otherwise, they remain separate or get cleared to 8.
 * Green components (3/4) fill differently: left/top greens skip if no above connection (isolated), but right/top greens may extend upward if filled; avoid filling isolated green blobs.
 * Subtle: Highest intersection is the topmost row with 1/3 in trunk column; stem fill starts there downward. Avoid overpropagation in loops (code uses h iterations, which may be excessive). Final step clears all remaining 1/3 to 8, so only validated 2's survive.
 * Easy to miss: Branches don't fill if they don't touch trunk directly or via propagation; no diagonal connections. Top-row greens on right may extend full height upward only if already filled. In multi-trunk-like setups, only one trunk column is chosen (lowest). Overfilling happens when propagation/merging ignores green-bridge requirements or expands left unnecessarily for non-trunk-touching greens.
 * All attempts must handle varying widths/heights; copy grid to avoid mutating input. Unfilled areas default to 8, but input may have other numbers—assume 0/empty is 8-equivalent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it passed training example 1 (simple trunk/branches correctly filled without overfill), demonstrating core understanding of trunk detection, intersection filling, and stem fill.
 * Failed training 2: Overfilled row 3 (full 0-20 as 2's vs. expected only 9-10 and 19-20), rows 4-5 (extra left 2's at 1- vs. expected starting at 8), row 6 (extra 2-3 2's vs. none), rows 7-12/16-17 (persistent 9-10 2's without vertical connection vs. expected cleared to 8 in most), row 13 (8-11 vs. expected none), row 14 (7-11 vs. 8-? but shifted left), row 15 (8-11 vs. none); rows 0-2 extra 9-10 2's (disconnected, should be 8). Likely due to faulty fill_green_components expanding left unnecessarily and propagate_vertical over-spreading without green checks.
 * Failed training 3: Overfilled row 7 (0-5 2's vs. expected none there, should be 8's), row 8 (16-17 2's vs. 16-17 but wait, expected has 16-17 in row 7? Wait, mismatch in vertical: generated has extra trunk-like 2's in left without connection); row 12 (4-5 vs. expected 4-5 but propagate added extras?); rows 18-22 (16 single 2 vs. expected 16 single, but overfill in row 7 suggests propagation bug); unknown why row 7 left-filled when expected clears it—possibly apply_merge wrongly bridged without green.
 * Failed training 4: Overfilled rows 13-14 (full 0-17 2's vs. expected none in row 13, only trunk in 14? Wait, expected row 13 none, row 14 14-15 2's? No, expected has sparse; generated added extra horizontal in 13 from bad merge/propagate); rows 5-7 (extra right 2's in 13-21 vs. expected full but only if connected—overfill in row 5 13-21 when expected stops at 21? Lists show generated misses full row 5-6 connection); unknown blob shape mismatch in lower right (generated sparse 14 2's vs. expected full horizontal in some).
 * fill_green_components is buggy/not helpful: Skips left/top greens correctly but wrongly expands left to 0 for non-trunk greens, causing overfill (e.g., train 2 row 3 full); remove or fix skip logic for isolated greens.
 * propagate_vertical is somewhat helpful but over-iterates (h times may loop too much, spreading to disconnected); unhelpful as-is due to no boundary on expansion—add checks for trunk proximity.
 * apply_merge is broken: Merges spans if any has green bridge touching trunk, but applies globally per row without verifying all spans connect, leading to over-merges (e.g., train 2 row 3 full merge); not helpful without stricter per-span validation.
 * extend_top_green_right is unhelpful/broken: Only extends upward if already filled and top-row green on right, but condition grid[r][c]==2 triggers wrongly on non-top, causing vertical overfill (e.g., train 3 row 7); ignore or rewrite for true top-only (r==0).
 * Overall, core trunk/intersect/stem work (passed train 1), but green handling, propagation, and merging fail on disconnected/multi-branch cases, leaving extra 2's instead of 8's.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills several areas similar to training failures, e.g., row 3 full 0-15 2's (likely bad green expand/merge, should be sparser branches only touching trunk at ~16), rows 4-7 extra left 2's (1- vs. expected starting later, disconnected), row 12 full 0-15 2's (over-propagate from above without connection), row 14-15 extra right 16-21 2's (should be limited to trunk-touching spans), lower rows 18-26 single 5 2's (trunk?) but sparse without horizontal branches vs. expected fuller if connected—mismatches suggest same bugs as train 2/3 (over-expansion left/right without green bridges or top checks). It partially captures trunk at col 5 and right branches at 16-17, but extras make it invalid; account for multi-level branches and stricter connectivity to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based logic puzzle (likely a variant of a connection or region-filling puzzle like a tree-drawing or path-completion challenge) where the input grid contains clues (numbers like 1 for interior points, 3 for edge/endpoint markers, 4 for a starting stem point, 2 for pre-filled paths, and 8 for barriers or empty space), and the goal is to output a new grid filling connected regions or paths with 2s based on rules for stems, gaps, flooding, and edge extensions, while leaving unfilled areas as 8s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle emphasizes connectivity: filled areas (2s) must connect clues like 1s (which seem to require enclosure or path inclusion) and 3s (which act as borders or endpoints that trigger gap-filling or extensions), but only through non-8 cells; 8s act as hard barriers that split groups.
 * Stem filling starts from a unique column containing a 4 (likely a root or base clue) and fills downward or in a primary block from the top, but only in that column initially; subtle: if multiple non-8 blocks exist in the stem column, it prioritizes the topmost block's start row, which could miss multi-block stems if not handled.
 * Gap filling (horizontal or vertical) only occurs between adjacent groups of non-8 cells if both groups contain at least one 1, and at least one bordering cell (the end of the upper/left group or start of the lower/right group) is a 3; this bridges separated regions but skips if no 1s or no 3 border, preventing over-filling isolated clues.
 * Flood fill propagates from any initial 2s (including stems, pre-filled 2s/4s, and gaps) into adjacent (4-directional) cells that are 1 or 3, marking them as 2s; key subtlety: it does not fill into 8s, 2s (already filled), or other numbers, and uses BFS to ensure full connectivity without revisiting; this can expand regions but risks over-filling if initial seeds are wrong.
 * Edge extensions (horizontal or vertical) only apply to the first/last group in a row/column if it starts/ends with a 3, contains a 1, and has any 2s already; it then fills outward to the grid edge; subtle: this handles "open-ended" paths but requires prior filling (from flood or gaps) to trigger, and only for groups with 1s, avoiding extension of empty or clue-less edges.
 * Pre-filled handling: Any input 2 or 4 must be copied as 2s in output, serving as seeds; 1 and 3 are fillable but not initial seeds unless connected.
 * Overall process order matters: stem first, then copy seeds, then gaps (which may create new seeds), then flood (expands everything), then extensions (which rely on prior filling); running in wrong order could miss propagations.
 * Subtle elements easy to miss: Groups are defined by consecutive non-8 cells, ignoring isolated 8s; no filling into or across full 8 barriers; 4 is only for stem location, not general filling; potential for multiple iterations if gaps/extensions create new opportunities, but current code does single passes; handles empty grid edge case; assumes rectangular grid with uniform width.
 * Considerations across attempts: No diagonal connections (only 4 dirs); no looping or enclosure checks (pure connectivity); 1s seem mandatory to include (via flood/gaps), but 3s are optional unless bordering; potential for disconnected components if no connecting 3 or shared 1s.

(Note: Functions like fill_horizontal_gaps, fill_vertical_gaps, extend_horizontal_edges, and extend_vertical_edges are helpful extensions of the group-extraction logic above, applying conditional filling based on 1s and 3s; they are not broken but depend on get_groups_* working correctly. The main program orchestrates them in sequence, which is useful for the overall pipeline.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None explicitly broken in this attempt, but the gap-filling functions (fill_horizontal_gaps/fill_vertical_gaps) could be unhelpful if they over-fill without checking for prior flood results, as they run before flood—might need iteration. No extraction functions for full "objects" (e.g., bounding boxes of connected 1/3 regions) were included, which could be added for better group analysis but isn't essential yet.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handled all 4 training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of stem filling, gap bridging with 1+3 conditions, flood propagation into 1/3, and edge extensions from 3s.
 * What worked: Stem correctly identifies and fills from 4's column (e.g., vertical line of 2s); gaps properly bridge only qualifying segments (with 1s and 3 borders); flood ensures connected 1/3 inclusion without crossing 8s; extensions handle open 3-ends post-filling; order of operations allows propagation (gaps seed flood, flood seeds extensions).
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the output fills a vertical stem in column 5 (indices 0-based, starting ~row 4 downward, matching a likely 4 position), copies presumed input 2/4 as 2s, creates horizontal "arms" (e.g., rows 3-4 cols 2-6, row 5 cols 1-8), a mid-blob (rows 5-7 cols 1-20ish with breaks), and vertical fills (e.g., col 16-17 partial), but leaves large areas (e.g., bottom rows 17-26 only stem 2s in col 5, no extensions) as 8s; this may miss deeper connections if input has isolated 1/3 groups not bridged by gaps or if extensions don't trigger due to no prior 2s in edge groups—unknown if input has such cases, but output seems under-filled compared to a full "tree" expectation (e.g., no full horizontal spans in lower rows despite potential 3 borders).
 * Subtleties missed potentially: Single-pass gaps/flood may not handle chained propagations (e.g., a gap creating a 2 that enables another gap); stem assumes top-block priority, which works for training but could fail if test stem is mid-grid without top connection; no validation that all 1s are filled (output has 8s near potential 1s? unknown without input grid).
 * Group extraction (get_groups_*) is essential for gaps/extensions and worked well in training; flood_fill is core and correctly limited to 1/3.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt shows partial understanding—training passed due to simple connected clues, but test may reveal gaps in handling sparse or multi-level connections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (27x27 grid) makes partial sense: It correctly forms a central vertical stem of 2s in column 5 (from ~row 4 to bottom), with horizontal extensions in upper-mid rows (e.g., row 3: cols 3-6; row 4: cols 2-7+16-17; row 5: cols 1-9+16-19), a filled blob in rows 5-7 cols 1-9 and partial in 16-19, and thinner verticals in cols 16-17 rows 0-10ish; this looks like a tree-like structure with branches, aligning with stem+gaps+flood rules if the input has a 4 in col 5, 1s in branch groups, and 3s at edges.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower rows (17-26) are only the stem 2 in col 5 with all else 8s, suggesting missed vertical gaps or extensions (e.g., if input has 1s+3s below, they should bridge/flood but didn't—possibly no connecting 3 borders or isolated groups); upper rows (0-2) have minimal 2s (only partial in cols 16-17), potentially under-filling if input has connectable 1/3 there; no full grid-spanning fills, and many 8-regions persist, which might leave 1s unfilled (unknown without input, but differs from expectation of comprehensive connectivity if puzzle requires all 1s included); overall, under-filled compared to training successes, likely missing iterative propagation or broader gap conditions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic puzzle similar to a nonogram or region-filling grid (e.g., Nurikabe or a custom deduction puzzle), where the input grid contains clues (1 for interior/object cells, 3 for borders/edges, 4 for special stem markers, 2 for pre-filled regions, and 8 for unknown/empty cells), and the goal is to deduce and fill unknown cells (8s) with 2s to complete connected regions or objects while respecting separation by empties and border rules. The program iteratively applies deduction rules to propagate fillings from clues and pre-fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions or "objects" are defined as contiguous groups of non-8 cells (clues 1,2,3,4), separated by 8s; these groups must be analyzed horizontally and vertically for connections, gaps, and extensions.
 * Gaps between adjacent groups can be filled with 2s only if both groups contain at least one 1 (interior clue) and at least one bordering group ends with a 3 (border clue), indicating a continuous region across the gap.
 * Flood fill propagates 2s from known 2s into adjacent 8s only if the target cell's clue is 1 or 3 (part of an object), but not into pure empties or other clues; this must be careful to avoid overfilling disconnected areas.
 * Special handling for "stem" columns identified by 4s: these seem to indicate a vertical backbone that should be filled starting from the top of the first non-8 block downward, potentially spanning the entire height if it's a single continuous block.
 * Extensions from borders: If a group has a 3 at its edge (left/right for horizontal, top/bottom for vertical) and contains both a 1 and a known 2, extend filling into adjacent 8s beyond the border in that direction, simulating region growth.
 * Iteration is key: Rules must be applied in a loop until no changes occur, as propagations can chain (e.g., gap fill enables flood fill, which enables extension).
 * Pre-filled 2s and 4s are copied directly and treated as known; 4s are not propagated as 2s but used only for stem detection.
 * Subtlety: Groups are strictly contiguous non-8 sequences; single-cell groups or isolated 1/3s may not trigger fills without adjacent 2s or borders. Avoid filling into areas without any 1/3 support, as 8s outside objects should remain 8 (empties).
 * Edge cases: Empty rows/columns (all 8s) skip processing; stems with multiple disconnected blocks start filling from the topmost block but only downward; no diagonal connections (only orthogonal).
 * Potential misses: Over-reliance on borders (3s) without confirming object presence (1s); incomplete flood fill that doesn't revisit after initial queue; failure to handle stems that don't span full height or have gaps.

(Note: Other functions like fill_horizontal_gaps, fill_vertical_gaps, extend_horizontal, extend_vertical, and the stem-filling logic in program() are also helpful and build on these, but the group extraction and flood fill are core building blocks. The overall program() wrapper with iteration loop is essential for chaining rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly identifying stems via 4s, filling gaps between clue groups with 1s and 3-borders, propagating via flood fill into 1/3 areas, and extending from borders when groups had mixed 1s and 2s.
 * Worked well for cases with single continuous stems and horizontal/vertical propagations, as evidenced by 100% training accuracy.
 * Stem detection and downward filling from the topmost non-8 block in the 4-column is a key insight that likely succeeded in training.
 * Gap-filling logic correctly requires both adjacent groups to have 1s and at least one 3-border, preventing invalid connections.
 * Iterative loop ensures changes propagate fully, which was crucial for training cases with chained deductions.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., get_groups_row/col, flood_fill) are relevant and functional, though the stem block-merging logic assumes single-block stems for full-height fill, which might be a subtlety.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills a vertical stem in column 5 (index 5, 0-based) with 2s starting from row 1 downward across all 27 rows, which aligns with stem rules if a 4 was present there and it formed a single block.
 * Horizontal fills create a rough "tree-like" or "structure" shape: e.g., row 3 has 2s in cols 3-6, row 4 extends to cols 2-7, row 5 to cols 1-8, rows 6-7 fill cols 1-19 partially, row 8 mirrors row 5, etc., and a vertical band in cols 16-18 with 2s in most rows, suggesting gap-fills and extensions worked for a central object.
 * However, the output does not look fully correct or complete: ~70-80% of the grid remains 8s (e.g., entire right side cols 20-26 are all 8s except sparse 2s, top rows 0-2 have minimal fills, bottom rows 18-26 have only stem 2s), indicating potential misses in flood fill propagation, vertical extensions, or gap fills for disconnected or edge objects.
 * Specific differences: Rows 0-2 have only sparse 2s in cols 16-17, but if the input has 1/3 clues there, flood fill should have expanded more; row 14 has 2s in cols 14-18 but not extended left/right despite apparent group patterns; no fills in cols 0-0 or 19+ suggest missed horizontal extensions from 3-borders or incomplete iteration.
 * The output makes partial sense for a sparse puzzle with a tall stem and one main object, but it seems under-filled compared to what iterative rules should achieve if the input has multiple 1/3 groups—likely missing chained vertical gap fills or flood into upper/lower extensions, leaving isolated 8s within clue areas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where cells contain clues (1 for internal points, 3 for borders/edges, 4 for stem anchors, 2 for pre-filled stems/connections, and 8 for empty space), and the goal is to propagate and fill additional stem/connections (with 2's) based on rules for vertical stems, horizontal/vertical gap filling between groups, flood-filling connected areas, and extending edges from borders, ultimately completing object outlines or linkages without overfilling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Vertical stems (from 4) should fill downward from the lowest non-8 row in the column, but only if there's a single block of non-8's or starting from the topmost block; multiple disconnected blocks require starting from the absolute top (row 0) to avoid partial fills.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical) only triggers between adjacent non-8 groups if both groups contain at least one 1 (internal clue), and at least one bordering cell is 3 (edge clue); this ensures connections are justified by internal structure, not just proximity, and only fills 8's in the gap.
 * Flood-fill propagates 2's only into adjacent 8's that overlie 1 or 3 in the input grid, treating 2's as seeds for connected components but respecting the underlying clues to avoid filling arbitrary empties.
 * Edge extension (horizontal/vertical) applies only to the outermost groups in rows/columns: if the edge cell is 3 and the group has a 1 and already some 2's, extend filling into leading/trailing 8's across the entire row/column prefix/suffix, simulating full boundary completion.
 * Iteration is key: all filling steps (gaps, flood, edges) must loop until no changes, as propagations can chain (e.g., a new 2 from gaps enables flood-fill).
 * Subtlety: Pre-fill all existing 2's and 4's as 2's in output; ignore 8's in input for grouping but use them as barriers; do not fill over non-8 clues or outside grid.
 * Easy to miss: Stem column detection scans entire grid for any 4 (assumes single stem); groups skip 8's entirely, treating them as separators; flood-fill uses BFS but only on 8's overlying 1/3, not pure 8's; extensions can fill entire empty prefixes/suffixes if conditions met, potentially creating long arms.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no stem (stem_col=-1 skips fill_stem); ensure changed flags accumulate across steps to control loop; avoid filling if no 1 in group (prevents spurious connections); vertical/horizontal symmetry in gap/edge functions, but stem is vertical-only; potential overfill if flood escapes via 3's without bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples, correctly filling stems, gaps, floods, and edges to complete the expected outputs.
 * Stem filling worked well for single-block cases but may underfill in multi-block scenarios if start_row logic doesn't always default to 0 (code sets to min(blocks[0]) for multiple, which could skip upper empties if top block isn't at 0).
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical) correctly conditioned on 1's and bordering 3's, enabling connections in training but potentially missing chained propagations if iteration order matters.
 * Flood-fill and edge extensions propagated correctly in training, demonstrating understanding of connected components and boundary completion.
 * Overall loop with changed flags ensured convergence without infinite loops.
 * No major misses in training, but subtle edge cases like no-stem grids or fully empty rows/columns were implicitly handled by skipping.
 * Functions like find_column, get_row_groups, get_col_groups are essential and correct for grouping; fill_stem is helpful but its block logic may need review for starting row in multi-block stems.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant; extend_horizontal_edges and extend_vertical_edges are key for boundary filling but could overextend if 2's are pre-present without 1's (though code checks has1).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 27x27 grid mostly filled with 8's (empties), with 2's forming a large irregular blob/structure in the upper-left (rows 3-9, cols 2-8+), a vertical stem-like line in col 5 from row 10 downward to bottom, scattered horizontal fills in rows 4-5 and 14-16 around cols 16-19, and minimal other 2's (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 16-17).
 * This appears partially correct: the upper blob looks like a connected object fill via flood/gaps/edges, and the long vertical 2's in col 5 suggest proper stem filling from a 4 anchor, extending downward; horizontal extensions in mid-right seem to bridge small groups.
 * However, it does not look fully correct—large empty areas (e.g., bottom-right, most of cols 0-4 below row 9, and entire rows 18-26 except col 5) remain 8's, which may indicate missed vertical extensions or gap fills if the input has underlying 1/3's there; for example, if test input has disconnected lower objects with 3 borders and 1's, gaps or edges should propagate more 2's, but output leaves them isolated.
 * Subtle differences: The output has abrupt cutoffs (e.g., row 9 ends blob sharply, row 17 has isolated 2's in cols 16-19 without vertical ties), suggesting flood-fill didn't chain fully or stem didn't extend horizontally; expected output likely has more interconnected 2's forming complete object linkages, but this seems underfilled in lower sections for unknown reasons (possibly input lacks sufficient 1/3 triggers or grouping skips key areas).
 * The right-side vertical pairs (e.g., cols 16-17 in upper rows) look like partial edge extensions, but inconsistent downward propagation hints at broken vertical gap logic for sparse columns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving filling connected regions (likely representing solid objects like shapes or organic forms such as trees/mushrooms) based on partial outlines and structural elements, where numbers like 1 (interior points), 3 (boundaries/edges), 4 (stem starters), 2 (pre-filled or to-fill solid), and 8 (empty/background) guide the filling process to complete coherent blobs without overfilling isolated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Identify a "stem" column via a 4 marker and fill downward from the top (or the first non-8 block) with 2s, treating it as a vertical anchor that connects to overhead structures.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical): Between groups of non-8 cells separated by 8s, fill gaps with 2s only if an adjacent 3 (edge) borders the gap and the group contains at least one 1 (interior), ensuring fills bridge logical continuations without arbitrary extensions.
 * Flood fill: Propagate 2s into adjacent (4-directional) 1s and 3s that are unvisited, but only after initial placements; this connects interiors and boundaries but skips 8s and already-filled areas to avoid spilling into voids.
 * Edge extensions: For boundary groups (left/right for rows, top/bottom for columns), extend fills outward only if the edge cell is a 3, the group has a 1, and some part is already filled with 2—prevents over-extension into infinite empties but allows completing open-ended shapes.
 * Subtleties: 8s act as hard barriers, so groups are segmented by them; original 2s and 4s are preserved/treated as seeds; fills must respect object cohesion (e.g., no filling across unrelated 8-separated regions); potential for multiple blobs, but stem prioritizes vertical continuity; easy to miss that extensions require both a 3 at the edge AND a 1 inside, avoiding false positives on empty outlines.
 * Considerations: Order matters—stem first, then copy originals, gaps, flood, extensions—to build from structure outward; handles irregular shapes but may fail on diagonal connections (code uses only orthogonal); assumes single stem (returns -1 if none, but fills nothing extra); 1s confirm "fillable" interiors, 3s suggest permeable boundaries.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but the code builds a complete pipeline from stem detection to final extensions.
 * Successfully handled all 4 training examples (marked CORRECT), indicating strong grasp of core filling mechanics for standard cases like connected outlines with stems.
 * What worked: Stem filling anchors vertical structures correctly; gap filling bridges 8-separated groups conditionally; flood fill connects 1/3 regions orthogonally; extensions complete open edges without overreach.
 * What didn't work/missed: No explicit handling for multiple stems or non-stem objects (assumes single 4-column); potential oversight in diagonal connections (flood fill is orthogonal-only, which may fragment diagonal blobs); edge extensions check for filled parts but might not trigger if flood fill misses seeds; no validation for overfilling (e.g., if 3s form loops without 1s).
 * get_groups_row and get_col_groups are essential for segmenting inputs into fillable units.
 * fill_horizontal_gaps and fill_vertical_gaps correctly condition on 3+1 presence but could be unhelpful if gaps are diagonal (not addressed).
 * extend_edges is helpful for boundary completion but may be broken for cases where the "highest/lowest" group isn't the absolute edge due to leading 8s.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem relevant, though flood_fill's orthogonal limitation might need 8-directional dirs for some puzzles.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output depicts a 27x27 grid (rows listed as 1D arrays) with a prominent vertical "stem" of 2s in columns 16-17 from row 0 downward (full height, double-thick at top), suggesting correct stem filling from a 4 marker.
 * A large irregular blob of 2s on the left (rows 3-9, columns 2-8 and extending rightward variably) resembles foliage or a crown, connected via flood/gaps, with a smaller vertical extension in column 5 from row 4 to bottom (thin trunk-like).
 * Bottom half (rows 13+) shows only the main stem filled (single or double 2s in col 16-17), with isolated 2s in col 5, and all else 8s—no horizontal branching or fills, which makes sense if input has no 1/3 clues there.
 * Overall, the output looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., no fills in pure 8 areas, connections via 1/3 implied), forming a tree-like shape; it makes sense as correct if the test input has a stemmed object with left-side canopy and a separate thin vertical element, but without input grid, can't confirm if flood missed any 1/3 regions or if extensions over/under-filled boundaries—appears visually plausible and not obviously wrong (e.g., no stray 2s in voids).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle solver where the goal is to fill in a output grid (using 2 for filled cells) based on input clues: 1 (likely internal elements like dots or leaves), 2 (pre-filled), 3 (borders or edges), 4 (stem starters), and 8 (empty/unknown). The solver connects and extends these into coherent shapes, such as stems, branches, or objects, by filling gaps, flooding adjacent areas, and extending from borders, likely representing organic structures like plants or trees in a logic puzzle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify and fully fill vertical "stem" columns starting from any 4 clue, extending downward (or fully if isolated), but only in non-8 areas of the input—subtlety: stems may not span the entire height if blocked by 8's, and blocks of non-8 rows need grouping to determine fill range.
 * Horizontal and vertical gap filling between groups of non-8 cells only if both sides contain at least one 1 (indicating content) and at least one side has a 3 border—easy to miss: gaps must be strictly separated (no overlap), and filling only occurs in 8's without overwriting existing non-8's.
 * Flood fill from any 2 into orthogonally adjacent 1 or 3 cells that are still 8, but not into 8-only areas or other numbers—subtlety: this is iterative and can propagate changes, but must respect input boundaries (no filling pure 8 regions).
 * Edge extension from 3 borders outward (up/down for vertical, left/right for horizontal) only if the group has both 1 (content) and 2 (already filled)—key miss: extensions stop at grid edges or existing non-8's, and only apply to the outermost groups per row/column.
 * Iteration is crucial: all filling steps (gaps, flood, extensions) run in a loop until no changes, as each can enable the next (e.g., gap fill enables flood).
 * Input groups (rows/columns) ignore 8's as separators, treating consecutive non-8's as blocks—subtlety: empty rows/columns (all 8's) skip processing.
 * No overwriting of input non-8 cells; output starts as copy of 2/4 to 2, rest 8.
 * Potential for multiple components: solver handles per-row/column independently but flood connects across.
 * Subtle edge case: if no stem (no 4), no special stem fill, but other rules still apply.
 * Over-extension risk: extensions only if both 1 and 2 present, preventing filling empty bordered areas.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from collections import deque

def find_stem_column(g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> int:
    # Finds column index of any 4 (stem start); returns -1 if none. Helpful for identifying vertical trunks.

```

    # Extracts start-end tuples for consecutive non-8 segments in a row. Essential for gap filling and extensions per row.
    groups: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    j: int = 0
    while j < w:
        if row[j] == 8:
            j += 1
            continue

    # Similar to get_row_groups but for columns. Essential for vertical processing.
    groups: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []

        groups.append((s, i - 1))

```

```python

    # BFS from all initial 2's to fill adjacent 8's that are 1 or 3 in input. Returns if changed; core for connecting components.

    q: deque = deque()
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(w):

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; no prior iterations to compare directly.
 * Stem filling works well: correctly identifies and fills vertical columns from 4, grouping non-8 blocks appropriately.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical) succeeds in training examples by bridging separated groups with 1's and 3's, but may underfill if iterations don't propagate fully (e.g., new 2's from one step enabling later gaps).
 * Flood fill is effective for connecting adjacent 1/3 areas but only after initial fills; subtlety missed in isolation: it doesn't fill pure 8 gaps without a 1/3 anchor.
 * Edge extensions handle outward growth from 3's correctly in training, but could overextend if 1/2 checks are too loose (though not observed here).
 * Overall loop iterates all steps until stable, which is key and worked for all training examples (all CORRECT).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_stem, fill_stem, get_groups, fill_gaps, flood_fill, extend_edges) are relevant and build toward shape completion.
 * extract_objects not present or needed; no object extraction attempted, as puzzle seems rule-based filling rather than high-level parsing.

**Test output:**
 * The test output forms a coherent vertical stem in column 5 (0-indexed) with 2's from roughly row 4 to row 25, plus horizontal branches (e.g., row 4: 2's cols 1-7; row 5: 2's cols 1-9 and 15-19; similar patterns upward to row 2), tapering off at the bottom with isolated 2's in rows 17-25 col 5 only—looks like a tree trunk with upper branches, leaving lower grid as 8's.
 * This makes sense for a puzzle with a central stem (likely a 4 in input col 5) and horizontal clues (1's and 3's) in upper rows forming branches; flood and gap fills connected them without overfilling the bottom (possibly no 1/3 clues there).
 * No obvious errors: no stray 2's in empty areas, extensions seem bounded, and structure matches organic puzzle expectations (e.g., no full-grid fill).
 * Minor concern: rows 0-1 have partial 2's only in cols 16-17 (possibly a small branch or stem extension), which might be correct if input has isolated 1/3 there, but could indicate underfilling if a larger connection was expected—unknown without input grid, but consistent with rules.
 * Overall, test output looks correct and demonstrates understanding, as it avoids common pitfalls like filling all 8's or ignoring stems.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs (1-4), the following are the only consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships between elements (e.g., positional adjacency, structural embedding) that appear without variation. No high-level interpretations or puzzle-solving inferences are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., varying hole counts in Maroon, exact pixel totals, or canvas dimensions) are excluded. Transformations from input to output are noted only where directly observable and consistent; unexplained aspects are flagged as unknown.

#### 1. **Yellow and Red (Positional Connection)**
   - **Description**: The Yellow element (always a single pixel, holes=0, pixels=1) consistently determines the starting position for the Red element. Red (holes=0, pixels=2-3) is placed as a vertical extension directly below Yellow.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (bbox): Red's x-coordinates match Yellow's x exactly (e.g., both centered at x=8 in Train 1, x=10 in Train 2). Red's y starts immediately adjacent below Yellow's y (e.g., Yellow y=9 → Red y=10 in Train 1; Yellow y=20 → Red y=21 in Train 2).
     - Shape/Structure: Red forms a thin vertical line (width=1 in bbox) extending from Yellow's position to the canvas bottom edge.
   - **Consistency**: Present and identical in structure across all train inputs. No other colors or elements influence this pairing.
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional dependency (Yellow position → Red position and extension).

#### 2. **Green and Blue (Positional Adjacency)**
   - **Description**: Every Green element (holes=0, pixels=1-2) is consistently positioned adjacent to or directly overlapping with at least one Blue element. Greens act as small accents relative to Blues.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (bbox): Green's bbox either overlaps or shares an edge with a Blue's bbox in x and/or y coordinates (e.g., vertical adjacency in Train 1: Green y=1 adjacent to Blue y=2-5; horizontal adjacency in Train 4: Green x=7 adjacent to Blue x=2-6). No Green exists in isolation.
     - Shape/Structure: Blues (holes=0, pixels=7-22) are blocky or rectangular; Greens are smaller (pixelated dots or lines) and align along Blue edges or interiors without altering Blue holes.
   - **Consistency**: Every Green has this adjacency to a Blue in all train inputs (multiple Greens per input, each paired). No exceptions or unpaired Greens.
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional alignment (Green position → Blue structure as accent).

#### 3. **Blue/Green and Maroon (Spatial Embedding)**
   - **Description**: All Blue and Green elements are consistently embedded within the Maroon's bounding box, contributing to Maroon's structure without independent positioning outside it.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (bbox): Blues and Greens occupy subspaces inside Maroon's full-canvas bbox (e.g., Maroon [0,0,14,12] contains Blue [1,2,4,5] and Green [2,1,3,1] in Train 1; similarly in all others). Yellow/Red may align near Maroon's lower edge but do not embed.
     - Shape/Structure: Maroon (holes>0 in input, pixels=175-518) surrounds Blues/Greens, with holes present (count varies: 1-4). Blues/Greens have no holes themselves but are non-Maroon pixels within Maroon's area.
   - **Consistency**: All Blues and Greens are internal to Maroon's bbox across every train input. Maroon always covers the entire canvas extent.
   - **Interaction Type**: Spatial containment (Blue/Green positions → Maroon as enclosing background with holes).

#### Notes on Transformations (Input to Output)
- **Consistent Changes**:
  - Blues, Greens, and Yellow are absent in all outputs (no trace in color, position, or pixels).
  - Red persists but changes from vertical line (pixels=2-3) to wider/spanning form (pixels=13-111, bbox expands horizontally or fills area).
  - Maroon holes reduce to 0 in all outputs; Maroon may split into multiple instances (2-3 per output) with adjusted bboxes and pixels (e.g., total Maroon pixels decrease: 175→182 in Train 1, but split).
- **Unknown Aspects**: The exact mechanism for Red's expansion (e.g., why horizontal in some outputs) or Maroon's splitting/filling (e.g., relation to input hole count or Blue positions) is not directly observable or consistent in a explainable way beyond the above input connections. Pixelated details or circular forms mentioned in the query are not evident in the output data (outputs show only Maroon/Red blocks). No further interactions can be identified without forcing inconsistencies.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:48:14] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based filling puzzle where the goal is to propagate "filled" cells (value 2) from initial seeds (2 or 4 in input) across a grid, respecting walls (8), clues (1), borders (3), and connectivity rules, ultimately filling connected regions while avoiding overfilling isolated or invalid areas. The process involves identifying stems, copying seeds, filling gaps between groups, flood-filling adjacent valid cells, and extending edges beyond borders under specific conditions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grid uses 8 for empty/wall spaces that block filling, 1 for clues that enable filling in adjacent empties during flood fill, 2 for initial seeds to copy and propagate, 3 for borders that can trigger gap-filling or edge extension if adjacent to groups with clues, and 4 for stem indicators that define a central column to fill vertically from the top or first block.
 * Stem filling starts from row 0 if there's only one block of non-8 cells in the stem column, or from the top of the first block otherwise, and fills downward to the bottom—subtlety: it assumes a single stem column and may overfill if multiple 4s exist or if blocks are misinterpreted.
 * Horizontal and vertical gap filling only occurs between consecutive non-8 groups in a row/column if both groups contain at least one 1 (clue) and at least one group ends/starts with a 3 (border); this bridges isolated segments but skips if no clues or borders, preventing invalid connections.
 * Flood fill propagates 2s only to adjacent 8s that are on 1 or 3 in the input (clues or borders), using BFS to connect components—key subtlety: it doesn't fill pure 8s without clues/borders, and it runs iteratively in a loop until no changes, allowing propagation to stabilize.
 * Edge extension for horizontals/verticals fills beyond the grid edges (left/right for rows, top/bottom for columns) into leading/trailing 8s only if the edge group starts/ends with a 3 (border), contains a 1 (clue), and already has some 2s filled—subtlety: this can extend fills outside "object" bounds but risks overfilling if applied too early or without prior 2s.
 * Overall loop repeats all fill operations until convergence, ensuring iterative propagation, but may miss cases where order matters (e.g., flood before gaps) or where multiple iterations are needed for complex shapes.
 * Non-8 groups are extracted per row/column to identify segments, ignoring isolated 8s—easy to miss: groups must be contiguous non-8s, and gaps are only between separate groups.
 * Output initializes to all 8s except copied seeds (2s), and only modifies 8s to 2s; no overwriting of existing 2s or other values.
 * Potential pitfalls: assuming single stem (find_stem_column takes first 4 found), not handling multiple stems, overextending edges without checks for global connectivity, or failing to fill if clues are absent; also, is_border/is_border_col functions are incomplete/buggy (always return False for some directions, as they only check ==3 but direction logic is flawed—e.g., left/right both check ==3 without position-specific logic).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples, correctly filling regions based on stems, seeds, gaps, flood fill, and edge extensions, demonstrating understanding of iterative propagation and group-based rules.
 * Stem filling worked well for single-column backbones but assumes one stem and fills from top/first block downward, which may not handle multi-stem or partial stems in training.
 * Gap filling (horizontal/vertical) correctly bridged segments with clues and borders, contributing to correct training outputs by connecting isolated parts.
 * Flood fill was effective for expanding from seeds into clue/border areas, a core mechanism that passed training.
 * Edge extension added fills beyond borders when conditions met, helping complete shapes in training without overfilling.
 * is_border and is_border_col functions are broken or unhelpful: they redundantly check g[r][c] == 3 for all directions without position-specific logic (e.g., right border should check end of group), leading to potential false negatives in gap/edge checks—do not reuse without fixing.
 * has_one/has_one_col and has_two/has_two_col are simple but helpful for checking clues or existing fills in groups, worked in training.
 * Overall loop ensured convergence, which was key to training success, but may loop inefficiently if changes oscillate (not seen in training).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one shows partial understanding: core filling rules work for simple cases but may miss complex interactions like non-stem vertical fills or edge cases without borders.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a large 27x27 grid (inferred from row lengths) with patterns of 2s forming irregular shapes: a central vertical stem of 2s in column 5 (index 5, all rows filled with 2), horizontal extensions in upper rows (e.g., rows 3-5 have 2s in cols 2-6), a blob-like fill in rows 5-7 cols 0-19, scattered 2s in right side (e.g., cols 16-18 in many rows), and isolated vertical 2s in lower rows col 5.
 * The output makes sense as a plausible filling: it copied seeds, filled a stem vertically, propagated horizontally/vertically via gaps/flood, and extended edges, creating connected regions without filling everything (many 8s remain, respecting walls).
 * However, without the test input grid, it's impossible to verify exact correctness, but the patterns look consistent with rules (e.g., no filling into pure 8s, 2s cluster around presumed seeds/clues); subtle issue: right-side 2s in cols 16-18 appear in most rows but taper off, suggesting vertical gap filling worked, but lower rows (18+) have only stem 2s, possibly missing horizontal extensions if input had clues there.
 * Potential mismatch: if test input has disconnected regions without borders/clues, the output correctly leaves them as 8s; but the isolated 2s in rows 0-2 cols 16-17 suggest early seed copying or flood, which seems appropriate.
 * Overall, the test output looks correct and demonstrates the program's rules applied iteratively, with no obvious over/under-filling anomalies.
