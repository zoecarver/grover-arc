=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 22:57:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:09:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
This correctly identifies the background color from top-left.

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

[2025-09-30 23:09:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.

 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
This correctly identifies the background color from top-left.

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Training example 1 result: ERROR - Execution error: object of type 'int' has no len()

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Execution error: object of type 'int' has no len()

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: object of type 'int' has no len()
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-09-30 23:29:49] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
This correctly identifies the background color from top-left.

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:38:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Basic and correct for determining background.

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                size = 0
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size += 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, size))
    return components
```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

[2025-09-30 23:39:06] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and corresponding outputs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train puzzle (both train 1 and train 2, across inputs and outputs). I focused only on components with clear, repeated interactions (e.g., relative positioning, co-movement, or structural embedding) that are present and behave similarly in both examples. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated small accents without clear ties, variable hole counts not tied to specific interactions, or one-off positions) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided—only direct, observable connections are noted. Where a full transformation mechanism cannot be explained from the data (e.g., exact positioning rules), it is flagged as unknown.

1. **Small Red (pixels=1, holes=0) embedded inside larger Green or Blue block (holes=1, pixels=7-8)**:
   - The small Red is consistently positioned at the approximate center of the larger Green/Blue block's bounding box (e.g., in train 1 input: Red at [14,8] inside Green [13,7,15,9]; in train 2 input: Red at [2,4] inside Blue [1,3,3,5]).
   - Interaction: The small Red moves together with the larger block to a new position, preserving relative internal placement (e.g., in train 1 output: Red at [10,2] inside Green [9,1,11,3]; in train 2 output: Red at [1,2] inside Blue [0,1,2,3]).
   - Effect: The embedding affects co-transformation of position; the pair relocates as a unit without separation.

2. **Small Yellow (pixels=1-2, holes=0) embedded inside larger Blue block (holes=0 or 1, pixels=5-18)**:
   - The small Yellow is consistently positioned within or adjacent to the interior of the larger Blue block's bounding box (e.g., in train 1 input: Yellow at [6,8] or [22,13] inside Blue [6,7,9,9] or [21,12,22,14]; in train 2 input: Yellow at [11,3,12,3] or [14,3,15,3] inside Blue [11,1,16,5]).
   - Interaction: The small Yellow moves together with the larger Blue block, maintaining relative internal or edge-adjacent placement (e.g., in train 1 output: Yellow at [2,2] inside Blue [1,1,5,3]; in train 2 output: Yellow at [16,2,17,2] or [19,2,20,2] inside Blue [16,0,21,4]).
   - Effect: The embedding influences co-movement; the Yellow's position relative to the Blue's edges or center is preserved during relocation.

3. **Pink rectangular block (pixels=5 or 12, holes=0, rectangular bbox)** connected to edge or border positions:
   - Pink appears as a consistent vertical or near-vertical rectangle (e.g., in train 1 input: [20,11,20,15] pixels=5; in train 2 input: [3,23,6,27] pixels=12).
   - Interaction: Pink relocates to a new border or edge position (often left or right side), with size and shape preserved but orientation potentially shifting (e.g., in train 1 output: [0,0,0,4] pixels=5 at left edge; in train 2 output: [11,0,14,4] pixels=12 near top edge).
   - Effect: Position transformation ties Pink to boundary interactions; it consistently interacts with the overall canvas edges by moving toward them, but exact relocation rule is unknown.

4. **Small alternating color pairs (e.g., Maroon/Light Blue or Orange/Green; pixels=1, holes=0) in adjacent positions**:
   - Pairs of small single-pixel blocks alternate colors and are placed immediately adjacent (e.g., in train 1 input/output: Maroon at [1,0] adjacent to Light Blue at [2,0]; in train 2 input: Orange at [15,15] adjacent to Green at [16,15]; similar clusters at bottoms/tops).
   - Interaction: The alternating pairs or small clusters move together to new adjacent positions, preserving color alternation and relative spacing (e.g., in train 1 output: Maroon [1,4] adjacent to Light Blue [2,4]; in train 2 output: Orange [10,1] adjacent to Green [11,1], with similar clusters at y=1-3).
   - Effect: Adjacency affects group movement; pairs relocate as connected units (often vertically shifting), maintaining pattern integrity.

5. **Large holed area (high pixels=415-513, multiple holes=3-6, spanning bbox) of dominant color (Maroon or Yellow) interacts with horizontal strip formation**:
   - A single large block dominates the canvas with multiple holes (e.g., in train 1 input: Maroon [0,0,24,22] holes=3 pixels=527; in train 2 input: Yellow [0,0,19,29] holes=4 pixels=513).
   - Interaction: The large block decomposes into multiple smaller horizontal strips of the same color (e.g., in train 1 output: Maroon strips like [3,0,11,1] pixels=12 and [3,3,11,4] pixels=12; in train 2 output: Yellow strips like [0,0,10,1] pixels=18 and [0,3,10,4] pixels=18).
   - Effect: Hole count and spanning position influence breakdown into linear horizontal components of consistent length (pixels=12-18 per strip); exact decomposition rule (e.g., how holes affect strip count or gaps) is unknown, but the color and horizontal orientation are preserved consistently.

No other connections (e.g., involving all Green accents, all Light Blue extensions, or Dark Red specifics) were consistently interactive across both train examples—many appear isolated or variable without clear ties to movement or transformation in every case. Test inputs show similar components (e.g., embedded small Reds/Yellows in Blues/Greens, large holed Green in test 1, Pink relocations), but no outputs are provided to verify consistency beyond trains.

[2025-09-30 23:40:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
This correctly identifies the background color from top-left.

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Basic and correct for determining background.

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                size = 0
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size += 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, size))
    return components
```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and corresponding outputs), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train puzzle (both train 1 and train 2, across inputs and outputs). I focused only on components with clear, repeated interactions (e.g., relative positioning, co-movement, or structural embedding) that are present and behave similarly in both examples. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated small accents without clear ties, variable hole counts not tied to specific interactions, or one-off positions) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided—only direct, observable connections are noted. Where a full transformation mechanism cannot be explained from the data (e.g., exact positioning rules), it is flagged as unknown.

1. **Small Red (pixels=1, holes=0) embedded inside larger Green or Blue block (holes=1, pixels=7-8)**:
   - The small Red is consistently positioned at the approximate center of the larger Green/Blue block's bounding box (e.g., in train 1 input: Red at [14,8] inside Green [13,7,15,9]; in train 2 input: Red at [2,4] inside Blue [1,3,3,5]).
   - Interaction: The small Red moves together with the larger block to a new position, preserving relative internal placement (e.g., in train 1 output: Red at [10,2] inside Green [9,1,11,3]; in train 2 output: Red at [1,2] inside Blue [0,1,2,3]).
   - Effect: The embedding affects co-transformation of position; the pair relocates as a unit without separation.

2. **Small Yellow (pixels=1-2, holes=0) embedded inside larger Blue block (holes=0 or 1, pixels=5-18)**:
   - The small Yellow is consistently positioned within or adjacent to the interior of the larger Blue block's bounding box (e.g., in train 1 input: Yellow at [6,8] or [22,13] inside Blue [6,7,9,9] or [21,12,22,14]; in train 2 input: Yellow at [11,3,12,3] or [14,3,15,3] inside Blue [11,1,16,5]).
   - Interaction: The small Yellow moves together with the larger Blue block, maintaining relative internal or edge-adjacent placement (e.g., in train 1 output: Yellow at [2,2] inside Blue [1,1,5,3]; in train 2 output: Yellow at [16,2,17,2] or [19,2,20,2] inside Blue [16,0,21,4]).
   - Effect: The embedding influences co-movement; the Yellow's position relative to the Blue's edges or center is preserved during relocation.

3. **Pink rectangular block (pixels=5 or 12, holes=0, rectangular bbox)** connected to edge or border positions:
   - Pink appears as a consistent vertical or near-vertical rectangle (e.g., in train 1 input: [20,11,20,15] pixels=5; in train 2 input: [3,23,6,27] pixels=12).
   - Interaction: Pink relocates to a new border or edge position (often left or right side), with size and shape preserved but orientation potentially shifting (e.g., in train 1 output: [0,0,0,4] pixels=5 at left edge; in train 2 output: [11,0,14,4] pixels=12 near top edge).
   - Effect: Position transformation ties Pink to boundary interactions; it consistently interacts with the overall canvas edges by moving toward them, but exact relocation rule is unknown.

4. **Small alternating color pairs (e.g., Maroon/Light Blue or Orange/Green; pixels=1, holes=0) in adjacent positions**:
   - Pairs of small single-pixel blocks alternate colors and are placed immediately adjacent (e.g., in train 1 input/output: Maroon at [1,0] adjacent to Light Blue at [2,0]; in train 2 input: Orange at [15,15] adjacent to Green at [16,15]; similar clusters at bottoms/tops).
   - Interaction: The alternating pairs or small clusters move together to new adjacent positions, preserving color alternation and relative spacing (e.g., in train 1 output: Maroon [1,4] adjacent to Light Blue [2,4]; in train 2 output: Orange [10,1] adjacent to Green [11,1], with similar clusters at y=1-3).
   - Effect: Adjacency affects group movement; pairs relocate as connected units (often vertically shifting), maintaining pattern integrity.

5. **Large holed area (high pixels=415-513, multiple holes=3-6, spanning bbox) of dominant color (Maroon or Yellow) interacts with horizontal strip formation**:
   - A single large block dominates the canvas with multiple holes (e.g., in train 1 input: Maroon [0,0,24,22] holes=3 pixels=527; in train 2 input: Yellow [0,0,19,29] holes=4 pixels=513).
   - Interaction: The large block decomposes into multiple smaller horizontal strips of the same color (e.g., in train 1 output: Maroon strips like [3,0,11,1] pixels=12 and [3,3,11,4] pixels=12; in train 2 output: Yellow strips like [0,0,10,1] pixels=18 and [0,3,10,4] pixels=18).
   - Effect: Hole count and spanning position influence breakdown into linear horizontal components of consistent length (pixels=12-18 per strip); exact decomposition rule (e.g., how holes affect strip count or gaps) is unknown, but the color and horizontal orientation are preserved consistently.

No other connections (e.g., involving all Green accents, all Light Blue extensions, or Dark Red specifics) were consistently interactive across both train examples—many appear isolated or variable without clear ties to movement or transformation in every case. Test inputs show similar components (e.g., embedded small Reds/Yellows in Blues/Greens, large holed Green in test 1, Pink relocations), but no outputs are provided to verify consistency beyond trains.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:49:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing a scene with a background color and various connected "objects" (blobs of non-background pixels), and the goal is to extract, process, and rearrange these objects into a standardized 5-row output grid by identifying valid components, normalizing their height and trimming, sorting them by horizontal position, and concatenating them side-by-side on a background, effectively creating a "gallery" or "sequence" of processed objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left pixel value; all processing treats non-bg connected pixels (4-directional adjacency) as part of objects.
 * Only include components that are short (height <=5) and have at least 2 pixels (size >=2); taller or single-pixel components are ignored to filter out irrelevant elements like bars or noise.
 * Extraction: Subgrids are pulled directly from the bounding box of each component, with out-of-bounds treated as bg.
 * Processing subtleties: Subgrids must be padded vertically to exactly 5 rows (centered if possible), and horizontally trimmed to remove leading/trailing all-bg columns (but keep at least the core if not empty); however, arbitrary filling (e.g., setting inner bg to 1 if 9 is present) alters pixel values incorrectly and should be avoided—pixels should remain as-is unless padding.
 * Sorting: Components are sorted primarily by leftmost column (min_c), secondarily by top row (min_r) to maintain left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order in the output.
 * Output construction: All processed subgrids are concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid, with bg filling any gaps; if no components, output a single bg cell; total width is the sum of trimmed subgrid widths.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components may overlap or be adjacent but are treated separately if not connected; bg can appear inside objects (holes), but the code doesn't fill them—potential need to detect/fill holes or preserve them; 9 might indicate special cases (e.g., "filled" or "target" objects), but forcing changes based on it breaks fidelity; ensure no vertical padding affects width; handle empty processed subgrids by skipping them.
 * Across attempts (this is the first): No rotation, scaling, or value remapping beyond padding/trimming; output must exactly match expected pixel values and dimensions, including bg placement; test cases may have asymmetric padding or irregular shapes that trimming must handle precisely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background from top-left, assuming consistent bg.)

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size = 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding box and filtering is solid and essential for identifying objects; uses stack for efficiency.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = [g[r][c] if 0 <= c < len(g[0]) else bg for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(This bounding box extraction is helpful and preserves original values, handling edges correctly.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Simple tuple key for sorting components left-to-right then top-to-bottom; useful for output order.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg, finds connected components with proper filtering (height <=5, size >=2), extracts bounding subgrids without alteration, pads vertically to 5 rows (centered), trims horizontal bg columns, sorts by position, and concatenates into a 5-row output—basic structure works for arrangement.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated a 5x16 grid with misplaced values (e.g., 9s and 6s in wrong positions, extra columns from untrimmed or wrong components, inner rows have altered 1s/2s/3s/4s that don't match expected 5x12 with specific 6/1/4/2/3/8/9 placements); likely due to including extraneous components or poor trimming, resulting in wider output and value mismatches (e.g., expected starts with [6,8,9,...] but generated has [8,8,8,9,...]).
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x29 grid (too wide) with jumbled values (e.g., long stretches of 4s and misplaced 1/2/3/5/6/8), while expected is 5x22 with cleaner separation of components (e.g., expected has grouped 4s then 6s then objects); suggests over-inclusion of bg-adjacent pixels or failure to trim properly, plus possible asymmetric component extraction.
 * The process_subgrid function's contains_9 check and forced setting of inner bg to 1 is broken/unhelpful—it arbitrarily changes pixels (e.g., filling "holes" incorrectly), leading to value alterations not seen in expecteds; don't use this logic, as it introduces 1s where none should be and ignores true object shapes.
 * Overall, attempt shows good skeleton for component detection and layout but fails on fidelity (wrong widths, values) due to incorrect processing; no handling for holes or special values like 9 beyond bad filling; trimming works partially but not enough to match dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with values like clustered 1/3/4/6/8 and a 2/7 in row 3, but it does not look correct—width (16) mismatches training expecteds' patterns (e.g., train1=12, train2=22), and values seem disorganized (e.g., row 0 has 4s/6s/1s/3s/2s but no clear object separation; row 2 has a lone 7 which may be an artifact or unfiltered single-pixel); likely includes invalid components or poor trimming, as expecteds have tight, symmetric objects without outliers like 7.
 * Compared to training, it over-arranges (extra columns) and alters placements (e.g., 8s scattered vs. expected blocks); doesn't make sense as a "gallery" since shapes blend (e.g., row 4 has long 1/3/6 run without bg separation); to fix, ensure stricter component validation and no value changes to match expected clean outputs.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 23:50:18] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections between elements are consistent across **both** examples. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships (e.g., positional containment within bounding boxes, adjacency based on overlapping or touching bboxes, or property linkages like size/pixels influencing positioning) that appear in every train pair. Only elements with verifiable interactions are included; no assumptions about semantic meaning, full transformations, or unlisted properties are made. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated small singles without containment/adjacency) are excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., Green-Red containment, which occurs only in train 1) are omitted. Unknowns (e.g., why certain pixel counts change slightly despite containment) are noted explicitly.

#### 1. **Blue Blocks and Yellow Small Squares (Positional Containment Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Small Yellow blocks (holes=0, pixels=1-2, small bbox like 1x1 or 2x1) are consistently positioned inside the bounding box of a larger Blue block (holes=0 or 1, pixels=7-18, larger bbox spanning 3-6 units in at least one dimension). This containment is direct (Yellow bbox fully within Blue bbox) and affects the Blue's effective structure (e.g., Yellow occupies internal space, potentially contributing to Blue's pixel count or hole properties, though exact pixel addition is unknown—e.g., input Blue pixels=7-18 with internal Yellow p=1-2, output similar but pixels=10-18).
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 Input: Yellow [6,8,6,8] p=1 inside Blue [6,7,9,9] p=7 h=0; another Yellow [22,13,22,13] p=1 inside Blue [21,12,22,14] p=5 h=0.
     - Train 1 Output: Yellow [2,2,2,2] p=1 inside Blue [1,1,5,3] p=10 h=1.
     - Train 2 Input: Yellow [11,3,12,3] p=2 and [14,3,15,3] p=2 inside Blue [11,1,16,5] p=18 h=1; no additional Yellow-Blue in small Blue [1,3,3,5] p=8 h=1.
     - Train 2 Output: Yellow [16,2,17,2] p=2 and [19,2,20,2] p=2 inside Blue [16,0,21,4] p=18 h=1; small Blue [0,1,2,3] p=8 h=1 has no internal Yellow.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Position (Yellow inside Blue bbox) → Blue's hole count (h=0 or 1) and pixels (increased by Yellow's presence, but exact mechanism unknown—e.g., no direct pixel sum, as output Blue p=10 > input p=7+1).
     - Yellow size (small, p=1-2) → restricts to internal placement within Blue; no Yellows outside Blues in these interactions.
   - **Notes**: This is the most consistent interaction; it persists through rearrangement (scattered in input → clustered in output middle rows y=1-3). Light Blue small squares sometimes adjacent to Blues (e.g., train 1 input [6,6,6,6] adjacent above Blue [6,7,9,9]), but adjacency is not containment and inconsistent (absent in train 2), so excluded.

#### 2. **Blue Blocks and Red Small Squares (Positional Containment or Direct Adjacency Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Small Red blocks (holes=0, pixels=1, 1x1 bbox) are consistently either inside or directly adjacent (touching bbox edges, no gap) to Blue blocks (as above, p=7-18, h=0-1). This affects Blue's internal structure or extension (e.g., Red acts as an internal accent or edge modifier, potentially influencing Blue's bbox expansion or pixels, though change is unknown—e.g., input Blue p=8 with internal Red p=1 → output p=8).
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 Input: Red [14,8,14,8] p=1 adjacent/right of Blue [6,7,9,9] p=7 (bboxes touch at x=9-10, y=7-9 overlap); no direct internal Red in this Blue, but pattern holds via adjacency. (Note: This Red is also near Green, but Blue adjacency is primary here.)
     - Train 1 Output: No small Red inside the main Blue [1,1,5,3] p=10, but Red [6,1,8,3] p=7 is adjacent/right (bboxes touch at x=5-6, y=1-3).
     - Train 2 Input: Red [2,4,2,4] p=1 inside Blue [1,3,3,5] p=8 h=1; Red [6,16,6,16] p=1 adjacent/left of Blue [11,1,16,5] p=18 (bboxes touch at x=6-11? Wait, x=6 to x=11 gap, but y=16 overlaps Blue's y=1-5? No, y=16 outside Blue y=1-5—wait, recheck: Blue y=1-5, Red y=16, no overlap. Actually, only the left small Blue has internal Red; large Blue has no Red interaction. But pattern holds via the contained example.)
     - Train 2 Output: Red [1,2,1,2] p=1 inside Blue [0,1,2,3] p=8 h=1; no Red in large Blue [16,0,21,4].
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Position (Red inside or touching Blue bbox) → Blue's bbox dimensions (Red extends or fills edge, e.g., input small Blue width=3 with internal Red at center → output width=3).
     - Red size (p=1, holes=0) → limited to small accents; larger Reds (e.g., p=5-7) are adjacent but not contained (inconsistent for large Reds across trains, so excluded).
   - **Notes**: Containment is stronger in train 2 (internal), adjacency in train 1, but both show spatial linkage. This interaction does not always change Blue holes (h=1 preserved in contained cases, unknown why). Larger Red bars (p=5-7) sometimes adjacent to Blues but not consistently contained (e.g., train 1 has p=7 Red next to Blue, train 2 lacks large Red near Blue), so only small Reds included.

#### 3. **Background Large Block and Horizontal Frame Components (Color and Size Transformation Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The large background block (high pixels=513-527, multiple holes=3-4, full-canvas bbox like 19-24 x 22-30) consistently provides its color and size properties to form multiple horizontal rectangular components in the output (p=12-18, holes=0, thin bboxes like width=10-11 height=2 at fixed y-positions 0-1 and 3-4). This is a property transfer (background fills → split into bars), affecting output layout (horizontals frame the canvas).
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 Input: Maroon h=3 p=527 bbox=[0,0,24,22] → Output Maroon bars [3,0,11,1] p=12 h=0 and [3,3,11,4] p=12 h=0 (color match, total output Maroon p~25, derived from input large size).
     - Train 2 Input: Yellow h=4 p=513 bbox=[0,0,19,29] → Output Yellow bars [0,0,10,1] p=18 h=0, [0,3,10,4] p=18 h=0, [14,0,17,0] p=4 h=0, [14,4,17,4] p=4 h=0 (color match, total output Yellow p~44, derived from input large size; shorter bars on right).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Background color → output horizontal color (direct match: Maroon → Maroon bars, Yellow → Yellow bars).
     - Background size/pixels (large, 513-527) and holes (3-4) → split into multiple smaller horizontals (total output pixels subset of input, holes=0 in output—unknown why holes are eliminated; positions fixed to y=0-1/3-4, affecting overall frame transformation).
   - **Notes**: No internal components listed within the background block, so interaction is purely property-based (color/size → new components). This is consistent but high-level; no other colors (e.g., Pink) show similar splitting.

#### 4. **Pink Vertical Blocks and Frame Positioning (Standalone Positional Effect, with Implicit Frame Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Pink blocks (holes=0, pixels=5-12, tall/narrow bbox like 1x3 to 3x5 vertical) are consistently repositioned as vertical frame elements without internal containments, but their position affects adjacent components (e.g., next to background-derived horizontals or Blues, enforcing horizontal alignment). No direct containment, but bbox touches horizontals in output.
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 Input: Pink [20,11,20,15] p=5 h=0 (vertical).
     - Train 1 Output: Pink [0,0,0,4] p=5 h=0 (vertical, touches Maroon horizontals at y=0/4).
     - Train 2 Input: Pink [3,23,6,27] p=12 h=0 (vertical, wider); small Pinks p=1 but standalone, not interacting.
     - Train 2 Output: Pink [11,0,14,4] p=12 h=0 (vertical, touches Yellow horizontals at y=0/4, adjacent to Maroon [15,1-15,3] and Blue [16,0-21,4]).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Pink size (p=5-12, vertical bbox) → output position (fixed height=4-5, placed at canvas edges x=0 or mid-right, affecting adjacency to background horizontals).
     - Position (vertical orientation) → frame enforcement (touches top/bottom horizontals, unknown if this modifies horizontal pixels—e.g., no pixel change observed).
   - **Notes**: Small Pinks (p=1) in train 2 input are isolated (no bbox overlap), so excluded as irrelevant/non-interacting. This is more positional effect than direct component interaction, but consistent with frame elements.

#### Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Pixel/Hole Changes in Contained Structures**: Why Blue pixels increase slightly (e.g., train 1 input p=7+1 Yellow → output p=10) or holes appear (h=0 → h=1) despite containment is unknown; no consistent rule identifiable without forcing an explanation.
- **Maroon Small Verticals**: Appear in train 2 (p=3 vertical, preserved in output adjacent to Pink), but absent in train 1, so inconsistent.
- **Green Small Blocks**: Often adjacent to Blues or in lines (e.g., p=2 h=0 next to Yellow), but no direct containment or property effect consistent across both trains (e.g., no uniform inside/outside pattern).
- **Orange/Green Alternating**: Present only in train 2 (small p=1 adjacent in checker pattern, placed in output horizontals), inconsistent.
- **Light Blue Small Squares**: Adjacent to Blues or Pinks in train 1 only, no containment or effect in train 2, excluded.
- **Dark Red in Tests**: Not in trains, so no consistency check; potential Red variant, but unknown interaction.
- No color-to-color changes (e.g., position → color) observed consistently; all preserved within interactions.
- No edge/silhouette effects identifiable (e.g., no consistent bbox edge touching transforming shapes).
- Test inputs show similar patterns (e.g., test 1 has Yellow [1,10,3,12] p=5 near Blue [1,13,3,14] p=5, potential containment; test 2 has Yellow h=1 p=8 inside possible Red/Maroon), but not used for consistency as per instructions.

This list captures only obvious, every-example-consistent interactions; no broader puzzle logic inferred.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 23:51:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing a scene with a background color and various connected "objects" (blobs of non-background pixels), and the goal is to extract, process, and rearrange these objects into a standardized 5-row output grid by identifying valid components, normalizing their height and trimming, sorting them by horizontal position, and concatenating them side-by-side on a background, effectively creating a "gallery" or "sequence" of processed objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left pixel value; all processing treats non-bg connected pixels (4-directional adjacency) as part of objects.
 * Only include components that are short (height <=5) and have at least 2 pixels (size >=2); taller or single-pixel components are ignored to filter out irrelevant elements like bars or noise.
 * Extraction: Subgrids are pulled directly from the bounding box of each component, with out-of-bounds treated as bg.
 * Processing subtleties: Subgrids must be padded vertically to exactly 5 rows (centered if possible), and horizontally trimmed to remove leading/trailing all-bg columns (but keep at least the core if not empty); however, arbitrary filling (e.g., setting inner bg to 1 if 9 is present) alters pixel values incorrectly and should be avoided—pixels should remain as-is unless padding.
 * Sorting: Components are sorted primarily by leftmost column (min_c), secondarily by top row (min_r) to maintain left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order in the output.
 * Output construction: All processed subgrids are concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid, with bg filling any gaps; if no components, output a single bg cell; total width is the sum of trimmed subgrid widths.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components may overlap or be adjacent but are treated separately if not connected; bg can appear inside objects (holes), but the code doesn't fill them—potential need to detect/fill holes or preserve them; 9 might indicate special cases (e.g., "filled" or "target" objects), but forcing changes based on it breaks fidelity; ensure no vertical padding affects width; handle empty processed subgrids by skipping them.
 * Across attempts (this is the first): No rotation, scaling, or value remapping beyond padding/trimming; output must exactly match expected pixel values and dimensions, including bg placement; test cases may have asymmetric padding or irregular shapes that trimming must handle precisely.

    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding box and filtering is solid and essential for identifying objects; uses stack for efficiency.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1

        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(This bounding box extraction is helpful and preserves original values, handling edges correctly.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Simple tuple key for sorting components left-to-right then top-to-bottom; useful for output order.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg, finds connected components with proper filtering (height <=5, size >=2), extracts bounding subgrids without alteration, pads vertically to 5 rows (centered), trims horizontal bg columns, sorts by position, and concatenates into a 5-row output—basic structure works for arrangement.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated a 5x16 grid with misplaced values (e.g., 9s and 6s in wrong positions, extra columns from untrimmed or wrong components, inner rows have altered 1s/2s/3s/4s that don't match expected 5x12 with specific 6/1/4/2/3/8/9 placements); likely due to including extraneous components or poor trimming, resulting in wider output and value mismatches (e.g., expected starts with [6,8,9,...] but generated has [8,8,8,9,...]).
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x29 grid (too wide) with jumbled values (e.g., long stretches of 4s and misplaced 1/2/3/5/6/8), while expected is 5x22 with cleaner separation of components (e.g., expected has grouped 4s then 6s then objects); suggests over-inclusion of bg-adjacent pixels or failure to trim properly, plus possible asymmetric component extraction.
 * The process_subgrid function's contains_9 check and forced setting of inner bg to 1 is broken/unhelpful—it arbitrarily changes pixels (e.g., filling "holes" incorrectly), leading to value alterations not seen in expecteds; don't use this logic, as it introduces 1s where none should be and ignores true object shapes.
 * Overall, attempt shows good skeleton for component detection and layout but fails on fidelity (wrong widths, values) due to incorrect processing; no handling for holes or special values like 9 beyond bad filling; trimming works partially but not enough to match dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with values like clustered 1/3/4/6/8 and a 2/7 in row 3, but it does not look correct—width (16) mismatches training expecteds' patterns (e.g., train1=12, train2=22), and values seem disorganized (e.g., row 0 has 4s/6s/1s/3s/2s but no clear object separation; row 2 has a lone 7 which may be an artifact or unfiltered single-pixel); likely includes invalid components or poor trimming, as expecteds have tight, symmetric objects without outliers like 7.
 * Compared to training, it over-arranges (extra columns) and alters placements (e.g., 8s scattered vs. expected blocks); doesn't make sense as a "gallery" since shapes blend (e.g., row 4 has long 1/3/6 run without bg separation); to fix, ensure stricter component validation and no value changes to match expected clean outputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
This correctly identifies the background color from top-left.

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]

Basic and correct for determining background.

            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                size = 0

                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, size))
    return components
```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections between elements are consistent across **both** examples. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships (e.g., positional containment within bounding boxes, adjacency based on overlapping or touching bboxes, or property linkages like size/pixels influencing positioning) that appear in every train pair. Only elements with verifiable interactions are included; no assumptions about semantic meaning, full transformations, or unlisted properties are made. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated small singles without containment/adjacency) are excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., Green-Red containment, which occurs only in train 1) are omitted. Unknowns (e.g., why certain pixel counts change slightly despite containment) are noted explicitly.

#### 1. **Blue Blocks and Yellow Small Squares (Positional Containment Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Small Yellow blocks (holes=0, pixels=1-2, small bbox like 1x1 or 2x1) are consistently positioned inside the bounding box of a larger Blue block (holes=0 or 1, pixels=7-18, larger bbox spanning 3-6 units in at least one dimension). This containment is direct (Yellow bbox fully within Blue bbox) and affects the Blue's effective structure (e.g., Yellow occupies internal space, potentially contributing to Blue's pixel count or hole properties, though exact pixel addition is unknown—e.g., input Blue pixels=7-18 with internal Yellow p=1-2, output similar but pixels=10-18).
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 Input: Yellow [6,8,6,8] p=1 inside Blue [6,7,9,9] p=7 h=0; another Yellow [22,13,22,13] p=1 inside Blue [21,12,22,14] p=5 h=0.
     - Train 1 Output: Yellow [2,2,2,2] p=1 inside Blue [1,1,5,3] p=10 h=1.
     - Train 2 Input: Yellow [11,3,12,3] p=2 and [14,3,15,3] p=2 inside Blue [11,1,16,5] p=18 h=1; no additional Yellow-Blue in small Blue [1,3,3,5] p=8 h=1.
     - Train 2 Output: Yellow [16,2,17,2] p=2 and [19,2,20,2] p=2 inside Blue [16,0,21,4] p=18 h=1; small Blue [0,1,2,3] p=8 h=1 has no internal Yellow.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Position (Yellow inside Blue bbox) → Blue's hole count (h=0 or 1) and pixels (increased by Yellow's presence, but exact mechanism unknown—e.g., no direct pixel sum, as output Blue p=10 > input p=7+1).
     - Yellow size (small, p=1-2) → restricts to internal placement within Blue; no Yellows outside Blues in these interactions.
   - **Notes**: This is the most consistent interaction; it persists through rearrangement (scattered in input → clustered in output middle rows y=1-3). Light Blue small squares sometimes adjacent to Blues (e.g., train 1 input [6,6,6,6] adjacent above Blue [6,7,9,9]), but adjacency is not containment and inconsistent (absent in train 2), so excluded.

#### 2. **Blue Blocks and Red Small Squares (Positional Containment or Direct Adjacency Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Small Red blocks (holes=0, pixels=1, 1x1 bbox) are consistently either inside or directly adjacent (touching bbox edges, no gap) to Blue blocks (as above, p=7-18, h=0-1). This affects Blue's internal structure or extension (e.g., Red acts as an internal accent or edge modifier, potentially influencing Blue's bbox expansion or pixels, though change is unknown—e.g., input Blue p=8 with internal Red p=1 → output p=8).
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 Input: Red [14,8,14,8] p=1 adjacent/right of Blue [6,7,9,9] p=7 (bboxes touch at x=9-10, y=7-9 overlap); no direct internal Red in this Blue, but pattern holds via adjacency. (Note: This Red is also near Green, but Blue adjacency is primary here.)
     - Train 1 Output: No small Red inside the main Blue [1,1,5,3] p=10, but Red [6,1,8,3] p=7 is adjacent/right (bboxes touch at x=5-6, y=1-3).
     - Train 2 Input: Red [2,4,2,4] p=1 inside Blue [1,3,3,5] p=8 h=1; Red [6,16,6,16] p=1 adjacent/left of Blue [11,1,16,5] p=18 (bboxes touch at x=6-11? Wait, x=6 to x=11 gap, but y=16 overlaps Blue's y=1-5? No, y=16 outside Blue y=1-5—wait, recheck: Blue y=1-5, Red y=16, no overlap. Actually, only the left small Blue has internal Red; large Blue has no Red interaction. But pattern holds via the contained example.)
     - Train 2 Output: Red [1,2,1,2] p=1 inside Blue [0,1,2,3] p=8 h=1; no Red in large Blue [16,0,21,4].
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Position (Red inside or touching Blue bbox) → Blue's bbox dimensions (Red extends or fills edge, e.g., input small Blue width=3 with internal Red at center → output width=3).
     - Red size (p=1, holes=0) → limited to small accents; larger Reds (e.g., p=5-7) are adjacent but not contained (inconsistent for large Reds across trains, so excluded).
   - **Notes**: Containment is stronger in train 2 (internal), adjacency in train 1, but both show spatial linkage. This interaction does not always change Blue holes (h=1 preserved in contained cases, unknown why). Larger Red bars (p=5-7) sometimes adjacent to Blues but not consistently contained (e.g., train 1 has p=7 Red next to Blue, train 2 lacks large Red near Blue), so only small Reds included.

#### 3. **Background Large Block and Horizontal Frame Components (Color and Size Transformation Interaction)**
   - **Description**: The large background block (high pixels=513-527, multiple holes=3-4, full-canvas bbox like 19-24 x 22-30) consistently provides its color and size properties to form multiple horizontal rectangular components in the output (p=12-18, holes=0, thin bboxes like width=10-11 height=2 at fixed y-positions 0-1 and 3-4). This is a property transfer (background fills → split into bars), affecting output layout (horizontals frame the canvas).
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 Input: Maroon h=3 p=527 bbox=[0,0,24,22] → Output Maroon bars [3,0,11,1] p=12 h=0 and [3,3,11,4] p=12 h=0 (color match, total output Maroon p~25, derived from input large size).
     - Train 2 Input: Yellow h=4 p=513 bbox=[0,0,19,29] → Output Yellow bars [0,0,10,1] p=18 h=0, [0,3,10,4] p=18 h=0, [14,0,17,0] p=4 h=0, [14,4,17,4] p=4 h=0 (color match, total output Yellow p~44, derived from input large size; shorter bars on right).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Background color → output horizontal color (direct match: Maroon → Maroon bars, Yellow → Yellow bars).
     - Background size/pixels (large, 513-527) and holes (3-4) → split into multiple smaller horizontals (total output pixels subset of input, holes=0 in output—unknown why holes are eliminated; positions fixed to y=0-1/3-4, affecting overall frame transformation).
   - **Notes**: No internal components listed within the background block, so interaction is purely property-based (color/size → new components). This is consistent but high-level; no other colors (e.g., Pink) show similar splitting.

#### 4. **Pink Vertical Blocks and Frame Positioning (Standalone Positional Effect, with Implicit Frame Interaction)**
   - **Description**: Pink blocks (holes=0, pixels=5-12, tall/narrow bbox like 1x3 to 3x5 vertical) are consistently repositioned as vertical frame elements without internal containments, but their position affects adjacent components (e.g., next to background-derived horizontals or Blues, enforcing horizontal alignment). No direct containment, but bbox touches horizontals in output.
   - **Consistency Across Trains**:
     - Train 1 Input: Pink [20,11,20,15] p=5 h=0 (vertical).
     - Train 1 Output: Pink [0,0,0,4] p=5 h=0 (vertical, touches Maroon horizontals at y=0/4).
     - Train 2 Input: Pink [3,23,6,27] p=12 h=0 (vertical, wider); small Pinks p=1 but standalone, not interacting.
     - Train 2 Output: Pink [11,0,14,4] p=12 h=0 (vertical, touches Yellow horizontals at y=0/4, adjacent to Maroon [15,1-15,3] and Blue [16,0-21,4]).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Pink size (p=5-12, vertical bbox) → output position (fixed height=4-5, placed at canvas edges x=0 or mid-right, affecting adjacency to background horizontals).
     - Position (vertical orientation) → frame enforcement (touches top/bottom horizontals, unknown if this modifies horizontal pixels—e.g., no pixel change observed).
   - **Notes**: Small Pinks (p=1) in train 2 input are isolated (no bbox overlap), so excluded as irrelevant/non-interacting. This is more positional effect than direct component interaction, but consistent with frame elements.

#### Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Pixel/Hole Changes in Contained Structures**: Why Blue pixels increase slightly (e.g., train 1 input p=7+1 Yellow → output p=10) or holes appear (h=0 → h=1) despite containment is unknown; no consistent rule identifiable without forcing an explanation.
- **Maroon Small Verticals**: Appear in train 2 (p=3 vertical, preserved in output adjacent to Pink), but absent in train 1, so inconsistent.
- **Green Small Blocks**: Often adjacent to Blues or in lines (e.g., p=2 h=0 next to Yellow), but no direct containment or property effect consistent across both trains (e.g., no uniform inside/outside pattern).
- **Orange/Green Alternating**: Present only in train 2 (small p=1 adjacent in checker pattern, placed in output horizontals), inconsistent.
- **Light Blue Small Squares**: Adjacent to Blues or Pinks in train 1 only, no containment or effect in train 2, excluded.
- **Dark Red in Tests**: Not in trains, so no consistency check; potential Red variant, but unknown interaction.
- No color-to-color changes (e.g., position → color) observed consistently; all preserved within interactions.
- No edge/silhouette effects identifiable (e.g., no consistent bbox edge touching transforming shapes).
- Test inputs show similar patterns (e.g., test 1 has Yellow [1,10,3,12] p=5 near Blue [1,13,3,14] p=5, potential containment; test 2 has Yellow h=1 p=8 inside possible Red/Maroon), but not used for consistency as per instructions.

This list captures only obvious, every-example-consistent interactions; no broader puzzle logic inferred.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:59:31] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of distinct non-background "objects" or connected components from a 5-row input grid into a new horizontally concatenated 5-row output grid, with processing steps like vertical padding to 5 rows, horizontal trimming of background columns, and special handling for certain patterns (e.g., involving the number 9). The goal is to identify, filter, and position these components in a specific order (likely left-to-right by their original horizontal position) to form a composite image that matches expected patterns, possibly representing symbols, letters, or rebus elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (g[0][0]), and all components are defined as 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells; isolated single cells are ignored (size >=2 filter).
 * Only components with vertical height <=5 are considered; taller ones are skipped, ensuring everything fits the fixed 5-row output.
 * Vertical padding centers shorter components in a 5-row frame using bg, with uneven padding distributed (top gets floor((5-h)/2), bottom the rest).
 * Horizontal trimming removes leading/trailing columns that are entirely bg, but only after extraction; this can reduce width dynamically.
 * Special handling for height=5 components containing 9: If it has a left vertical bar of identical non-bg values, top/bottom-right 9s, and middle-right bg in rows 1-3, treat as "special" and augment it by adding a 3-column extension with 1s (filling bg areas in middle rows, plus two 1s in the row with a 4); otherwise, skip components with 9 entirely unless special.
 * Components are collected with their bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), then sorted by increasing min_r (top-first? but code uses -min_c for leftmost first, then min_r), and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid with total width summing component widths.
 * Subtle: Extraction must handle out-of-bounds columns gracefully by filling with bg; special case assumes fixed patterns like left bar and right 9s, but may miss variations (e.g., no 4 present or different positions).
 * Ordering is critical: Code sorts by (-min_c, min_r), prioritizing leftmost components first, then top among ties; this may reverse intended right-to-left or other orders.
 * Empty input or no valid components defaults to a single bg cell output.
 * Outputs are always exactly 5 rows; widths vary based on processed components.
 * Potential misses: Components might overlap or touch bg in complex ways; 9-handling seems over-specific and skips too many (e.g., non-special 9s are discarded); no rotation, scaling, or color changes beyond 1-fills in special case.
 * All numbers (1-9, bg like 8?) represent "pixels" of shapes; expected outputs show coherent symbols (e.g., framed 6s, 2-shapes, 3-bars in train1; multi-symbol rows in train2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background from top-left; simple and reliable.)

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r = max_r = i
                min_c = max_c = j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size = 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes is essential and works well for isolating objects; filters appropriately for size and height.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = [g[r][c] if 0 <= c < len(g[0]) else bg for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids, handling edge cases with bg fill; accurate.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Useful for centering short components vertically in 5 rows; correct distribution of padding.)

```python
def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(sub)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(sub[0])
    left = 0
    while left < w and all(sub[r][left] == bg for r in range(h)):
        left += 1
    right = w - 1
    while right > left and all(sub[r][right] == bg for r in range(h)):
        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```
(Effective for removing pure bg columns horizontally; preserves shape without over-trimming.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows good structure for component detection and extraction (e.g., get_non_bg_components correctly finds bounding boxes and filters by size/height), but fails overall due to incorrect processing and arrangement.
 * Train1 generated a tiny 5x3 output with a simple 3-2-3 pattern framed in 8s, but expected a wider 5x12 with multiple distinct symbols (framed 6 with internal 1s/4/9, a 2-shape, and 3-bar); difference: too narrow (only one component?), missed special 9-handling or multiple objects, wrong sorting/concatenation leading to incomplete composite.
 * Train2 generated a bloated 5x29 with overlapping/jumbled numbers (e.g., long rows of 4s and 1s mixed with 3s/5s/6s in wrong positions), but expected a cleaner 5x22 with separated symbols (top/bottom 4-bars, internal 1-2-3-5-6 patterns); difference: excessive width from untrimmed or wrongly extended components, special 9-rule likely misapplied (no 9s visible, but output has artifacts), sorting placed components out of left-to-right order.
 * Special handling for 9-components (augmenting with 1s and skipping non-special) seems overly rigid and buggy: in train1, it probably skipped valid 9-parts or failed pattern match (e.g., no detection of left bar or 4-row), leading to omission; in train2, may have triggered wrongly, adding extra columns.
 * Sorting by (-min_c, min_r) prioritizes leftmost then top, which worked partially for horizontal order but failed to capture all components or right-order in train2 (e.g., 6s appear late but should be mid-right).
 * Default to [[bg]] on no components is safe but not triggered here; overall, extraction works (components found), but integration/concatenation doesn't (wrong widths, missing pieces).
 * No prior attempts, but this code's component logic is a strong base; avoid hardcoding special patterns without flexibility (e.g., exact row checks for 9s/4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with scattered numbers (3s/2s/4s/6s/1s/7s/8s in irregular patterns, e.g., row0 has 3-2-3-2-3 then 6s and 1s; row2 has a 4-1-4 cluster and 7), but it looks incoherent and jumbled, lacking the clean, separated symbol structures seen in expected train outputs (e.g., no framed shapes or aligned bars).
 * It does not appear correct: Width 16 suggests 3-4 components concatenated, but patterns overlap messily (e.g., 7 appears isolated in row2 col11, possibly an unfiltered single cell or extraction error); compared to train expects, it misses vertical alignment and padding (e.g., bottom row has full 3s but uneven 1-6-1), likely from faulty trimming or special handling introducing artifacts.
 * Probable issues: Special 9-rule (test input has no visible 9s, but code skips any with 9) not triggered, yet output has extras like 7 (maybe bg=3? input not shown, but assumes detection failed); sorting may have reversed order, placing left components rightward; overall, it doesn't form recognizable puzzle elements, indicating incomplete component capture or wrong concatenation.

[2025-09-30 23:59:45] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (input/output pairs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear to interact (e.g., containment, adjacency, or transformation effects) in **every** example—meaning both training pairs. I focused on direct, verifiable links like color-to-color containment, hole count influencing embedding, or color-based positional transformations that hold across both inputs and their corresponding outputs. No high-level interpretations or puzzle solutions are included. Connections that are inconsistent (e.g., Red always inside Green, which occurs in train 1 but not train 2), irrelevant (e.g., isolated small shapes without clear interaction), or unexplainable (e.g., exact bbox transformations from scattered to linear positions, which vary too much to call consistent without forcing) are excluded. Unknowns are noted where a partial pattern exists but cannot be fully explained consistently.

1. **Large holed background color → Horizontal strip color in output**:
   - The color of the dominant large-pixel shape with high hole count (e.g., Maroon in train input 1 with holes=3, pixels=527; Yellow in train input 2 with holes=4, pixels=513) consistently transforms into the color of horizontal bars/strips in the output.
   - Interaction: This background color affects the formation of top and bottom horizontal elements spanning most of the output width (e.g., Maroon bars at y=0-1 and y=3-4 in output 1; Yellow bars at y=0-1 and y=3-4 in output 2).
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs. No containment or position tie, but direct color inheritance effect.

2. **Pink → Vertical frame/connector spanning output height**:
   - Pink shapes (rectangular, often with pixels=5-12) consistently form vertical elements that span the full height of the output strip (height 0 to 4 in both outputs).
   - Interaction: Positioned at edges or midpoints to connect horizontal layers (e.g., Pink at x=0, y=0-4 in output 1; Pink at x=11-14, y=0-4 in output 2). No clear hole or pixel transformation, but positional alignment to height is consistent.
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs. Does not interact with background color directly.

3. **Blue (with holes=1) → Contains embedded Yellow**:
   - Blue shapes with holes=1 (pixels=8-18) consistently contain small Yellow elements (pixels=1-2, often single or short horizontal/vertical accents) within their bounding boxes.
   - Interaction: Hole count in Blue enables embedding; Yellow is positioned inside Blue's bbox (e.g., Yellow at [11,3,12,3] and [14,3,15,3] inside Blue [11,1,16,5] in input 2; Yellow [2,2,2,2] inside Blue [1,1,5,3] in output 1; small Yellows [16,2,17,2] and [19,2,20,2] inside Blue [16,0,21,4] in output 2). In train input 1, a similar embedding occurs but with Blue holes=0—however, the holes=1 variant with Yellow is upheld in the other three (input 2, output 1, output 2).
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs (strongest in input 2 and outputs; partial in input 1 but not forced). Position of Yellow shifts but remains internal.

4. **Green (small, holes=0 or 1) → Adjacency or partial containment with Red**:
   - Small Green shapes (pixels=1-8, often holes=0 or 1) consistently interact positionally with Red shapes (pixels=1-7), either adjacent or with Red embedded (when Green has holes=1).
   - Interaction: Green's position or holes affect Red's placement (e.g., Red [14,8,14,8] inside Green [13,7,15,9] holes=1 in input 1; Red [10,2,10,2] inside Green [9,1,11,3] holes=1 in output 1; small Greens [14,2,15,2]/[14,4,15,4] adjacent to Red [15,2,16,4] in input 2). Exact containment is not universal (adjacency in train 2), but spatial tie (inside or next-to) holds.
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs. Cannot explain full transformation (e.g., why adjacency vs. containment varies)—marked as partial/unknown mechanism.

5. **Yellow small embeds → Blue structure positioning**:
   - Small Yellow elements (pixels=1-2) consistently influence or are influenced by Blue structures' positions, appearing embedded and affecting Blue's bbox expansion or hole properties.
   - Interaction: Yellow's position inside Blue leads to Blue having holes=1 and adjusted bbox to encompass it (e.g., as in point 3; also Yellow [6,8,6,8] inside Blue [6,7,9,9] in input 1, where Blue's edges align to Yellow despite holes=0). In outputs, this embedding persists in linear arrangement.
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs. Hole count effect on embedding is clear, but exact bbox scaling is unknown/inconsistent.

### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- These are the only connections that are direct, obvious, and verifiable in **all** provided training data (both pairs). No other color pairs (e.g., Maroon with anything beyond background role), hole counts (e.g., >1 holes not consistently interactive), or positional shifts (e.g., scattered to linear is universal but too vague without specific ties) met the "every puzzle" threshold.
- Irrelevant/excluded: Light Blue (appears sporadically without consistent ties, e.g., only in train 1); Orange (only in train 2); large pixel counts beyond background (no interaction); semantic shapes (e.g., L/H forms mentioned but not consistently linked across examples).
- Unknowns: Precise mechanisms for bbox transformations (e.g., how input positions map to output x-coordinates) cannot be explained consistently—scattered clusters become linear in both, but mappings differ (e.g., no fixed position-to-color rule). No forced connections for test inputs, as instructed. If more examples were provided, additional consistencies might emerge.

[2025-10-01 00:01:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing a scene with a background color and various connected "objects" (blobs of non-background pixels), and the goal is to extract, process, and rearrange these objects into a standardized 5-row output grid by identifying valid components, normalizing their height and trimming, sorting them by horizontal position, and concatenating them side-by-side on a background, effectively creating a "gallery" or "sequence" of processed objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left pixel value; all processing treats non-bg connected pixels (4-directional adjacency) as part of objects.
 * Only include components that are short (height <=5) and have at least 2 pixels (size >=2); taller or single-pixel components are ignored to filter out irrelevant elements like bars or noise.
 * Extraction: Subgrids are pulled directly from the bounding box of each component, with out-of-bounds treated as bg.
 * Processing subtleties: Subgrids must be padded vertically to exactly 5 rows (centered if possible), and horizontally trimmed to remove leading/trailing all-bg columns (but keep at least the core if not empty); however, arbitrary filling (e.g., setting inner bg to 1 if 9 is present) alters pixel values incorrectly and should be avoided—pixels should remain as-is unless padding.
 * Sorting: Components are sorted primarily by leftmost column (min_c), secondarily by top row (min_r) to maintain left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order in the output.
 * Output construction: All processed subgrids are concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid, with bg filling any gaps; if no components, output a single bg cell; total width is the sum of trimmed subgrid widths.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components may overlap or be adjacent but are treated separately if not connected; bg can appear inside objects (holes), but the code doesn't fill them—potential need to detect/fill holes or preserve them; 9 might indicate special cases (e.g., "filled" or "target" objects), but forcing changes based on it breaks fidelity; ensure no vertical padding affects width; handle empty processed subgrids by skipping them.
 * Across attempts (this is the first): No rotation, scaling, or value remapping beyond padding/trimming; output must exactly match expected pixel values and dimensions, including bg placement; test cases may have asymmetric padding or irregular shapes that trimming must handle precisely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background from top-left, assuming consistent bg.)

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size = 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding box and filtering is solid and essential for identifying objects; uses stack for efficiency.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = [g[r][c] if 0 <= c < len(g[0]) else bg for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(This bounding box extraction is helpful and preserves original values, handling edges correctly.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Simple tuple key for sorting components left-to-right then top-to-bottom; useful for output order.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg, finds connected components with proper filtering (height <=5, size >=2), extracts bounding subgrids without alteration, pads vertically to 5 rows (centered), trims horizontal bg columns, sorts by position, and concatenates into a 5-row output—basic structure works for arrangement.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated a 5x16 grid with misplaced values (e.g., 9s and 6s in wrong positions, extra columns from untrimmed or wrong components, inner rows have altered 1s/2s/3s/4s that don't match expected 5x12 with specific 6/1/4/2/3/8/9 placements); likely due to including extraneous components or poor trimming, resulting in wider output and value mismatches (e.g., expected starts with [6,8,9,...] but generated has [8,8,8,9,...]).
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x29 grid (too wide) with jumbled values (e.g., long stretches of 4s and misplaced 1/2/3/5/6/8), while expected is 5x22 with cleaner separation of components (e.g., expected has grouped 4s then 6s then objects); suggests over-inclusion of bg-adjacent pixels or failure to trim properly, plus possible asymmetric component extraction.
 * The process_subgrid function's contains_9 check and forced setting of inner bg to 1 is broken/unhelpful—it arbitrarily changes pixels (e.g., filling "holes" incorrectly), leading to value alterations not seen in expecteds; don't use this logic, as it introduces 1s where none should be and ignores true object shapes.
 * Overall, attempt shows good skeleton for component detection and layout but fails on fidelity (wrong widths, values) due to incorrect processing; no handling for holes or special values like 9 beyond bad filling; trimming works partially but not enough to match dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with values like clustered 1/3/4/6/8 and a 2/7 in row 3, but it does not look correct—width (16) mismatches training expecteds' patterns (e.g., train1=12, train2=22), and values seem disorganized (e.g., row 0 has 4s/6s/1s/3s/2s but no clear object separation; row 2 has a lone 7 which may be an artifact or unfiltered single-pixel); likely includes invalid components or poor trimming, as expecteds have tight, symmetric objects without outliers like 7.
 * Compared to training, it over-arranges (extra columns) and alters placements (e.g., 8s scattered vs. expected blocks); doesn't make sense as a "gallery" since shapes blend (e.g., row 4 has long 1/3/6 run without bg separation); to fix, ensure stricter component validation and no value changes to match expected clean outputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of distinct non-background "objects" or connected components from a 5-row input grid into a new horizontally concatenated 5-row output grid, with processing steps like vertical padding to 5 rows, horizontal trimming of background columns, and special handling for certain patterns (e.g., involving the number 9). The goal is to identify, filter, and position these components in a specific order (likely left-to-right by their original horizontal position) to form a composite image that matches expected patterns, possibly representing symbols, letters, or rebus elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (g[0][0]), and all components are defined as 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells; isolated single cells are ignored (size >=2 filter).
 * Only components with vertical height <=5 are considered; taller ones are skipped, ensuring everything fits the fixed 5-row output.
 * Vertical padding centers shorter components in a 5-row frame using bg, with uneven padding distributed (top gets floor((5-h)/2), bottom the rest).
 * Horizontal trimming removes leading/trailing columns that are entirely bg, but only after extraction; this can reduce width dynamically.
 * Special handling for height=5 components containing 9: If it has a left vertical bar of identical non-bg values, top/bottom-right 9s, and middle-right bg in rows 1-3, treat as "special" and augment it by adding a 3-column extension with 1s (filling bg areas in middle rows, plus two 1s in the row with a 4); otherwise, skip components with 9 entirely unless special.
 * Components are collected with their bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), then sorted by increasing min_r (top-first? but code uses -min_c for leftmost first, then min_r), and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid with total width summing component widths.
 * Subtle: Extraction must handle out-of-bounds columns gracefully by filling with bg; special case assumes fixed patterns like left bar and right 9s, but may miss variations (e.g., no 4 present or different positions).
 * Ordering is critical: Code sorts by (-min_c, min_r), prioritizing leftmost components first, then top among ties; this may reverse intended right-to-left or other orders.
 * Empty input or no valid components defaults to a single bg cell output.
 * Outputs are always exactly 5 rows; widths vary based on processed components.
 * Potential misses: Components might overlap or touch bg in complex ways; 9-handling seems over-specific and skips too many (e.g., non-special 9s are discarded); no rotation, scaling, or color changes beyond 1-fills in special case.
 * All numbers (1-9, bg like 8?) represent "pixels" of shapes; expected outputs show coherent symbols (e.g., framed 6s, 2-shapes, 3-bars in train1; multi-symbol rows in train2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes is essential and works well for isolating objects; filters appropriately for size and height.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = [g[r][c] if 0 <= c < len(g[0]) else bg for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids, handling edge cases with bg fill; accurate.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Useful for centering short components vertically in 5 rows; correct distribution of padding.)

```python
def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(sub)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(sub[0])
    left = 0
    while left < w and all(sub[r][left] == bg for r in range(h)):
        left += 1
    right = w - 1
    while right > left and all(sub[r][right] == bg for r in range(h)):
        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```
(Effective for removing pure bg columns horizontally; preserves shape without over-trimming.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows good structure for component detection and extraction (e.g., get_non_bg_components correctly finds bounding boxes and filters by size/height), but fails overall due to incorrect processing and arrangement.
 * Train1 generated a tiny 5x3 output with a simple 3-2-3 pattern framed in 8s, but expected a wider 5x12 with multiple distinct symbols (framed 6 with internal 1s/4/9, a 2-shape, and 3-bar); difference: too narrow (only one component?), missed special 9-handling or multiple objects, wrong sorting/concatenation leading to incomplete composite.
 * Train2 generated a bloated 5x29 with overlapping/jumbled numbers (e.g., long rows of 4s and 1s mixed with 3s/5s/6s in wrong positions), but expected a cleaner 5x22 with separated symbols (top/bottom 4-bars, internal 1-2-3-5-6 patterns); difference: excessive width from untrimmed or wrongly extended components, special 9-rule likely misapplied (no 9s visible, but output has artifacts), sorting placed components out of left-to-right order.
 * Special handling for 9-components (augmenting with 1s and skipping non-special) seems overly rigid and buggy: in train1, it probably skipped valid 9-parts or failed pattern match (e.g., no detection of left bar or 4-row), leading to omission; in train2, may have triggered wrongly, adding extra columns.
 * Sorting by (-min_c, min_r) prioritizes leftmost then top, which worked partially for horizontal order but failed to capture all components or right-order in train2 (e.g., 6s appear late but should be mid-right).
 * Default to [[bg]] on no components is safe but not triggered here; overall, extraction works (components found), but integration/concatenation doesn't (wrong widths, missing pieces).
 * No prior attempts, but this code's component logic is a strong base; avoid hardcoding special patterns without flexibility (e.g., exact row checks for 9s/4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with scattered numbers (3s/2s/4s/6s/1s/7s/8s in irregular patterns, e.g., row0 has 3-2-3-2-3 then 6s and 1s; row2 has a 4-1-4 cluster and 7), but it looks incoherent and jumbled, lacking the clean, separated symbol structures seen in expected train outputs (e.g., no framed shapes or aligned bars).
 * It does not appear correct: Width 16 suggests 3-4 components concatenated, but patterns overlap messily (e.g., 7 appears isolated in row2 col11, possibly an unfiltered single cell or extraction error); compared to train expects, it misses vertical alignment and padding (e.g., bottom row has full 3s but uneven 1-6-1), likely from faulty trimming or special handling introducing artifacts.
 * Probable issues: Special 9-rule (test input has no visible 9s, but code skips any with 9) not triggered, yet output has extras like 7 (maybe bg=3? input not shown, but assumes detection failed); sorting may have reversed order, placing left components rightward; overall, it doesn't form recognizable puzzle elements, indicating incomplete component capture or wrong concatenation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
This correctly identifies the background color from top-left.

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Basic and correct for determining background.

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                size = 0
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size += 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, size))
    return components
```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (input/output pairs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear to interact (e.g., containment, adjacency, or transformation effects) in **every** example—meaning both training pairs. I focused on direct, verifiable links like color-to-color containment, hole count influencing embedding, or color-based positional transformations that hold across both inputs and their corresponding outputs. No high-level interpretations or puzzle solutions are included. Connections that are inconsistent (e.g., Red always inside Green, which occurs in train 1 but not train 2), irrelevant (e.g., isolated small shapes without clear interaction), or unexplainable (e.g., exact bbox transformations from scattered to linear positions, which vary too much to call consistent without forcing) are excluded. Unknowns are noted where a partial pattern exists but cannot be fully explained consistently.

1. **Large holed background color → Horizontal strip color in output**:
   - The color of the dominant large-pixel shape with high hole count (e.g., Maroon in train input 1 with holes=3, pixels=527; Yellow in train input 2 with holes=4, pixels=513) consistently transforms into the color of horizontal bars/strips in the output.
   - Interaction: This background color affects the formation of top and bottom horizontal elements spanning most of the output width (e.g., Maroon bars at y=0-1 and y=3-4 in output 1; Yellow bars at y=0-1 and y=3-4 in output 2).
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs. No containment or position tie, but direct color inheritance effect.

2. **Pink → Vertical frame/connector spanning output height**:
   - Pink shapes (rectangular, often with pixels=5-12) consistently form vertical elements that span the full height of the output strip (height 0 to 4 in both outputs).
   - Interaction: Positioned at edges or midpoints to connect horizontal layers (e.g., Pink at x=0, y=0-4 in output 1; Pink at x=11-14, y=0-4 in output 2). No clear hole or pixel transformation, but positional alignment to height is consistent.
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs. Does not interact with background color directly.

3. **Blue (with holes=1) → Contains embedded Yellow**:
   - Blue shapes with holes=1 (pixels=8-18) consistently contain small Yellow elements (pixels=1-2, often single or short horizontal/vertical accents) within their bounding boxes.
   - Interaction: Hole count in Blue enables embedding; Yellow is positioned inside Blue's bbox (e.g., Yellow at [11,3,12,3] and [14,3,15,3] inside Blue [11,1,16,5] in input 2; Yellow [2,2,2,2] inside Blue [1,1,5,3] in output 1; small Yellows [16,2,17,2] and [19,2,20,2] inside Blue [16,0,21,4] in output 2). In train input 1, a similar embedding occurs but with Blue holes=0—however, the holes=1 variant with Yellow is upheld in the other three (input 2, output 1, output 2).
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs (strongest in input 2 and outputs; partial in input 1 but not forced). Position of Yellow shifts but remains internal.

4. **Green (small, holes=0 or 1) → Adjacency or partial containment with Red**:
   - Small Green shapes (pixels=1-8, often holes=0 or 1) consistently interact positionally with Red shapes (pixels=1-7), either adjacent or with Red embedded (when Green has holes=1).
   - Interaction: Green's position or holes affect Red's placement (e.g., Red [14,8,14,8] inside Green [13,7,15,9] holes=1 in input 1; Red [10,2,10,2] inside Green [9,1,11,3] holes=1 in output 1; small Greens [14,2,15,2]/[14,4,15,4] adjacent to Red [15,2,16,4] in input 2). Exact containment is not universal (adjacency in train 2), but spatial tie (inside or next-to) holds.
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs. Cannot explain full transformation (e.g., why adjacency vs. containment varies)—marked as partial/unknown mechanism.

5. **Yellow small embeds → Blue structure positioning**:
   - Small Yellow elements (pixels=1-2) consistently influence or are influenced by Blue structures' positions, appearing embedded and affecting Blue's bbox expansion or hole properties.
   - Interaction: Yellow's position inside Blue leads to Blue having holes=1 and adjusted bbox to encompass it (e.g., as in point 3; also Yellow [6,8,6,8] inside Blue [6,7,9,9] in input 1, where Blue's edges align to Yellow despite holes=0). In outputs, this embedding persists in linear arrangement.
   - Consistent across: Both training pairs. Hole count effect on embedding is clear, but exact bbox scaling is unknown/inconsistent.

### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- These are the only connections that are direct, obvious, and verifiable in **all** provided training data (both pairs). No other color pairs (e.g., Maroon with anything beyond background role), hole counts (e.g., >1 holes not consistently interactive), or positional shifts (e.g., scattered to linear is universal but too vague without specific ties) met the "every puzzle" threshold.
- Irrelevant/excluded: Light Blue (appears sporadically without consistent ties, e.g., only in train 1); Orange (only in train 2); large pixel counts beyond background (no interaction); semantic shapes (e.g., L/H forms mentioned but not consistently linked across examples).
- Unknowns: Precise mechanisms for bbox transformations (e.g., how input positions map to output x-coordinates) cannot be explained consistently—scattered clusters become linear in both, but mappings differ (e.g., no fixed position-to-color rule). No forced connections for test inputs, as instructed. If more examples were provided, additional consistencies might emerge.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input generated output:
[3]
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):

    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 00:08:40] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented as 2D lists of integers (likely colors or pixel values), where the task is to detect, extract, process (e.g., pad, trim), and rearrange specific structural elements like vertical bars with end markers (special frames) and connected components (simple shapes or blobs) into a new 5-row horizontal layout, sorted by position with gaps between disconnected elements. The background value (often 8 or similar) is used for padding and trimming, and the output must exactly match expected patterns without extras or omissions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection is key: Assume the top-left cell (g[0][0]) is the background (bg), used for padding empty areas and trimming borders; mismatches here could propagate errors.
 * Special frames: Look for vertical 5-cell-high bars of uniform non-bg color starting from row 0- (rows-5), with a horizontal connector marked by 9s at top and bottom rows; extract the subgrid from bar start to the rightmost 9 position, and pad to width 4 if shorter (but only add specific values like 1 in middle rows? code has bugs here).
 * Simple components: Use flood-fill to find connected regions (4-directional) of same color, non-bg; filter to height <=5 and size >=2; skip if they contain a '4' (perhaps indicating a hole or special marker) or if original height <5; pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centered; trim left/right bg columns only if entire column is bg.
 * Arrangement: Process special frames first (sorted left-to-right by start column), place them contiguously in output; then simple components below the max row of specials, sorted by (start_col, start_row); add 2 bg columns as gaps between groups if not adjacent (check if min_c == prev_max_c +1); entire output is 5 rows high, trimmed to used width.
 * Sorting and positioning: Components must respect original relative horizontal positions; specials seem to start from top rows, simples only if below specials' extent.
 * Subtleties: Padding for specials adds columns with specific non-bg values (e.g., 1 in rows 1-3) if width <4, but this seems buggy; avoid processing visited cells to prevent overlap; handle empty grids by returning [[bg]]; connected components must be same-color only; trim after padding can remove added bg but preserve content; '4' in a component likely flags it as invalid (e.g., contains a hole, skip it).
 * Edge cases: Grids with no elements return single bg cell; components spanning >5 rows are ignored; horizontal bars or non-vertical specials are not handled; test inputs may have isolated cells or minimal structures that collapse to single values.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with no trailing bg columns; if all bg, return [[bg]].

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

```python
def contains_four(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(4 in row for row in sub)  # Quick check to skip components with '4' (possible hole marker); simple but effective filter.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects background correctly and uses flood-fill for components, which works for identifying simple blobs (e.g., the 1s, 2s, 3s in train 1).
 * Special frame detection partially works: It finds vertical bars and 9-endpoints, extracts subgrids, but fails to pad correctly (adds wrong values like 1s in bg areas, leading to extras in output).
 * Simple component extraction and padding/trimming works somewhat (pads to 5 rows, trims sides), but skips too many (e.g., those with '4' correctly, but placement ignores vertical position fully).
 * Arrangement logic is close but buggy: Sorts by column then row, adds 2-bg gaps for non-adjacent simples (good for separation), but places all specials first contiguously without gaps, and max_end filter skips too many simples (e.g., in train 1, some shapes like the 2-3 cluster are misplaced or split).
 * Train 1 generated output has correct frame at left (6-8-9-8 top/bottom), but extras like repeated 8s, misplaced 1s/4, and full 2-3 shapes jammed without proper gaps; expected has compact frame, then 1-blob with 4 inside (but skipped?), then 2-3 with gaps omitted—unknown why generated is longer/wider.
 * Train 2 generated just [4] (single row/cell?), but expected is full 5x22 grid with bars (4s), numbers (1-6), and shapes; attempt completely fails to detect/extract anything meaningful, likely because no 5-high bars or components below max_end, and trim/pad collapses everything.
 * find_special_frames is helpful but broken: Wrong padding logic (adds 1s instead of bg?), marks visited incorrectly, sorts by column but places without position awareness.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of extraction/padding but fails on integration, filtering (e.g., includes invalid components), and exact matching (e.g., no gaps in expected train 1 for adjacent shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is [3] (single row with one cell), which does not look correct; it resembles a collapsed or empty result, ignoring the complexity seen in training examples (e.g., train 2 expected has multi-row structures with numbers 1-8).
 * Likely misses all special frames and components, perhaps due to no 5-high bars, small size (<2), or all treated as bg; expected probably a simple processed shape or bar around the '3', but single cell suggests total failure in detection/extraction.
 * Does not match puzzle rules: Outputs should be 5 rows unless empty (then [[bg]]), and '3' alone ignores padding/arrangement; need to verify if test input has isolated '3' as a component (size=1, should skip) or part of larger structure.

[2025-10-01 00:08:40] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing a scene with a background color and various connected "objects" (blobs of non-background pixels), and the goal is to extract, process, and rearrange these objects into a standardized 5-row output grid by identifying valid components, normalizing their height and trimming, sorting them by horizontal position, and concatenating them side-by-side on a background, effectively creating a "gallery" or "sequence" of processed objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left pixel value; all processing treats non-bg connected pixels (4-directional adjacency) as part of objects.
 * Only include components that are short (height <=5) and have at least 2 pixels (size >=2); taller or single-pixel components are ignored to filter out irrelevant elements like bars or noise.
 * Extraction: Subgrids are pulled directly from the bounding box of each component, with out-of-bounds treated as bg.
 * Processing subtleties: Subgrids must be padded vertically to exactly 5 rows (centered if possible), and horizontally trimmed to remove leading/trailing all-bg columns (but keep at least the core if not empty); however, arbitrary filling (e.g., setting inner bg to 1 if 9 is present) alters pixel values incorrectly and should be avoided—pixels should remain as-is unless padding.
 * Sorting: Components are sorted primarily by leftmost column (min_c), secondarily by top row (min_r) to maintain left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order in the output.
 * Output construction: All processed subgrids are concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid, with bg filling any gaps; if no components, output a single bg cell; total width is the sum of trimmed subgrid widths.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components may overlap or be adjacent but are treated separately if not connected; bg can appear inside objects (holes), but the code doesn't fill them—potential need to detect/fill holes or preserve them; 9 might indicate special cases (e.g., "filled" or "target" objects), but forcing changes based on it breaks fidelity; ensure no vertical padding affects width; handle empty processed subgrids by skipping them.
 * Across attempts (this is the first): No rotation, scaling, or value remapping beyond padding/trimming; output must exactly match expected pixel values and dimensions, including bg placement; test cases may have asymmetric padding or irregular shapes that trimming must handle precisely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background from top-left, assuming consistent bg.)

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size = 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding box and filtering is solid and essential for identifying objects; uses stack for efficiency.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = [g[r][c] if 0 <= c < len(g[0]) else bg for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(This bounding box extraction is helpful and preserves original values, handling edges correctly.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Simple tuple key for sorting components left-to-right then top-to-bottom; useful for output order.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg, finds connected components with proper filtering (height <=5, size >=2), extracts bounding subgrids without alteration, pads vertically to 5 rows (centered), trims horizontal bg columns, sorts by position, and concatenates into a 5-row output—basic structure works for arrangement.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated a 5x16 grid with misplaced values (e.g., 9s and 6s in wrong positions, extra columns from untrimmed or wrong components, inner rows have altered 1s/2s/3s/4s that don't match expected 5x12 with specific 6/1/4/2/3/8/9 placements); likely due to including extraneous components or poor trimming, resulting in wider output and value mismatches (e.g., expected starts with [6,8,9,...] but generated has [8,8,8,9,...]).
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x29 grid (too wide) with jumbled values (e.g., long stretches of 4s and misplaced 1/2/3/5/6/8), while expected is 5x22 with cleaner separation of components (e.g., expected has grouped 4s then 6s then objects); suggests over-inclusion of bg-adjacent pixels or failure to trim properly, plus possible asymmetric component extraction.
 * The process_subgrid function's contains_9 check and forced setting of inner bg to 1 is broken/unhelpful—it arbitrarily changes pixels (e.g., filling "holes" incorrectly), leading to value alterations not seen in expecteds; don't use this logic, as it introduces 1s where none should be and ignores true object shapes.
 * Overall, attempt shows good skeleton for component detection and layout but fails on fidelity (wrong widths, values) due to incorrect processing; no handling for holes or special values like 9 beyond bad filling; trimming works partially but not enough to match dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with values like clustered 1/3/4/6/8 and a 2/7 in row 3, but it does not look correct—width (16) mismatches training expecteds' patterns (e.g., train1=12, train2=22), and values seem disorganized (e.g., row 0 has 4s/6s/1s/3s/2s but no clear object separation; row 2 has a lone 7 which may be an artifact or unfiltered single-pixel); likely includes invalid components or poor trimming, as expecteds have tight, symmetric objects without outliers like 7.
 * Compared to training, it over-arranges (extra columns) and alters placements (e.g., 8s scattered vs. expected blocks); doesn't make sense as a "gallery" since shapes blend (e.g., row 4 has long 1/3/6 run without bg separation); to fix, ensure stricter component validation and no value changes to match expected clean outputs.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of distinct non-background "objects" or connected components from a 5-row input grid into a new horizontally concatenated 5-row output grid, with processing steps like vertical padding to 5 rows, horizontal trimming of background columns, and special handling for certain patterns (e.g., involving the number 9). The goal is to identify, filter, and position these components in a specific order (likely left-to-right by their original horizontal position) to form a composite image that matches expected patterns, possibly representing symbols, letters, or rebus elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (g[0][0]), and all components are defined as 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells; isolated single cells are ignored (size >=2 filter).
 * Only components with vertical height <=5 are considered; taller ones are skipped, ensuring everything fits the fixed 5-row output.
 * Vertical padding centers shorter components in a 5-row frame using bg, with uneven padding distributed (top gets floor((5-h)/2), bottom the rest).
 * Horizontal trimming removes leading/trailing columns that are entirely bg, but only after extraction; this can reduce width dynamically.
 * Special handling for height=5 components containing 9: If it has a left vertical bar of identical non-bg values, top/bottom-right 9s, and middle-right bg in rows 1-3, treat as "special" and augment it by adding a 3-column extension with 1s (filling bg areas in middle rows, plus two 1s in the row with a 4); otherwise, skip components with 9 entirely unless special.
 * Components are collected with their bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), then sorted by increasing min_r (top-first? but code uses -min_c for leftmost first, then min_r), and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid with total width summing component widths.
 * Subtle: Extraction must handle out-of-bounds columns gracefully by filling with bg; special case assumes fixed patterns like left bar and right 9s, but may miss variations (e.g., no 4 present or different positions).
 * Ordering is critical: Code sorts by (-min_c, min_r), prioritizing leftmost components first, then top among ties; this may reverse intended right-to-left or other orders.
 * Empty input or no valid components defaults to a single bg cell output.
 * Outputs are always exactly 5 rows; widths vary based on processed components.
 * Potential misses: Components might overlap or touch bg in complex ways; 9-handling seems over-specific and skips too many (e.g., non-special 9s are discarded); no rotation, scaling, or color changes beyond 1-fills in special case.
 * All numbers (1-9, bg like 8?) represent "pixels" of shapes; expected outputs show coherent symbols (e.g., framed 6s, 2-shapes, 3-bars in train1; multi-symbol rows in train2).

                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True

                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))

```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes is essential and works well for isolating objects; filters appropriately for size and height.)

        row = [g[r][c] if 0 <= c < len(g[0]) else bg for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids, handling edge cases with bg fill; accurate.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Useful for centering short components vertically in 5 rows; correct distribution of padding.)

```python
def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(sub)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(sub[0])
    left = 0
    while left < w and all(sub[r][left] == bg for r in range(h)):
        left += 1
    right = w - 1
    while right > left and all(sub[r][right] == bg for r in range(h)):
        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```
(Effective for removing pure bg columns horizontally; preserves shape without over-trimming.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows good structure for component detection and extraction (e.g., get_non_bg_components correctly finds bounding boxes and filters by size/height), but fails overall due to incorrect processing and arrangement.
 * Train1 generated a tiny 5x3 output with a simple 3-2-3 pattern framed in 8s, but expected a wider 5x12 with multiple distinct symbols (framed 6 with internal 1s/4/9, a 2-shape, and 3-bar); difference: too narrow (only one component?), missed special 9-handling or multiple objects, wrong sorting/concatenation leading to incomplete composite.
 * Train2 generated a bloated 5x29 with overlapping/jumbled numbers (e.g., long rows of 4s and 1s mixed with 3s/5s/6s in wrong positions), but expected a cleaner 5x22 with separated symbols (top/bottom 4-bars, internal 1-2-3-5-6 patterns); difference: excessive width from untrimmed or wrongly extended components, special 9-rule likely misapplied (no 9s visible, but output has artifacts), sorting placed components out of left-to-right order.
 * Special handling for 9-components (augmenting with 1s and skipping non-special) seems overly rigid and buggy: in train1, it probably skipped valid 9-parts or failed pattern match (e.g., no detection of left bar or 4-row), leading to omission; in train2, may have triggered wrongly, adding extra columns.
 * Sorting by (-min_c, min_r) prioritizes leftmost then top, which worked partially for horizontal order but failed to capture all components or right-order in train2 (e.g., 6s appear late but should be mid-right).
 * Default to [[bg]] on no components is safe but not triggered here; overall, extraction works (components found), but integration/concatenation doesn't (wrong widths, missing pieces).
 * No prior attempts, but this code's component logic is a strong base; avoid hardcoding special patterns without flexibility (e.g., exact row checks for 9s/4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with scattered numbers (3s/2s/4s/6s/1s/7s/8s in irregular patterns, e.g., row0 has 3-2-3-2-3 then 6s and 1s; row2 has a 4-1-4 cluster and 7), but it looks incoherent and jumbled, lacking the clean, separated symbol structures seen in expected train outputs (e.g., no framed shapes or aligned bars).
 * It does not appear correct: Width 16 suggests 3-4 components concatenated, but patterns overlap messily (e.g., 7 appears isolated in row2 col11, possibly an unfiltered single cell or extraction error); compared to train expects, it misses vertical alignment and padding (e.g., bottom row has full 3s but uneven 1-6-1), likely from faulty trimming or special handling introducing artifacts.
 * Probable issues: Special 9-rule (test input has no visible 9s, but code skips any with 9) not triggered, yet output has extras like 7 (maybe bg=3? input not shown, but assumes detection failed); sorting may have reversed order, placing left components rightward; overall, it doesn't form recognizable puzzle elements, indicating incomplete component capture or wrong concatenation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented as 2D lists of integers (likely colors or pixel values), where the task is to detect, extract, process (e.g., pad, trim), and rearrange specific structural elements like vertical bars with end markers (special frames) and connected components (simple shapes or blobs) into a new 5-row horizontal layout, sorted by position with gaps between disconnected elements. The background value (often 8 or similar) is used for padding and trimming, and the output must exactly match expected patterns without extras or omissions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection is key: Assume the top-left cell (g[0][0]) is the background (bg), used for padding empty areas and trimming borders; mismatches here could propagate errors.
 * Special frames: Look for vertical 5-cell-high bars of uniform non-bg color starting from row 0- (rows-5), with a horizontal connector marked by 9s at top and bottom rows; extract the subgrid from bar start to the rightmost 9 position, and pad to width 4 if shorter (but only add specific values like 1 in middle rows? code has bugs here).
 * Simple components: Use flood-fill to find connected regions (4-directional) of same color, non-bg; filter to height <=5 and size >=2; skip if they contain a '4' (perhaps indicating a hole or special marker) or if original height <5; pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centered; trim left/right bg columns only if entire column is bg.
 * Arrangement: Process special frames first (sorted left-to-right by start column), place them contiguously in output; then simple components below the max row of specials, sorted by (start_col, start_row); add 2 bg columns as gaps between groups if not adjacent (check if min_c == prev_max_c +1); entire output is 5 rows high, trimmed to used width.
 * Sorting and positioning: Components must respect original relative horizontal positions; specials seem to start from top rows, simples only if below specials' extent.
 * Subtleties: Padding for specials adds columns with specific non-bg values (e.g., 1 in rows 1-3) if width <4, but this seems buggy; avoid processing visited cells to prevent overlap; handle empty grids by returning [[bg]]; connected components must be same-color only; trim after padding can remove added bg but preserve content; '4' in a component likely flags it as invalid (e.g., contains a hole, skip it).
 * Edge cases: Grids with no elements return single bg cell; components spanning >5 rows are ignored; horizontal bars or non-vertical specials are not handled; test inputs may have isolated cells or minimal structures that collapse to single values.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with no trailing bg columns; if all bg, return [[bg]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects background correctly and uses flood-fill for components, which works for identifying simple blobs (e.g., the 1s, 2s, 3s in train 1).
 * Special frame detection partially works: It finds vertical bars and 9-endpoints, extracts subgrids, but fails to pad correctly (adds wrong values like 1s in bg areas, leading to extras in output).
 * Simple component extraction and padding/trimming works somewhat (pads to 5 rows, trims sides), but skips too many (e.g., those with '4' correctly, but placement ignores vertical position fully).
 * Arrangement logic is close but buggy: Sorts by column then row, adds 2-bg gaps for non-adjacent simples (good for separation), but places all specials first contiguously without gaps, and max_end filter skips too many simples (e.g., in train 1, some shapes like the 2-3 cluster are misplaced or split).
 * Train 1 generated output has correct frame at left (6-8-9-8 top/bottom), but extras like repeated 8s, misplaced 1s/4, and full 2-3 shapes jammed without proper gaps; expected has compact frame, then 1-blob with 4 inside (but skipped?), then 2-3 with gaps omitted—unknown why generated is longer/wider.
 * Train 2 generated just [4] (single row/cell?), but expected is full 5x22 grid with bars (4s), numbers (1-6), and shapes; attempt completely fails to detect/extract anything meaningful, likely because no 5-high bars or components below max_end, and trim/pad collapses everything.
 * find_special_frames is helpful but broken: Wrong padding logic (adds 1s instead of bg?), marks visited incorrectly, sorts by column but places without position awareness.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of extraction/padding but fails on integration, filtering (e.g., includes invalid components), and exact matching (e.g., no gaps in expected train 1 for adjacent shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is [3] (single row with one cell), which does not look correct; it resembles a collapsed or empty result, ignoring the complexity seen in training examples (e.g., train 2 expected has multi-row structures with numbers 1-8).
 * Likely misses all special frames and components, perhaps due to no 5-high bars, small size (<2), or all treated as bg; expected probably a simple processed shape or bar around the '3', but single cell suggests total failure in detection/extraction.
 * Does not match puzzle rules: Outputs should be 5 rows unless empty (then [[bg]]), and '3' alone ignores padding/arrangement; need to verify if test input has isolated '3' as a component (size=1, should skip) or part of larger structure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Basic and correct for determining background.

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                size = 0
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size += 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, size))
    return components
```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 00:16:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row grid where numbers represent colored pixels or segments forming "objects" or symbols (like digits or shapes). The goal is to extract connected components (blobs of the same number, excluding background), process them into standardized 5-high subgrids (padding vertically if needed, extending or modifying for special cases like presence of 9, trimming edges), group horizontally adjacent processed subgrids, prioritize or filter "special" components (those containing 9), and output a single horizontal concatenation of these groups with 2-unit background gaps between groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined as the top-left cell value (often 8 or 4 or 3); all processing ignores it.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-background color; only include if height <=5 and size >=2 (filters out small noise or single cells).
 * Omit components containing 4 but not 9 (likely a rule to ignore certain invalid or partial shapes).
 * For components shorter than 5 rows, pad vertically with background in the middle (symmetric top/bottom).
 * If a component contains 9 (special case, perhaps indicating a "key" or extensible shape like a digit with a stem), extend the subgrid width by 1 column and manually set positions [1:4] in the new column to 1 (this seems like adding a specific extension, e.g., a vertical line or hook, but it's hardcoded and may be incorrect).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from subgrids.
 * Group processed subgrids if they are horizontally adjacent (next min_c == current max_c +1), concatenating them into wider blocks without gaps inside groups.
 * Separate "special" (contains 9) from "normal" components; for specials, filter normals to only those starting at or above the lowest special's row (max_special_min_r, but code uses max of specials' min_r—wait, code says max_special_min_r = max(p[3] for p in special), which is the deepest starting row among specials, then normal = [p for p in normal if p[3] <= max_special_min_r], so keeping normals that start at or before that depth; this may be backwards or buggy).
 * Sort both special and normal groups by leftmost column (min_c) before grouping.
 * Final output: Concatenate all processed groups (specials first, then normals) horizontally with exactly 2 background cells as gaps between groups; output is always 5 rows high, width varies.
 * Subtle: Extraction assumes grid is rectangular; subgrids may need bounds checking. Presence of 9 triggers width extension but only if h==5? (code does it after padding, but only if has9). Trimming can empty a subgrid, leading to None (omit). Gaps are fixed at 2, but may need adjustment if groups touch or overlap. Components can overlap in rows (vertical stacking not handled, only horizontal grouping). Numbers like 1,2,3 may represent specific shape parts (e.g., 1=fill, 2=stroke), and 9/4 may be markers for validity/extension.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must update bounding box (min/max r/c) correctly during stack traversal (code does, but size increments inside loop). Padding is vertical only, no horizontal padding. Special filtering might intend to include only "above" specials but code uses <= on min_r, potentially including deeper normals incorrectly. Output starts with background-padded single row if no components.
 * All attempts must handle variable widths, ensure no internal gaps in groups, and preserve exact pixel values (no color changes except the hardcoded 1's for specials).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Determines background color from top-left; simple and reliable.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    # Flood-fill to find 4-connected components of same color, returning (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, color)
    # Only if height <=5 and size >=2; uses stack for DFS, updates visited and bounds correctly.
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                color = g[i][j]
                min_r = max_r = i
                min_c = max_c = j
                size = 1
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, color))
    return components
```
(Essential for extracting blob bounding boxes; works well for identifying objects.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts rectangular subgrid, padding with bg if out-of-bounds (though code assumes in-bounds).
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = [g[r][c] if 0 <= c < len(g[0]) else bg for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
        sub.append(row)
    return sub

def contains_value(sub: List[List[int]], val: int) -> bool:
    return any(val in row for row in sub)

def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads to exactly 5 rows with bg, symmetric top/bottom.
    h = len(sub)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(sub[0])
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded

def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Trims leading/trailing full-bg columns; useful for cleaning edges but can empty if all bg.
    if not sub:
        return []
    h = len(sub)
    w = len(sub[0])
    left = 0
    while left < w and all(sub[r][left] == bg for r in range(h)):
        left += 1
    right = w - 1
    while right > left and all(sub[r][right] == bg for r in range(h)):
        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```
(These are core for subgrid handling; extraction and trimming are solid, padding works for vertical alignment.)

```python
def concat_subgrids(subs: List[List[List[int]]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Horizontally concatenates a list of 5-high subgrids into one wider grid; assumes all 5 rows.
    if not subs:
        return []
    h = 5
    w_total = sum(len(s[0]) for s in subs)
    result = [[0] * w_total for _ in range(h)]  # Note: initializes to 0, should be bg?
    current = 0
    for s in subs:
        w = len(s[0])
        for r in range(h):
            for c in range(w):
                result[r][current + c] = s[r][c]
        current += w
    return result
```
(Helpful for building groups; but init to 0 is a bug—should use bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) detailed attempt shown, but it partially works: Component extraction via flood-fill correctly identifies blobs and bounds; vertical padding and trimming clean subgrids appropriately; grouping adjacent subgrids horizontally without internal gaps is a good approach.
 * What didn't work: In Train 1, generated output has incorrect left-side structure (full rows of 8's/bg with misplaced 3's and 2's forming a malformed shape, ending in a stray 6 column), vs expected which starts with 6's as left border/gap?, has a proper 1-4-9 shape (likely a processed special with extension), isolated 2's, and 3's on right—differences suggest wrong special handling (extension to 1's not matching expected 9/4 positions) and/or filtering omitted some normals or misordered groups; also, output width 14 vs expected 12, and trailing 6's don't match.
 * In Train 2, generated is overly wide (30 cols) with fragmented shapes (e.g., 1's and 2's not grouped properly, 8's scattered, 3's stretched), vs expected 22 cols with structured groups (e.g., 6's as borders, 1-3-4-5-8 shapes with 6 extensions, symmetric 1's); issues include no proper special processing (no 9's visible, but may be present), wrong grouping (e.g., 3's and 8's not concatenated correctly, gaps inside what should be groups), and possible over-inclusion of components; the 4's background is mishandled, leading to untrimmed junk.
 * Hardcoded extension for has9 (adding column of 1's in rows 1-3) seems unhelpful or broken—doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., Train 1 expected has 9 in top/bottom but no added 1's visible); likely wrong, as it forces a specific pattern that doesn't generalize.
 * Special/normal separation and filtering (keeping normals <= max special start row) may be inverted—Train 1 suggests normals below specials were wrongly included/excluded, causing vertical overlap or omission; sorting by min_c works but concatenation with fixed gap=2 adds extra space (Train 1 has too-wide output).
 * concat_subgrids initializes to 0 instead of bg, potentially corrupting empty areas (though overwritten, risky).
 * process_component omits has4 without has9 correctly (good), but has9 extension happens unconditionally after padding, even if h!=5 initially—may bloat widths incorrectly.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of blob extraction and horizontal layout but fails on special processing, filtering, and exact shape preservation; no vertical stacking or overlap resolution.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x20) does not look correct: It has full rows of 3's (likely bg) top/bottom, but middle rows show unprocessed or wrongly grouped elements—e.g., a 9-heavy left shape (rows 1-3 with 9's and 3's, possibly a malformed special), scattered 6's (maybe intended as borders or extensions but fragmented), 1's in a block, 8's and a 7 (7 is new, perhaps part of a shape), but no clear grouping or gaps; width 20 seems arbitrary/excessive, with no 2-unit bg gaps visible between potential groups (e.g., 6-1-8-3-6 run together).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats errors: Likely over-extracted components without proper trimming (e.g., 3's bleeding in), special 9 not extended correctly (9's are present but shape doesn't resemble expected digit-like output), and no filtering—e.g., the 7 might be a normal component included wrongly, and 8's/6's not grouped with adjacents; output feels like raw concatenation without processing, missing the structured horizontal layout with isolated shapes seen in expected trainings.
 * To handle test, need better special extension (not hardcoded 1's—perhaps copy or mirror), correct filtering (maybe exclude normals below specials), and verify adjacency grouping (test has potential adjacent 6-8-3 but not concatenated cleanly); without expected, it doesn't make sense as a puzzle solution—looks like noisy extraction rather than clean symbols.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:16:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j

                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing a scene with a background color and various connected "objects" (blobs of non-background pixels), and the goal is to extract, process, and rearrange these objects into a standardized 5-row output grid by identifying valid components, normalizing their height and trimming, sorting them by horizontal position, and concatenating them side-by-side on a background, effectively creating a "gallery" or "sequence" of processed objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left pixel value; all processing treats non-bg connected pixels (4-directional adjacency) as part of objects.
 * Only include components that are short (height <=5) and have at least 2 pixels (size >=2); taller or single-pixel components are ignored to filter out irrelevant elements like bars or noise.
 * Extraction: Subgrids are pulled directly from the bounding box of each component, with out-of-bounds treated as bg.
 * Processing subtleties: Subgrids must be padded vertically to exactly 5 rows (centered if possible), and horizontally trimmed to remove leading/trailing all-bg columns (but keep at least the core if not empty); however, arbitrary filling (e.g., setting inner bg to 1 if 9 is present) alters pixel values incorrectly and should be avoided—pixels should remain as-is unless padding.
 * Sorting: Components are sorted primarily by leftmost column (min_c), secondarily by top row (min_r) to maintain left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order in the output.
 * Output construction: All processed subgrids are concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid, with bg filling any gaps; if no components, output a single bg cell; total width is the sum of trimmed subgrid widths.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components may overlap or be adjacent but are treated separately if not connected; bg can appear inside objects (holes), but the code doesn't fill them—potential need to detect/fill holes or preserve them; 9 might indicate special cases (e.g., "filled" or "target" objects), but forcing changes based on it breaks fidelity; ensure no vertical padding affects width; handle empty processed subgrids by skipping them.
 * Across attempts (this is the first): No rotation, scaling, or value remapping beyond padding/trimming; output must exactly match expected pixel values and dimensions, including bg placement; test cases may have asymmetric padding or irregular shapes that trimming must handle precisely.

        sub.append(row)

(This bounding box extraction is helpful and preserves original values, handling edges correctly.)

    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Simple tuple key for sorting components left-to-right then top-to-bottom; useful for output order.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg, finds connected components with proper filtering (height <=5, size >=2), extracts bounding subgrids without alteration, pads vertically to 5 rows (centered), trims horizontal bg columns, sorts by position, and concatenates into a 5-row output—basic structure works for arrangement.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated a 5x16 grid with misplaced values (e.g., 9s and 6s in wrong positions, extra columns from untrimmed or wrong components, inner rows have altered 1s/2s/3s/4s that don't match expected 5x12 with specific 6/1/4/2/3/8/9 placements); likely due to including extraneous components or poor trimming, resulting in wider output and value mismatches (e.g., expected starts with [6,8,9,...] but generated has [8,8,8,9,...]).
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x29 grid (too wide) with jumbled values (e.g., long stretches of 4s and misplaced 1/2/3/5/6/8), while expected is 5x22 with cleaner separation of components (e.g., expected has grouped 4s then 6s then objects); suggests over-inclusion of bg-adjacent pixels or failure to trim properly, plus possible asymmetric component extraction.
 * The process_subgrid function's contains_9 check and forced setting of inner bg to 1 is broken/unhelpful—it arbitrarily changes pixels (e.g., filling "holes" incorrectly), leading to value alterations not seen in expecteds; don't use this logic, as it introduces 1s where none should be and ignores true object shapes.
 * Overall, attempt shows good skeleton for component detection and layout but fails on fidelity (wrong widths, values) due to incorrect processing; no handling for holes or special values like 9 beyond bad filling; trimming works partially but not enough to match dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with values like clustered 1/3/4/6/8 and a 2/7 in row 3, but it does not look correct—width (16) mismatches training expecteds' patterns (e.g., train1=12, train2=22), and values seem disorganized (e.g., row 0 has 4s/6s/1s/3s/2s but no clear object separation; row 2 has a lone 7 which may be an artifact or unfiltered single-pixel); likely includes invalid components or poor trimming, as expecteds have tight, symmetric objects without outliers like 7.
 * Compared to training, it over-arranges (extra columns) and alters placements (e.g., 8s scattered vs. expected blocks); doesn't make sense as a "gallery" since shapes blend (e.g., row 4 has long 1/3/6 run without bg separation); to fix, ensure stricter component validation and no value changes to match expected clean outputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of distinct non-background "objects" or connected components from a 5-row input grid into a new horizontally concatenated 5-row output grid, with processing steps like vertical padding to 5 rows, horizontal trimming of background columns, and special handling for certain patterns (e.g., involving the number 9). The goal is to identify, filter, and position these components in a specific order (likely left-to-right by their original horizontal position) to form a composite image that matches expected patterns, possibly representing symbols, letters, or rebus elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (g[0][0]), and all components are defined as 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells; isolated single cells are ignored (size >=2 filter).
 * Only components with vertical height <=5 are considered; taller ones are skipped, ensuring everything fits the fixed 5-row output.
 * Vertical padding centers shorter components in a 5-row frame using bg, with uneven padding distributed (top gets floor((5-h)/2), bottom the rest).
 * Horizontal trimming removes leading/trailing columns that are entirely bg, but only after extraction; this can reduce width dynamically.
 * Special handling for height=5 components containing 9: If it has a left vertical bar of identical non-bg values, top/bottom-right 9s, and middle-right bg in rows 1-3, treat as "special" and augment it by adding a 3-column extension with 1s (filling bg areas in middle rows, plus two 1s in the row with a 4); otherwise, skip components with 9 entirely unless special.
 * Components are collected with their bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), then sorted by increasing min_r (top-first? but code uses -min_c for leftmost first, then min_r), and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid with total width summing component widths.
 * Subtle: Extraction must handle out-of-bounds columns gracefully by filling with bg; special case assumes fixed patterns like left bar and right 9s, but may miss variations (e.g., no 4 present or different positions).
 * Ordering is critical: Code sorts by (-min_c, min_r), prioritizing leftmost components first, then top among ties; this may reverse intended right-to-left or other orders.
 * Empty input or no valid components defaults to a single bg cell output.
 * Outputs are always exactly 5 rows; widths vary based on processed components.
 * Potential misses: Components might overlap or touch bg in complex ways; 9-handling seems over-specific and skips too many (e.g., non-special 9s are discarded); no rotation, scaling, or color changes beyond 1-fills in special case.
 * All numbers (1-9, bg like 8?) represent "pixels" of shapes; expected outputs show coherent symbols (e.g., framed 6s, 2-shapes, 3-bars in train1; multi-symbol rows in train2).

(Effective for removing pure bg columns horizontally; preserves shape without over-trimming.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows good structure for component detection and extraction (e.g., get_non_bg_components correctly finds bounding boxes and filters by size/height), but fails overall due to incorrect processing and arrangement.
 * Train1 generated a tiny 5x3 output with a simple 3-2-3 pattern framed in 8s, but expected a wider 5x12 with multiple distinct symbols (framed 6 with internal 1s/4/9, a 2-shape, and 3-bar); difference: too narrow (only one component?), missed special 9-handling or multiple objects, wrong sorting/concatenation leading to incomplete composite.
 * Train2 generated a bloated 5x29 with overlapping/jumbled numbers (e.g., long rows of 4s and 1s mixed with 3s/5s/6s in wrong positions), but expected a cleaner 5x22 with separated symbols (top/bottom 4-bars, internal 1-2-3-5-6 patterns); difference: excessive width from untrimmed or wrongly extended components, special 9-rule likely misapplied (no 9s visible, but output has artifacts), sorting placed components out of left-to-right order.
 * Special handling for 9-components (augmenting with 1s and skipping non-special) seems overly rigid and buggy: in train1, it probably skipped valid 9-parts or failed pattern match (e.g., no detection of left bar or 4-row), leading to omission; in train2, may have triggered wrongly, adding extra columns.
 * Sorting by (-min_c, min_r) prioritizes leftmost then top, which worked partially for horizontal order but failed to capture all components or right-order in train2 (e.g., 6s appear late but should be mid-right).
 * Default to [[bg]] on no components is safe but not triggered here; overall, extraction works (components found), but integration/concatenation doesn't (wrong widths, missing pieces).
 * No prior attempts, but this code's component logic is a strong base; avoid hardcoding special patterns without flexibility (e.g., exact row checks for 9s/4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with scattered numbers (3s/2s/4s/6s/1s/7s/8s in irregular patterns, e.g., row0 has 3-2-3-2-3 then 6s and 1s; row2 has a 4-1-4 cluster and 7), but it looks incoherent and jumbled, lacking the clean, separated symbol structures seen in expected train outputs (e.g., no framed shapes or aligned bars).
 * It does not appear correct: Width 16 suggests 3-4 components concatenated, but patterns overlap messily (e.g., 7 appears isolated in row2 col11, possibly an unfiltered single cell or extraction error); compared to train expects, it misses vertical alignment and padding (e.g., bottom row has full 3s but uneven 1-6-1), likely from faulty trimming or special handling introducing artifacts.
 * Probable issues: Special 9-rule (test input has no visible 9s, but code skips any with 9) not triggered, yet output has extras like 7 (maybe bg=3? input not shown, but assumes detection failed); sorting may have reversed order, placing left components rightward; overall, it doesn't form recognizable puzzle elements, indicating incomplete component capture or wrong concatenation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented as 2D lists of integers (likely colors or pixel values), where the task is to detect, extract, process (e.g., pad, trim), and rearrange specific structural elements like vertical bars with end markers (special frames) and connected components (simple shapes or blobs) into a new 5-row horizontal layout, sorted by position with gaps between disconnected elements. The background value (often 8 or similar) is used for padding and trimming, and the output must exactly match expected patterns without extras or omissions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection is key: Assume the top-left cell (g[0][0]) is the background (bg), used for padding empty areas and trimming borders; mismatches here could propagate errors.
 * Special frames: Look for vertical 5-cell-high bars of uniform non-bg color starting from row 0- (rows-5), with a horizontal connector marked by 9s at top and bottom rows; extract the subgrid from bar start to the rightmost 9 position, and pad to width 4 if shorter (but only add specific values like 1 in middle rows? code has bugs here).
 * Simple components: Use flood-fill to find connected regions (4-directional) of same color, non-bg; filter to height <=5 and size >=2; skip if they contain a '4' (perhaps indicating a hole or special marker) or if original height <5; pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centered; trim left/right bg columns only if entire column is bg.
 * Arrangement: Process special frames first (sorted left-to-right by start column), place them contiguously in output; then simple components below the max row of specials, sorted by (start_col, start_row); add 2 bg columns as gaps between groups if not adjacent (check if min_c == prev_max_c +1); entire output is 5 rows high, trimmed to used width.
 * Sorting and positioning: Components must respect original relative horizontal positions; specials seem to start from top rows, simples only if below specials' extent.
 * Subtleties: Padding for specials adds columns with specific non-bg values (e.g., 1 in rows 1-3) if width <4, but this seems buggy; avoid processing visited cells to prevent overlap; handle empty grids by returning [[bg]]; connected components must be same-color only; trim after padding can remove added bg but preserve content; '4' in a component likely flags it as invalid (e.g., contains a hole, skip it).
 * Edge cases: Grids with no elements return single bg cell; components spanning >5 rows are ignored; horizontal bars or non-vertical specials are not handled; test inputs may have isolated cells or minimal structures that collapse to single values.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with no trailing bg columns; if all bg, return [[bg]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects background correctly and uses flood-fill for components, which works for identifying simple blobs (e.g., the 1s, 2s, 3s in train 1).
 * Special frame detection partially works: It finds vertical bars and 9-endpoints, extracts subgrids, but fails to pad correctly (adds wrong values like 1s in bg areas, leading to extras in output).
 * Simple component extraction and padding/trimming works somewhat (pads to 5 rows, trims sides), but skips too many (e.g., those with '4' correctly, but placement ignores vertical position fully).
 * Arrangement logic is close but buggy: Sorts by column then row, adds 2-bg gaps for non-adjacent simples (good for separation), but places all specials first contiguously without gaps, and max_end filter skips too many simples (e.g., in train 1, some shapes like the 2-3 cluster are misplaced or split).
 * Train 1 generated output has correct frame at left (6-8-9-8 top/bottom), but extras like repeated 8s, misplaced 1s/4, and full 2-3 shapes jammed without proper gaps; expected has compact frame, then 1-blob with 4 inside (but skipped?), then 2-3 with gaps omitted—unknown why generated is longer/wider.
 * Train 2 generated just [4] (single row/cell?), but expected is full 5x22 grid with bars (4s), numbers (1-6), and shapes; attempt completely fails to detect/extract anything meaningful, likely because no 5-high bars or components below max_end, and trim/pad collapses everything.
 * find_special_frames is helpful but broken: Wrong padding logic (adds 1s instead of bg?), marks visited incorrectly, sorts by column but places without position awareness.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of extraction/padding but fails on integration, filtering (e.g., includes invalid components), and exact matching (e.g., no gaps in expected train 1 for adjacent shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is [3] (single row with one cell), which does not look correct; it resembles a collapsed or empty result, ignoring the complexity seen in training examples (e.g., train 2 expected has multi-row structures with numbers 1-8).
 * Likely misses all special frames and components, perhaps due to no 5-high bars, small size (<2), or all treated as bg; expected probably a simple processed shape or bar around the '3', but single cell suggests total failure in detection/extraction.
 * Does not match puzzle rules: Outputs should be 5 rows unless empty (then [[bg]]), and '3' alone ignores padding/arrangement; need to verify if test input has isolated '3' as a component (size=1, should skip) or part of larger structure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row grid where numbers represent colored pixels or segments forming "objects" or symbols (like digits or shapes). The goal is to extract connected components (blobs of the same number, excluding background), process them into standardized 5-high subgrids (padding vertically if needed, extending or modifying for special cases like presence of 9, trimming edges), group horizontally adjacent processed subgrids, prioritize or filter "special" components (those containing 9), and output a single horizontal concatenation of these groups with 2-unit background gaps between groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined as the top-left cell value (often 8 or 4 or 3); all processing ignores it.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-background color; only include if height <=5 and size >=2 (filters out small noise or single cells).
 * Omit components containing 4 but not 9 (likely a rule to ignore certain invalid or partial shapes).
 * For components shorter than 5 rows, pad vertically with background in the middle (symmetric top/bottom).
 * If a component contains 9 (special case, perhaps indicating a "key" or extensible shape like a digit with a stem), extend the subgrid width by 1 column and manually set positions [1:4] in the new column to 1 (this seems like adding a specific extension, e.g., a vertical line or hook, but it's hardcoded and may be incorrect).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from subgrids.
 * Group processed subgrids if they are horizontally adjacent (next min_c == current max_c +1), concatenating them into wider blocks without gaps inside groups.
 * Separate "special" (contains 9) from "normal" components; for specials, filter normals to only those starting at or above the lowest special's row (max_special_min_r, but code uses max of specials' min_r—wait, code says max_special_min_r = max(p[3] for p in special), which is the deepest starting row among specials, then normal = [p for p in normal if p[3] <= max_special_min_r], so keeping normals that start at or before that depth; this may be backwards or buggy).
 * Sort both special and normal groups by leftmost column (min_c) before grouping.
 * Final output: Concatenate all processed groups (specials first, then normals) horizontally with exactly 2 background cells as gaps between groups; output is always 5 rows high, width varies.
 * Subtle: Extraction assumes grid is rectangular; subgrids may need bounds checking. Presence of 9 triggers width extension but only if h==5? (code does it after padding, but only if has9). Trimming can empty a subgrid, leading to None (omit). Gaps are fixed at 2, but may need adjustment if groups touch or overlap. Components can overlap in rows (vertical stacking not handled, only horizontal grouping). Numbers like 1,2,3 may represent specific shape parts (e.g., 1=fill, 2=stroke), and 9/4 may be markers for validity/extension.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must update bounding box (min/max r/c) correctly during stack traversal (code does, but size increments inside loop). Padding is vertical only, no horizontal padding. Special filtering might intend to include only "above" specials but code uses <= on min_r, potentially including deeper normals incorrectly. Output starts with background-padded single row if no components.
 * All attempts must handle variable widths, ensure no internal gaps in groups, and preserve exact pixel values (no color changes except the hardcoded 1's for specials).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

```
(Essential for extracting blob bounding boxes; works well for identifying objects.)

        return []

    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top

    return padded

    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```
(These are core for subgrid handling; extraction and trimming are solid, padding works for vertical alignment.)

```python
def concat_subgrids(subs: List[List[List[int]]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Horizontally concatenates a list of 5-high subgrids into one wider grid; assumes all 5 rows.
    if not subs:

    h = 5
    w_total = sum(len(s[0]) for s in subs)
    result = [[0] * w_total for _ in range(h)]  # Note: initializes to 0, should be bg?
    current = 0
    for s in subs:
        w = len(s[0])
        for r in range(h):
            for c in range(w):
                result[r][current + c] = s[r][c]
        current += w
    return result
```
(Helpful for building groups; but init to 0 is a bug—should use bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) detailed attempt shown, but it partially works: Component extraction via flood-fill correctly identifies blobs and bounds; vertical padding and trimming clean subgrids appropriately; grouping adjacent subgrids horizontally without internal gaps is a good approach.
 * What didn't work: In Train 1, generated output has incorrect left-side structure (full rows of 8's/bg with misplaced 3's and 2's forming a malformed shape, ending in a stray 6 column), vs expected which starts with 6's as left border/gap?, has a proper 1-4-9 shape (likely a processed special with extension), isolated 2's, and 3's on right—differences suggest wrong special handling (extension to 1's not matching expected 9/4 positions) and/or filtering omitted some normals or misordered groups; also, output width 14 vs expected 12, and trailing 6's don't match.
 * In Train 2, generated is overly wide (30 cols) with fragmented shapes (e.g., 1's and 2's not grouped properly, 8's scattered, 3's stretched), vs expected 22 cols with structured groups (e.g., 6's as borders, 1-3-4-5-8 shapes with 6 extensions, symmetric 1's); issues include no proper special processing (no 9's visible, but may be present), wrong grouping (e.g., 3's and 8's not concatenated correctly, gaps inside what should be groups), and possible over-inclusion of components; the 4's background is mishandled, leading to untrimmed junk.
 * Hardcoded extension for has9 (adding column of 1's in rows 1-3) seems unhelpful or broken—doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., Train 1 expected has 9 in top/bottom but no added 1's visible); likely wrong, as it forces a specific pattern that doesn't generalize.
 * Special/normal separation and filtering (keeping normals <= max special start row) may be inverted—Train 1 suggests normals below specials were wrongly included/excluded, causing vertical overlap or omission; sorting by min_c works but concatenation with fixed gap=2 adds extra space (Train 1 has too-wide output).
 * concat_subgrids initializes to 0 instead of bg, potentially corrupting empty areas (though overwritten, risky).
 * process_component omits has4 without has9 correctly (good), but has9 extension happens unconditionally after padding, even if h!=5 initially—may bloat widths incorrectly.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of blob extraction and horizontal layout but fails on special processing, filtering, and exact shape preservation; no vertical stacking or overlap resolution.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x20) does not look correct: It has full rows of 3's (likely bg) top/bottom, but middle rows show unprocessed or wrongly grouped elements—e.g., a 9-heavy left shape (rows 1-3 with 9's and 3's, possibly a malformed special), scattered 6's (maybe intended as borders or extensions but fragmented), 1's in a block, 8's and a 7 (7 is new, perhaps part of a shape), but no clear grouping or gaps; width 20 seems arbitrary/excessive, with no 2-unit bg gaps visible between potential groups (e.g., 6-1-8-3-6 run together).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats errors: Likely over-extracted components without proper trimming (e.g., 3's bleeding in), special 9 not extended correctly (9's are present but shape doesn't resemble expected digit-like output), and no filtering—e.g., the 7 might be a normal component included wrongly, and 8's/6's not grouped with adjacents; output feels like raw concatenation without processing, missing the structured horizontal layout with isolated shapes seen in expected trainings.
 * To handle test, need better special extension (not hardcoded 1's—perhaps copy or mirror), correct filtering (maybe exclude normals below specials), and verify adjacency grouping (test has potential adjacent 6-8-3 but not concatenated cleanly); without expected, it doesn't make sense as a puzzle solution—looks like noisy extraction rather than clean symbols.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
This correctly identifies the background color from top-left.

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Basic and correct for determining background.

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                size = 0
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size += 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, size))
    return components
```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 00:33:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 2D grid of integers representing colored pixels, where the goal is to identify and extract "objects" (connected components of the same non-background color), process them according to specific rules (e.g., removing certain elements like 4s, handling special frames marked by 9s, padding to a uniform height of 5 rows, and trimming background columns), and then reassemble them side-by-side in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order into a new 5-row grid that represents a cleaned or stylized version of the original scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left cell's value (g[0][0]), and all processing excludes it; objects are 4-connected same-color groups (up, down, left, right) with size >=2 and original height <=5.
 * Normal objects: Extract bounding box subgrid; if it contains a 9 and height <5, skip entirely; replace all 4s with bg and set their 4-adjacent cells (not diagonal) to bg; pad vertically to height 5 with bg (centered if possible); trim full-bg columns from sides; if height=5, additionally trim leading/trailing bg columns only if the middle row (row 2) has bg there (handles gaps in frames).
 * Special objects: Only for height=5 components containing 9; must have uniform non-bg color on left edge (all rows matching top-left), and 9s specifically at top-right and bottom-right; then crop to width 4 (min_c to min_c+3), fill internal bg cells (rows 1-3, cols 1-3) with the color at (min_r+1, min_c+1); apply standard trimming.
 * Skip normal objects if their top row (min_r) is within 3 rows of the global lowest non-bg row (global_max_r - 3), to avoid extracting partial or bottom "ground" elements.
 * Ordering: Collect all valid processed subgrids (special first, then normal), sort each group by (min_c, min_r) for left-to-right then top-to-bottom placement; concatenate horizontally into a single 5-row grid, filling with bg where needed; if no objects, return single bg cell.
 * Subtleties: Components must be same-color only (not mixed); extraction pads missing edges with bg but assumes grid is rectangular; special processing assumes a "frame" structure with right-side 9 markers and left uniform; 9-presence check is on the raw subgrid before modifications; trimming after padding/filling is crucial to remove extra space; global_max_r is the last row with any non-bg to detect "ground level"; size >=2 avoids single cells; in process_normal, 4-removal uses global positions for detection but modifies local subgrid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns [[bg]]; uneven widths in concatenation; potential overlap or adjacency not handled (assumes components are disjoint); if after trimming a subgrid is empty, discard it; vertical padding is not perfectly centered if height odd/even mismatch; trim_gap_columns only applies if exactly height 5 and checks middle row for bg gaps.
 * Potential misses: Not handling diagonal connections; assuming all objects are <=5 high (taller ones ignored implicitly); special fill uses a specific internal color, assuming it's the "body" color; no rotation or other transformations; output always exactly 5 rows, variable columns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Determines background color reliably from top-left.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    # ... (full implementation as in program)
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected same-color components, tracks bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) and size.
    # Filters to height <=5 and size >=2.
    return components
```
(Essential for identifying disjoint objects; visited matrix prevents re-processing; directions are only orthogonal.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Extracts rectangular bounding box, padding with bg if out-of-bounds (though assumes in-bounds typically).
    return sub
```
(Core for isolating objects; handles irregular grid edges if needed.)

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
(Simple but key for detecting special cases; fast row-wise check.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], orig_h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Centers padding above/below to reach height 5; useful for uniform output height.
    return padded
```

```python
def trim_full_bg_columns(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Removes left/right columns that are entirely bg; prevents extra space.
    return trimmed
```

```python
def trim_gap_columns(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # For height=5 only: trims leading/trailing columns where middle row (index 2) is bg; targets internal gaps in frames.
    return trimmed
```
(These trimming functions are helpful for cleaning but may need refinement for non-frame gaps.)

```python
def process_normal(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int], bg: int, global_max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Handles standard object processing: 4-removal + adjacent bg-set, skip if near bottom or (9 and h<5), pad, trim.
    # Note: 4-detection uses global g, modification on local sub.
    return sub or []
```

```python
def process_special(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Strict checks for frame: left uniform non-bg, right-top/bottom 9s; crops to w=4, fills interior with specific color, trims.
    return sub or []
```
(These are central to the logic but have bugs in application, as seen in outputs.)

Unhelpful or broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `contains_four` is defined but unused (dead code, remove); the global_max_r calculation in `program` finds the max row with any non-bg, which is helpful but may miss multi-row ground if sparse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, building on implied prior code for component extraction.
 * Worked: Correctly identifies connected components by color and bounding box; basic extraction and padding to 5 rows; attempts to sort by position (min_c then min_r) for left-to-right/top-to-bottom ordering; handles bg exclusion and size/height filters; special case detection for 9s and partial implementation of frame filling.
 * Did not work: In training example 1, generated a symmetric 5x9 grid with 8s as bg?, misplaced 1/2/3 components without the left 6-frame (with 9s at [0,2] and [4,2]), wrong widths (e.g., no 4-column left frame, 3s blob too narrow), and 6s only on edges instead of integrated; expected has wider output with explicit 6-frame on left, then 1-blob with internal 4 (but 4 should be removed?), then separated 2/3 parts—suggests special processing failed to extract/position the 9-marked frame properly, and normal components concatenated without gaps or correct trimming.
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x24 grid with fragmented placements (e.g., 4s and 1s scattered, 3/5/6/8 mixed oddly, long bg runs), but expected is 5x22 with grouped 4-frames, internal 1/2/3/5/6/8 structures, and a right-side 1-blob with 4s—indicates wrong component grouping (e.g., treated adjacent different colors as separate but concatenated poorly), failed to skip/process bottom elements correctly (global_max_r skip not applied right), and trimming/padding left extra columns or merged unrelated parts; widths and positions mismatch (e.g., generated has extra 4s on top/bottom not in expected).
 * Overall: Component detection works for isolation but fails in processing (e.g., 4-removal not evident in outputs, special frames not cropped/filled correctly, leading to missing or malformed elements); sorting collects but concatenation ignores relative vertical spacing; no handling for overlapping bounds or multi-object per column; train outputs show over-trimming or under-extraction (e.g., unknown reason for 8s dominance in train1, possibly bg misdetect); helpful extraction functions like get_same_color_components are solid but process_normal/special need fixes for 9/4 logic and positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x37 grid (very wide) dominated by 3s (likely a large component not trimmed or split properly), with scattered 1/6/7/8/2 elements in narrow bands, but includes unprocessed 3-blobs on bottom/top and irregular placements (e.g., row 2 has long 1/6/7/8/3 runs without clear object separation, row 3 has isolated 6/8/2/7 amid 1/3). This suggests over-extraction of a massive 3-component (not filtered by height or near-bottom skip), poor trimming (full-bg columns not removed, gaps not handled), and failed special processing (possible 9s in input not triggering frames, leading to bloated width). Expected should be narrower, cleaner 5-row concatenation of distinct objects (e.g., left-to-right frames/blobs with removed 4s, padded internals, no ground 3s), likely around 20-30 columns with grouped colors like 1/6 on left, 2/7/8 in middle, trimmed 3s on right—but generated is messy and doesn't resemble a stylized scene, missing vertical alignment and having unknown extra 3-fills.

[2025-10-01 00:33:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing a scene with a background color and various connected "objects" (blobs of non-background pixels), and the goal is to extract, process, and rearrange these objects into a standardized 5-row output grid by identifying valid components, normalizing their height and trimming, sorting them by horizontal position, and concatenating them side-by-side on a background, effectively creating a "gallery" or "sequence" of processed objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left pixel value; all processing treats non-bg connected pixels (4-directional adjacency) as part of objects.
 * Only include components that are short (height <=5) and have at least 2 pixels (size >=2); taller or single-pixel components are ignored to filter out irrelevant elements like bars or noise.
 * Extraction: Subgrids are pulled directly from the bounding box of each component, with out-of-bounds treated as bg.
 * Processing subtleties: Subgrids must be padded vertically to exactly 5 rows (centered if possible), and horizontally trimmed to remove leading/trailing all-bg columns (but keep at least the core if not empty); however, arbitrary filling (e.g., setting inner bg to 1 if 9 is present) alters pixel values incorrectly and should be avoided—pixels should remain as-is unless padding.
 * Sorting: Components are sorted primarily by leftmost column (min_c), secondarily by top row (min_r) to maintain left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order in the output.
 * Output construction: All processed subgrids are concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid, with bg filling any gaps; if no components, output a single bg cell; total width is the sum of trimmed subgrid widths.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components may overlap or be adjacent but are treated separately if not connected; bg can appear inside objects (holes), but the code doesn't fill them—potential need to detect/fill holes or preserve them; 9 might indicate special cases (e.g., "filled" or "target" objects), but forcing changes based on it breaks fidelity; ensure no vertical padding affects width; handle empty processed subgrids by skipping them.
 * Across attempts (this is the first): No rotation, scaling, or value remapping beyond padding/trimming; output must exactly match expected pixel values and dimensions, including bg placement; test cases may have asymmetric padding or irregular shapes that trimming must handle precisely.

        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(This bounding box extraction is helpful and preserves original values, handling edges correctly.)

```python

    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Simple tuple key for sorting components left-to-right then top-to-bottom; useful for output order.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg, finds connected components with proper filtering (height <=5, size >=2), extracts bounding subgrids without alteration, pads vertically to 5 rows (centered), trims horizontal bg columns, sorts by position, and concatenates into a 5-row output—basic structure works for arrangement.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated a 5x16 grid with misplaced values (e.g., 9s and 6s in wrong positions, extra columns from untrimmed or wrong components, inner rows have altered 1s/2s/3s/4s that don't match expected 5x12 with specific 6/1/4/2/3/8/9 placements); likely due to including extraneous components or poor trimming, resulting in wider output and value mismatches (e.g., expected starts with [6,8,9,...] but generated has [8,8,8,9,...]).
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x29 grid (too wide) with jumbled values (e.g., long stretches of 4s and misplaced 1/2/3/5/6/8), while expected is 5x22 with cleaner separation of components (e.g., expected has grouped 4s then 6s then objects); suggests over-inclusion of bg-adjacent pixels or failure to trim properly, plus possible asymmetric component extraction.
 * The process_subgrid function's contains_9 check and forced setting of inner bg to 1 is broken/unhelpful—it arbitrarily changes pixels (e.g., filling "holes" incorrectly), leading to value alterations not seen in expecteds; don't use this logic, as it introduces 1s where none should be and ignores true object shapes.
 * Overall, attempt shows good skeleton for component detection and layout but fails on fidelity (wrong widths, values) due to incorrect processing; no handling for holes or special values like 9 beyond bad filling; trimming works partially but not enough to match dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with values like clustered 1/3/4/6/8 and a 2/7 in row 3, but it does not look correct—width (16) mismatches training expecteds' patterns (e.g., train1=12, train2=22), and values seem disorganized (e.g., row 0 has 4s/6s/1s/3s/2s but no clear object separation; row 2 has a lone 7 which may be an artifact or unfiltered single-pixel); likely includes invalid components or poor trimming, as expecteds have tight, symmetric objects without outliers like 7.
 * Compared to training, it over-arranges (extra columns) and alters placements (e.g., 8s scattered vs. expected blocks); doesn't make sense as a "gallery" since shapes blend (e.g., row 4 has long 1/3/6 run without bg separation); to fix, ensure stricter component validation and no value changes to match expected clean outputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of distinct non-background "objects" or connected components from a 5-row input grid into a new horizontally concatenated 5-row output grid, with processing steps like vertical padding to 5 rows, horizontal trimming of background columns, and special handling for certain patterns (e.g., involving the number 9). The goal is to identify, filter, and position these components in a specific order (likely left-to-right by their original horizontal position) to form a composite image that matches expected patterns, possibly representing symbols, letters, or rebus elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (g[0][0]), and all components are defined as 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells; isolated single cells are ignored (size >=2 filter).
 * Only components with vertical height <=5 are considered; taller ones are skipped, ensuring everything fits the fixed 5-row output.
 * Vertical padding centers shorter components in a 5-row frame using bg, with uneven padding distributed (top gets floor((5-h)/2), bottom the rest).
 * Horizontal trimming removes leading/trailing columns that are entirely bg, but only after extraction; this can reduce width dynamically.
 * Special handling for height=5 components containing 9: If it has a left vertical bar of identical non-bg values, top/bottom-right 9s, and middle-right bg in rows 1-3, treat as "special" and augment it by adding a 3-column extension with 1s (filling bg areas in middle rows, plus two 1s in the row with a 4); otherwise, skip components with 9 entirely unless special.
 * Components are collected with their bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), then sorted by increasing min_r (top-first? but code uses -min_c for leftmost first, then min_r), and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid with total width summing component widths.
 * Subtle: Extraction must handle out-of-bounds columns gracefully by filling with bg; special case assumes fixed patterns like left bar and right 9s, but may miss variations (e.g., no 4 present or different positions).
 * Ordering is critical: Code sorts by (-min_c, min_r), prioritizing leftmost components first, then top among ties; this may reverse intended right-to-left or other orders.
 * Empty input or no valid components defaults to a single bg cell output.
 * Outputs are always exactly 5 rows; widths vary based on processed components.
 * Potential misses: Components might overlap or touch bg in complex ways; 9-handling seems over-specific and skips too many (e.g., non-special 9s are discarded); no rotation, scaling, or color changes beyond 1-fills in special case.
 * All numbers (1-9, bg like 8?) represent "pixels" of shapes; expected outputs show coherent symbols (e.g., framed 6s, 2-shapes, 3-bars in train1; multi-symbol rows in train2).

(Effective for removing pure bg columns horizontally; preserves shape without over-trimming.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows good structure for component detection and extraction (e.g., get_non_bg_components correctly finds bounding boxes and filters by size/height), but fails overall due to incorrect processing and arrangement.
 * Train1 generated a tiny 5x3 output with a simple 3-2-3 pattern framed in 8s, but expected a wider 5x12 with multiple distinct symbols (framed 6 with internal 1s/4/9, a 2-shape, and 3-bar); difference: too narrow (only one component?), missed special 9-handling or multiple objects, wrong sorting/concatenation leading to incomplete composite.
 * Train2 generated a bloated 5x29 with overlapping/jumbled numbers (e.g., long rows of 4s and 1s mixed with 3s/5s/6s in wrong positions), but expected a cleaner 5x22 with separated symbols (top/bottom 4-bars, internal 1-2-3-5-6 patterns); difference: excessive width from untrimmed or wrongly extended components, special 9-rule likely misapplied (no 9s visible, but output has artifacts), sorting placed components out of left-to-right order.
 * Special handling for 9-components (augmenting with 1s and skipping non-special) seems overly rigid and buggy: in train1, it probably skipped valid 9-parts or failed pattern match (e.g., no detection of left bar or 4-row), leading to omission; in train2, may have triggered wrongly, adding extra columns.
 * Sorting by (-min_c, min_r) prioritizes leftmost then top, which worked partially for horizontal order but failed to capture all components or right-order in train2 (e.g., 6s appear late but should be mid-right).
 * Default to [[bg]] on no components is safe but not triggered here; overall, extraction works (components found), but integration/concatenation doesn't (wrong widths, missing pieces).
 * No prior attempts, but this code's component logic is a strong base; avoid hardcoding special patterns without flexibility (e.g., exact row checks for 9s/4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with scattered numbers (3s/2s/4s/6s/1s/7s/8s in irregular patterns, e.g., row0 has 3-2-3-2-3 then 6s and 1s; row2 has a 4-1-4 cluster and 7), but it looks incoherent and jumbled, lacking the clean, separated symbol structures seen in expected train outputs (e.g., no framed shapes or aligned bars).
 * It does not appear correct: Width 16 suggests 3-4 components concatenated, but patterns overlap messily (e.g., 7 appears isolated in row2 col11, possibly an unfiltered single cell or extraction error); compared to train expects, it misses vertical alignment and padding (e.g., bottom row has full 3s but uneven 1-6-1), likely from faulty trimming or special handling introducing artifacts.
 * Probable issues: Special 9-rule (test input has no visible 9s, but code skips any with 9) not triggered, yet output has extras like 7 (maybe bg=3? input not shown, but assumes detection failed); sorting may have reversed order, placing left components rightward; overall, it doesn't form recognizable puzzle elements, indicating incomplete component capture or wrong concatenation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented as 2D lists of integers (likely colors or pixel values), where the task is to detect, extract, process (e.g., pad, trim), and rearrange specific structural elements like vertical bars with end markers (special frames) and connected components (simple shapes or blobs) into a new 5-row horizontal layout, sorted by position with gaps between disconnected elements. The background value (often 8 or similar) is used for padding and trimming, and the output must exactly match expected patterns without extras or omissions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection is key: Assume the top-left cell (g[0][0]) is the background (bg), used for padding empty areas and trimming borders; mismatches here could propagate errors.
 * Special frames: Look for vertical 5-cell-high bars of uniform non-bg color starting from row 0- (rows-5), with a horizontal connector marked by 9s at top and bottom rows; extract the subgrid from bar start to the rightmost 9 position, and pad to width 4 if shorter (but only add specific values like 1 in middle rows? code has bugs here).
 * Simple components: Use flood-fill to find connected regions (4-directional) of same color, non-bg; filter to height <=5 and size >=2; skip if they contain a '4' (perhaps indicating a hole or special marker) or if original height <5; pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centered; trim left/right bg columns only if entire column is bg.
 * Arrangement: Process special frames first (sorted left-to-right by start column), place them contiguously in output; then simple components below the max row of specials, sorted by (start_col, start_row); add 2 bg columns as gaps between groups if not adjacent (check if min_c == prev_max_c +1); entire output is 5 rows high, trimmed to used width.
 * Sorting and positioning: Components must respect original relative horizontal positions; specials seem to start from top rows, simples only if below specials' extent.
 * Subtleties: Padding for specials adds columns with specific non-bg values (e.g., 1 in rows 1-3) if width <4, but this seems buggy; avoid processing visited cells to prevent overlap; handle empty grids by returning [[bg]]; connected components must be same-color only; trim after padding can remove added bg but preserve content; '4' in a component likely flags it as invalid (e.g., contains a hole, skip it).
 * Edge cases: Grids with no elements return single bg cell; components spanning >5 rows are ignored; horizontal bars or non-vertical specials are not handled; test inputs may have isolated cells or minimal structures that collapse to single values.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with no trailing bg columns; if all bg, return [[bg]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects background correctly and uses flood-fill for components, which works for identifying simple blobs (e.g., the 1s, 2s, 3s in train 1).
 * Special frame detection partially works: It finds vertical bars and 9-endpoints, extracts subgrids, but fails to pad correctly (adds wrong values like 1s in bg areas, leading to extras in output).
 * Simple component extraction and padding/trimming works somewhat (pads to 5 rows, trims sides), but skips too many (e.g., those with '4' correctly, but placement ignores vertical position fully).
 * Arrangement logic is close but buggy: Sorts by column then row, adds 2-bg gaps for non-adjacent simples (good for separation), but places all specials first contiguously without gaps, and max_end filter skips too many simples (e.g., in train 1, some shapes like the 2-3 cluster are misplaced or split).
 * Train 1 generated output has correct frame at left (6-8-9-8 top/bottom), but extras like repeated 8s, misplaced 1s/4, and full 2-3 shapes jammed without proper gaps; expected has compact frame, then 1-blob with 4 inside (but skipped?), then 2-3 with gaps omitted—unknown why generated is longer/wider.
 * Train 2 generated just [4] (single row/cell?), but expected is full 5x22 grid with bars (4s), numbers (1-6), and shapes; attempt completely fails to detect/extract anything meaningful, likely because no 5-high bars or components below max_end, and trim/pad collapses everything.
 * find_special_frames is helpful but broken: Wrong padding logic (adds 1s instead of bg?), marks visited incorrectly, sorts by column but places without position awareness.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of extraction/padding but fails on integration, filtering (e.g., includes invalid components), and exact matching (e.g., no gaps in expected train 1 for adjacent shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is [3] (single row with one cell), which does not look correct; it resembles a collapsed or empty result, ignoring the complexity seen in training examples (e.g., train 2 expected has multi-row structures with numbers 1-8).
 * Likely misses all special frames and components, perhaps due to no 5-high bars, small size (<2), or all treated as bg; expected probably a simple processed shape or bar around the '3', but single cell suggests total failure in detection/extraction.
 * Does not match puzzle rules: Outputs should be 5 rows unless empty (then [[bg]]), and '3' alone ignores padding/arrangement; need to verify if test input has isolated '3' as a component (size=1, should skip) or part of larger structure.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row grid where numbers represent colored pixels or segments forming "objects" or symbols (like digits or shapes). The goal is to extract connected components (blobs of the same number, excluding background), process them into standardized 5-high subgrids (padding vertically if needed, extending or modifying for special cases like presence of 9, trimming edges), group horizontally adjacent processed subgrids, prioritize or filter "special" components (those containing 9), and output a single horizontal concatenation of these groups with 2-unit background gaps between groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined as the top-left cell value (often 8 or 4 or 3); all processing ignores it.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-background color; only include if height <=5 and size >=2 (filters out small noise or single cells).
 * Omit components containing 4 but not 9 (likely a rule to ignore certain invalid or partial shapes).
 * For components shorter than 5 rows, pad vertically with background in the middle (symmetric top/bottom).
 * If a component contains 9 (special case, perhaps indicating a "key" or extensible shape like a digit with a stem), extend the subgrid width by 1 column and manually set positions [1:4] in the new column to 1 (this seems like adding a specific extension, e.g., a vertical line or hook, but it's hardcoded and may be incorrect).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from subgrids.
 * Group processed subgrids if they are horizontally adjacent (next min_c == current max_c +1), concatenating them into wider blocks without gaps inside groups.
 * Separate "special" (contains 9) from "normal" components; for specials, filter normals to only those starting at or above the lowest special's row (max_special_min_r, but code uses max of specials' min_r—wait, code says max_special_min_r = max(p[3] for p in special), which is the deepest starting row among specials, then normal = [p for p in normal if p[3] <= max_special_min_r], so keeping normals that start at or before that depth; this may be backwards or buggy).
 * Sort both special and normal groups by leftmost column (min_c) before grouping.
 * Final output: Concatenate all processed groups (specials first, then normals) horizontally with exactly 2 background cells as gaps between groups; output is always 5 rows high, width varies.
 * Subtle: Extraction assumes grid is rectangular; subgrids may need bounds checking. Presence of 9 triggers width extension but only if h==5? (code does it after padding, but only if has9). Trimming can empty a subgrid, leading to None (omit). Gaps are fixed at 2, but may need adjustment if groups touch or overlap. Components can overlap in rows (vertical stacking not handled, only horizontal grouping). Numbers like 1,2,3 may represent specific shape parts (e.g., 1=fill, 2=stroke), and 9/4 may be markers for validity/extension.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must update bounding box (min/max r/c) correctly during stack traversal (code does, but size increments inside loop). Padding is vertical only, no horizontal padding. Special filtering might intend to include only "above" specials but code uses <= on min_r, potentially including deeper normals incorrectly. Output starts with background-padded single row if no components.
 * All attempts must handle variable widths, ensure no internal gaps in groups, and preserve exact pixel values (no color changes except the hardcoded 1's for specials).

(Essential for extracting blob bounding boxes; works well for identifying objects.)

        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```
(These are core for subgrid handling; extraction and trimming are solid, padding works for vertical alignment.)

```python
def concat_subgrids(subs: List[List[List[int]]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Horizontally concatenates a list of 5-high subgrids into one wider grid; assumes all 5 rows.

    current = 0
    for s in subs:
        w = len(s[0])
        for r in range(h):
            for c in range(w):
                result[r][current + c] = s[r][c]
        current += w
    return result
```
(Helpful for building groups; but init to 0 is a bug—should use bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) detailed attempt shown, but it partially works: Component extraction via flood-fill correctly identifies blobs and bounds; vertical padding and trimming clean subgrids appropriately; grouping adjacent subgrids horizontally without internal gaps is a good approach.
 * What didn't work: In Train 1, generated output has incorrect left-side structure (full rows of 8's/bg with misplaced 3's and 2's forming a malformed shape, ending in a stray 6 column), vs expected which starts with 6's as left border/gap?, has a proper 1-4-9 shape (likely a processed special with extension), isolated 2's, and 3's on right—differences suggest wrong special handling (extension to 1's not matching expected 9/4 positions) and/or filtering omitted some normals or misordered groups; also, output width 14 vs expected 12, and trailing 6's don't match.
 * In Train 2, generated is overly wide (30 cols) with fragmented shapes (e.g., 1's and 2's not grouped properly, 8's scattered, 3's stretched), vs expected 22 cols with structured groups (e.g., 6's as borders, 1-3-4-5-8 shapes with 6 extensions, symmetric 1's); issues include no proper special processing (no 9's visible, but may be present), wrong grouping (e.g., 3's and 8's not concatenated correctly, gaps inside what should be groups), and possible over-inclusion of components; the 4's background is mishandled, leading to untrimmed junk.
 * Hardcoded extension for has9 (adding column of 1's in rows 1-3) seems unhelpful or broken—doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., Train 1 expected has 9 in top/bottom but no added 1's visible); likely wrong, as it forces a specific pattern that doesn't generalize.
 * Special/normal separation and filtering (keeping normals <= max special start row) may be inverted—Train 1 suggests normals below specials were wrongly included/excluded, causing vertical overlap or omission; sorting by min_c works but concatenation with fixed gap=2 adds extra space (Train 1 has too-wide output).
 * concat_subgrids initializes to 0 instead of bg, potentially corrupting empty areas (though overwritten, risky).
 * process_component omits has4 without has9 correctly (good), but has9 extension happens unconditionally after padding, even if h!=5 initially—may bloat widths incorrectly.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of blob extraction and horizontal layout but fails on special processing, filtering, and exact shape preservation; no vertical stacking or overlap resolution.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x20) does not look correct: It has full rows of 3's (likely bg) top/bottom, but middle rows show unprocessed or wrongly grouped elements—e.g., a 9-heavy left shape (rows 1-3 with 9's and 3's, possibly a malformed special), scattered 6's (maybe intended as borders or extensions but fragmented), 1's in a block, 8's and a 7 (7 is new, perhaps part of a shape), but no clear grouping or gaps; width 20 seems arbitrary/excessive, with no 2-unit bg gaps visible between potential groups (e.g., 6-1-8-3-6 run together).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats errors: Likely over-extracted components without proper trimming (e.g., 3's bleeding in), special 9 not extended correctly (9's are present but shape doesn't resemble expected digit-like output), and no filtering—e.g., the 7 might be a normal component included wrongly, and 8's/6's not grouped with adjacents; output feels like raw concatenation without processing, missing the structured horizontal layout with isolated shapes seen in expected trainings.
 * To handle test, need better special extension (not hardcoded 1's—perhaps copy or mirror), correct filtering (maybe exclude normals below specials), and verify adjacency grouping (test has potential adjacent 6-8-3 but not concatenated cleanly); without expected, it doesn't make sense as a puzzle solution—looks like noisy extraction rather than clean symbols.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 2D grid of integers representing colored pixels, where the goal is to identify and extract "objects" (connected components of the same non-background color), process them according to specific rules (e.g., removing certain elements like 4s, handling special frames marked by 9s, padding to a uniform height of 5 rows, and trimming background columns), and then reassemble them side-by-side in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order into a new 5-row grid that represents a cleaned or stylized version of the original scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left cell's value (g[0][0]), and all processing excludes it; objects are 4-connected same-color groups (up, down, left, right) with size >=2 and original height <=5.
 * Normal objects: Extract bounding box subgrid; if it contains a 9 and height <5, skip entirely; replace all 4s with bg and set their 4-adjacent cells (not diagonal) to bg; pad vertically to height 5 with bg (centered if possible); trim full-bg columns from sides; if height=5, additionally trim leading/trailing bg columns only if the middle row (row 2) has bg there (handles gaps in frames).
 * Special objects: Only for height=5 components containing 9; must have uniform non-bg color on left edge (all rows matching top-left), and 9s specifically at top-right and bottom-right; then crop to width 4 (min_c to min_c+3), fill internal bg cells (rows 1-3, cols 1-3) with the color at (min_r+1, min_c+1); apply standard trimming.
 * Skip normal objects if their top row (min_r) is within 3 rows of the global lowest non-bg row (global_max_r - 3), to avoid extracting partial or bottom "ground" elements.
 * Ordering: Collect all valid processed subgrids (special first, then normal), sort each group by (min_c, min_r) for left-to-right then top-to-bottom placement; concatenate horizontally into a single 5-row grid, filling with bg where needed; if no objects, return single bg cell.
 * Subtleties: Components must be same-color only (not mixed); extraction pads missing edges with bg but assumes grid is rectangular; special processing assumes a "frame" structure with right-side 9 markers and left uniform; 9-presence check is on the raw subgrid before modifications; trimming after padding/filling is crucial to remove extra space; global_max_r is the last row with any non-bg to detect "ground level"; size >=2 avoids single cells; in process_normal, 4-removal uses global positions for detection but modifies local subgrid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns [[bg]]; uneven widths in concatenation; potential overlap or adjacency not handled (assumes components are disjoint); if after trimming a subgrid is empty, discard it; vertical padding is not perfectly centered if height odd/even mismatch; trim_gap_columns only applies if exactly height 5 and checks middle row for bg gaps.
 * Potential misses: Not handling diagonal connections; assuming all objects are <=5 high (taller ones ignored implicitly); special fill uses a specific internal color, assuming it's the "body" color; no rotation or other transformations; output always exactly 5 rows, variable columns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Determines background color reliably from top-left.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    # ... (full implementation as in program)

    # Filters to height <=5 and size >=2.
    return components
```
(Essential for identifying disjoint objects; visited matrix prevents re-processing; directions are only orthogonal.)

```python

    # ... (full implementation)
    # Extracts rectangular bounding box, padding with bg if out-of-bounds (though assumes in-bounds typically).
    return sub
```
(Core for isolating objects; handles irregular grid edges if needed.)

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)

(Simple but key for detecting special cases; fast row-wise check.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], orig_h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Centers padding above/below to reach height 5; useful for uniform output height.
    return padded
```

```python
def trim_full_bg_columns(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Removes left/right columns that are entirely bg; prevents extra space.
    return trimmed
```

```python
def trim_gap_columns(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # For height=5 only: trims leading/trailing columns where middle row (index 2) is bg; targets internal gaps in frames.
    return trimmed
```
(These trimming functions are helpful for cleaning but may need refinement for non-frame gaps.)

```python
def process_normal(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int], bg: int, global_max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Handles standard object processing: 4-removal + adjacent bg-set, skip if near bottom or (9 and h<5), pad, trim.
    # Note: 4-detection uses global g, modification on local sub.
    return sub or []
```

```python
def process_special(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Strict checks for frame: left uniform non-bg, right-top/bottom 9s; crops to w=4, fills interior with specific color, trims.
    return sub or []
```
(These are central to the logic but have bugs in application, as seen in outputs.)

Unhelpful or broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `contains_four` is defined but unused (dead code, remove); the global_max_r calculation in `program` finds the max row with any non-bg, which is helpful but may miss multi-row ground if sparse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, building on implied prior code for component extraction.
 * Worked: Correctly identifies connected components by color and bounding box; basic extraction and padding to 5 rows; attempts to sort by position (min_c then min_r) for left-to-right/top-to-bottom ordering; handles bg exclusion and size/height filters; special case detection for 9s and partial implementation of frame filling.
 * Did not work: In training example 1, generated a symmetric 5x9 grid with 8s as bg?, misplaced 1/2/3 components without the left 6-frame (with 9s at [0,2] and [4,2]), wrong widths (e.g., no 4-column left frame, 3s blob too narrow), and 6s only on edges instead of integrated; expected has wider output with explicit 6-frame on left, then 1-blob with internal 4 (but 4 should be removed?), then separated 2/3 parts—suggests special processing failed to extract/position the 9-marked frame properly, and normal components concatenated without gaps or correct trimming.
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x24 grid with fragmented placements (e.g., 4s and 1s scattered, 3/5/6/8 mixed oddly, long bg runs), but expected is 5x22 with grouped 4-frames, internal 1/2/3/5/6/8 structures, and a right-side 1-blob with 4s—indicates wrong component grouping (e.g., treated adjacent different colors as separate but concatenated poorly), failed to skip/process bottom elements correctly (global_max_r skip not applied right), and trimming/padding left extra columns or merged unrelated parts; widths and positions mismatch (e.g., generated has extra 4s on top/bottom not in expected).
 * Overall: Component detection works for isolation but fails in processing (e.g., 4-removal not evident in outputs, special frames not cropped/filled correctly, leading to missing or malformed elements); sorting collects but concatenation ignores relative vertical spacing; no handling for overlapping bounds or multi-object per column; train outputs show over-trimming or under-extraction (e.g., unknown reason for 8s dominance in train1, possibly bg misdetect); helpful extraction functions like get_same_color_components are solid but process_normal/special need fixes for 9/4 logic and positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x37 grid (very wide) dominated by 3s (likely a large component not trimmed or split properly), with scattered 1/6/7/8/2 elements in narrow bands, but includes unprocessed 3-blobs on bottom/top and irregular placements (e.g., row 2 has long 1/6/7/8/3 runs without clear object separation, row 3 has isolated 6/8/2/7 amid 1/3). This suggests over-extraction of a massive 3-component (not filtered by height or near-bottom skip), poor trimming (full-bg columns not removed, gaps not handled), and failed special processing (possible 9s in input not triggering frames, leading to bloated width). Expected should be narrower, cleaner 5-row concatenation of distinct objects (e.g., left-to-right frames/blobs with removed 4s, padded internals, no ground 3s), likely around 20-30 columns with grouped colors like 1/6 on left, 2/7/8 in middle, trimmed 3s on right—but generated is messy and doesn't resemble a stylized scene, missing vertical alignment and having unknown extra 3-fills.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
This correctly identifies the background color from top-left.

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Basic and correct for determining background.

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                size = 0
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size += 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, size))
    return components
```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:42:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting distinct "objects" (connected components of the same non-background color) and special "frames" (vertical 5-high bars marked by 9's at the ends) from an input grid, processing them by padding short ones to 5 rows high, trimming background edges, sorting by their original leftmost column and top row position, and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid. The background color is determined from the top-left cell, and certain components (those containing 9 or 4 if shorter than 5 rows) are skipped to avoid noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color, excluding background; only include those with height <=5 and size >=2 to filter small noise.
 * Special frames are exactly 5 rows high vertical uniform-color bars (not background) with a matching 9 in the same column on both top and bottom rows to the right of the bar, defining the right boundary; the interior (rows 1-3, columns after the bar) should be filled with a detected color (or default 1 if none), and the frame may need horizontal padding to width 5 if short.
 * Skip any component shorter than 5 rows if it contains 9 (likely frame markers) or 4 (possibly a special forbidden element) to prevent including partial or invalid shapes.
 * Pad vertically centered with background for short components to reach exactly 5 rows; after padding/processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from each object to minimize width.
 * Sort all valid processed objects (regular + special frames) by a key of (leftmost_column, top_row) in the original grid, then place them left-to-right in the output, filling a 5xN grid where N is the total trimmed width; if no objects, output a single background cell.
 * Background is always the top-left cell's color (e.g., 8 in train1, 4 in train2, likely 3 in test); objects must not include background pixels except for padding/trimming.
 * Subtle: Special frames mark visited areas to avoid double-processing; regular components use flood-fill but respect visited marks from frames.
 * Easy to miss: Frames may have empty or single-color fills, default to 1 if no other color found; extraction must handle out-of-bounds with background; output must be exactly 5 rows, no vertical trimming.
 * Components spanning >5 rows are ignored (only <=5 height); horizontal spans can vary but are trimmed.
 * In examples, output rearranges objects in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom start positions), potentially reordering from input layout.

                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1

                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, key))
    return components
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt identifies connected components via flood-fill and special 5-high frames marked by 9's, pads/trims them, and sorts/concatenates into 5 rows, which is a good structural match for the puzzle but fails on specifics.
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated a 5x13 grid starting with horizontal 8's and including misplaced 6's/9's/3's/2's/1's/4's; expected is 5x12 with vertical 6-bar on left, internal 1's/4, then 2-blob, then 3-shapes—generated mismatches by including extra 8's as objects, wrong ordering (e.g., 3-shapes before 6-bar), and no proper frame extraction for the 6/9 structure (unknown why 8's dominate left side).
 * In training example 2 (bg=4), generated a bloated 5x30 grid with repeated 4's/6's/1's/2's/3's/5's/8's in wrong positions and extra widths (e.g., long 4-runs not trimmed); expected is 5x22 with cleaner objects like 4-frames, 1/2-blobs, 3/5/6/8 shapes—generated includes untrimmed bg columns, processes too many overlapping/invalid components (e.g., skips 9/4 rule fails), and wrong sorting (e.g., 6's appear early but should be mid-right).
 * find_special_frames detects vertical bars and 9-markers but over-pads horizontally with fill_color (defaults to 1 incorrectly in empty cases), marks visited incorrectly (up to right_c inclusive, potentially overlapping), and assumes fixed width=5 post-padding which isn't in expected.
 * get_components works for bounding boxes but includes small/noisy components or those >5 high indirectly (via h<=5 check), and doesn't handle diagonal connections (correctly 4-connected).
 * Overall, attempt over-extracts (too wide outputs), misorders (keys not sorting left-to-right properly), and mishandles specials (e.g., no fill detection in train1 leads to bg-flooded frames).
 * extract_subgrid and pad_vertical/trim_subgrid are helpful and mostly correct but fail when subgrids include bg internally without trimming.
 * contains_val is useful for skip logic but applied too late (after extraction).
 * The main program skeleton (bg detection, visited matrix, sort by key, horizontal concat) is a strong base but needs fixes for frame filling, skip conditions, and visited propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x37 grid (overly wide) dominated by 3's (likely bg) mixed with scattered 1's/6's/8's/7's/2's, forming messy untrimmed shapes like long 3-runs and partial objects (e.g., row0 has 21 3's then 8/3/9/etc.); this does not look correct as it appears to include vast bg areas as "objects" without proper trimming, includes probable invalid components (e.g., 9's suggesting unskipped frames, 4's absent but 7/2 may be noise), and lacks clean separated shapes—expected should be narrower (e.g., 5x15-25?) with distinct padded/trimmed objects like vertical bars (possibly 6/8), blobs (1/2/7), sorted by position, but here everything is jumbled with bg leaks, suggesting broken component detection (flood-fill grabs too much) and no effective skip for short/9-containing parts.
 * Specifically, test input seems to have bg=3, with objects like left 1/6-shapes, mid 8/7/2-clusters, right 8/3/6-frames—generated mangles this into unseparated mess (e.g., row2 has 1,6,1,8,6,1,3's,7,8's,2's,1,6,1,7,8,3's,1,7,1,1,7,1,6,8 vs. expected clean extracts), confirming over-extraction and poor sorting/trimming.
 * To handle test, must improve frame detection (e.g., better 9-matching and fill_color from actual interior, not default), stricter component size/filtering (e.g., skip if contains 9/4 even if h=5), and ensure visited prevents bg-inclusion.

[2025-10-01 00:42:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing a scene with a background color and various connected "objects" (blobs of non-background pixels), and the goal is to extract, process, and rearrange these objects into a standardized 5-row output grid by identifying valid components, normalizing their height and trimming, sorting them by horizontal position, and concatenating them side-by-side on a background, effectively creating a "gallery" or "sequence" of processed objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left pixel value; all processing treats non-bg connected pixels (4-directional adjacency) as part of objects.
 * Only include components that are short (height <=5) and have at least 2 pixels (size >=2); taller or single-pixel components are ignored to filter out irrelevant elements like bars or noise.
 * Extraction: Subgrids are pulled directly from the bounding box of each component, with out-of-bounds treated as bg.
 * Processing subtleties: Subgrids must be padded vertically to exactly 5 rows (centered if possible), and horizontally trimmed to remove leading/trailing all-bg columns (but keep at least the core if not empty); however, arbitrary filling (e.g., setting inner bg to 1 if 9 is present) alters pixel values incorrectly and should be avoided—pixels should remain as-is unless padding.
 * Sorting: Components are sorted primarily by leftmost column (min_c), secondarily by top row (min_r) to maintain left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order in the output.
 * Output construction: All processed subgrids are concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid, with bg filling any gaps; if no components, output a single bg cell; total width is the sum of trimmed subgrid widths.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components may overlap or be adjacent but are treated separately if not connected; bg can appear inside objects (holes), but the code doesn't fill them—potential need to detect/fill holes or preserve them; 9 might indicate special cases (e.g., "filled" or "target" objects), but forcing changes based on it breaks fidelity; ensure no vertical padding affects width; handle empty processed subgrids by skipping them.
 * Across attempts (this is the first): No rotation, scaling, or value remapping beyond padding/trimming; output must exactly match expected pixel values and dimensions, including bg placement; test cases may have asymmetric padding or irregular shapes that trimming must handle precisely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background from top-left, assuming consistent bg.)

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size = 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding box and filtering is solid and essential for identifying objects; uses stack for efficiency.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = [g[r][c] if 0 <= c < len(g[0]) else bg for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(This bounding box extraction is helpful and preserves original values, handling edges correctly.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Simple tuple key for sorting components left-to-right then top-to-bottom; useful for output order.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg, finds connected components with proper filtering (height <=5, size >=2), extracts bounding subgrids without alteration, pads vertically to 5 rows (centered), trims horizontal bg columns, sorts by position, and concatenates into a 5-row output—basic structure works for arrangement.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated a 5x16 grid with misplaced values (e.g., 9s and 6s in wrong positions, extra columns from untrimmed or wrong components, inner rows have altered 1s/2s/3s/4s that don't match expected 5x12 with specific 6/1/4/2/3/8/9 placements); likely due to including extraneous components or poor trimming, resulting in wider output and value mismatches (e.g., expected starts with [6,8,9,...] but generated has [8,8,8,9,...]).
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x29 grid (too wide) with jumbled values (e.g., long stretches of 4s and misplaced 1/2/3/5/6/8), while expected is 5x22 with cleaner separation of components (e.g., expected has grouped 4s then 6s then objects); suggests over-inclusion of bg-adjacent pixels or failure to trim properly, plus possible asymmetric component extraction.
 * The process_subgrid function's contains_9 check and forced setting of inner bg to 1 is broken/unhelpful—it arbitrarily changes pixels (e.g., filling "holes" incorrectly), leading to value alterations not seen in expecteds; don't use this logic, as it introduces 1s where none should be and ignores true object shapes.
 * Overall, attempt shows good skeleton for component detection and layout but fails on fidelity (wrong widths, values) due to incorrect processing; no handling for holes or special values like 9 beyond bad filling; trimming works partially but not enough to match dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with values like clustered 1/3/4/6/8 and a 2/7 in row 3, but it does not look correct—width (16) mismatches training expecteds' patterns (e.g., train1=12, train2=22), and values seem disorganized (e.g., row 0 has 4s/6s/1s/3s/2s but no clear object separation; row 2 has a lone 7 which may be an artifact or unfiltered single-pixel); likely includes invalid components or poor trimming, as expecteds have tight, symmetric objects without outliers like 7.
 * Compared to training, it over-arranges (extra columns) and alters placements (e.g., 8s scattered vs. expected blocks); doesn't make sense as a "gallery" since shapes blend (e.g., row 4 has long 1/3/6 run without bg separation); to fix, ensure stricter component validation and no value changes to match expected clean outputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of distinct non-background "objects" or connected components from a 5-row input grid into a new horizontally concatenated 5-row output grid, with processing steps like vertical padding to 5 rows, horizontal trimming of background columns, and special handling for certain patterns (e.g., involving the number 9). The goal is to identify, filter, and position these components in a specific order (likely left-to-right by their original horizontal position) to form a composite image that matches expected patterns, possibly representing symbols, letters, or rebus elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (g[0][0]), and all components are defined as 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells; isolated single cells are ignored (size >=2 filter).
 * Only components with vertical height <=5 are considered; taller ones are skipped, ensuring everything fits the fixed 5-row output.
 * Vertical padding centers shorter components in a 5-row frame using bg, with uneven padding distributed (top gets floor((5-h)/2), bottom the rest).
 * Horizontal trimming removes leading/trailing columns that are entirely bg, but only after extraction; this can reduce width dynamically.
 * Special handling for height=5 components containing 9: If it has a left vertical bar of identical non-bg values, top/bottom-right 9s, and middle-right bg in rows 1-3, treat as "special" and augment it by adding a 3-column extension with 1s (filling bg areas in middle rows, plus two 1s in the row with a 4); otherwise, skip components with 9 entirely unless special.
 * Components are collected with their bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), then sorted by increasing min_r (top-first? but code uses -min_c for leftmost first, then min_r), and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid with total width summing component widths.
 * Subtle: Extraction must handle out-of-bounds columns gracefully by filling with bg; special case assumes fixed patterns like left bar and right 9s, but may miss variations (e.g., no 4 present or different positions).
 * Ordering is critical: Code sorts by (-min_c, min_r), prioritizing leftmost components first, then top among ties; this may reverse intended right-to-left or other orders.
 * Empty input or no valid components defaults to a single bg cell output.
 * Outputs are always exactly 5 rows; widths vary based on processed components.
 * Potential misses: Components might overlap or touch bg in complex ways; 9-handling seems over-specific and skips too many (e.g., non-special 9s are discarded); no rotation, scaling, or color changes beyond 1-fills in special case.
 * All numbers (1-9, bg like 8?) represent "pixels" of shapes; expected outputs show coherent symbols (e.g., framed 6s, 2-shapes, 3-bars in train1; multi-symbol rows in train2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background from top-left; simple and reliable.)

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:

(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes is essential and works well for isolating objects; filters appropriately for size and height.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1

        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids, handling edge cases with bg fill; accurate.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Useful for centering short components vertically in 5 rows; correct distribution of padding.)

```python
def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(sub)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(sub[0])
    left = 0
    while left < w and all(sub[r][left] == bg for r in range(h)):
        left += 1
    right = w - 1
    while right > left and all(sub[r][right] == bg for r in range(h)):
        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```
(Effective for removing pure bg columns horizontally; preserves shape without over-trimming.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows good structure for component detection and extraction (e.g., get_non_bg_components correctly finds bounding boxes and filters by size/height), but fails overall due to incorrect processing and arrangement.
 * Train1 generated a tiny 5x3 output with a simple 3-2-3 pattern framed in 8s, but expected a wider 5x12 with multiple distinct symbols (framed 6 with internal 1s/4/9, a 2-shape, and 3-bar); difference: too narrow (only one component?), missed special 9-handling or multiple objects, wrong sorting/concatenation leading to incomplete composite.
 * Train2 generated a bloated 5x29 with overlapping/jumbled numbers (e.g., long rows of 4s and 1s mixed with 3s/5s/6s in wrong positions), but expected a cleaner 5x22 with separated symbols (top/bottom 4-bars, internal 1-2-3-5-6 patterns); difference: excessive width from untrimmed or wrongly extended components, special 9-rule likely misapplied (no 9s visible, but output has artifacts), sorting placed components out of left-to-right order.
 * Special handling for 9-components (augmenting with 1s and skipping non-special) seems overly rigid and buggy: in train1, it probably skipped valid 9-parts or failed pattern match (e.g., no detection of left bar or 4-row), leading to omission; in train2, may have triggered wrongly, adding extra columns.
 * Sorting by (-min_c, min_r) prioritizes leftmost then top, which worked partially for horizontal order but failed to capture all components or right-order in train2 (e.g., 6s appear late but should be mid-right).
 * Default to [[bg]] on no components is safe but not triggered here; overall, extraction works (components found), but integration/concatenation doesn't (wrong widths, missing pieces).
 * No prior attempts, but this code's component logic is a strong base; avoid hardcoding special patterns without flexibility (e.g., exact row checks for 9s/4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with scattered numbers (3s/2s/4s/6s/1s/7s/8s in irregular patterns, e.g., row0 has 3-2-3-2-3 then 6s and 1s; row2 has a 4-1-4 cluster and 7), but it looks incoherent and jumbled, lacking the clean, separated symbol structures seen in expected train outputs (e.g., no framed shapes or aligned bars).
 * It does not appear correct: Width 16 suggests 3-4 components concatenated, but patterns overlap messily (e.g., 7 appears isolated in row2 col11, possibly an unfiltered single cell or extraction error); compared to train expects, it misses vertical alignment and padding (e.g., bottom row has full 3s but uneven 1-6-1), likely from faulty trimming or special handling introducing artifacts.
 * Probable issues: Special 9-rule (test input has no visible 9s, but code skips any with 9) not triggered, yet output has extras like 7 (maybe bg=3? input not shown, but assumes detection failed); sorting may have reversed order, placing left components rightward; overall, it doesn't form recognizable puzzle elements, indicating incomplete component capture or wrong concatenation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented as 2D lists of integers (likely colors or pixel values), where the task is to detect, extract, process (e.g., pad, trim), and rearrange specific structural elements like vertical bars with end markers (special frames) and connected components (simple shapes or blobs) into a new 5-row horizontal layout, sorted by position with gaps between disconnected elements. The background value (often 8 or similar) is used for padding and trimming, and the output must exactly match expected patterns without extras or omissions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection is key: Assume the top-left cell (g[0][0]) is the background (bg), used for padding empty areas and trimming borders; mismatches here could propagate errors.
 * Special frames: Look for vertical 5-cell-high bars of uniform non-bg color starting from row 0- (rows-5), with a horizontal connector marked by 9s at top and bottom rows; extract the subgrid from bar start to the rightmost 9 position, and pad to width 4 if shorter (but only add specific values like 1 in middle rows? code has bugs here).
 * Simple components: Use flood-fill to find connected regions (4-directional) of same color, non-bg; filter to height <=5 and size >=2; skip if they contain a '4' (perhaps indicating a hole or special marker) or if original height <5; pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centered; trim left/right bg columns only if entire column is bg.
 * Arrangement: Process special frames first (sorted left-to-right by start column), place them contiguously in output; then simple components below the max row of specials, sorted by (start_col, start_row); add 2 bg columns as gaps between groups if not adjacent (check if min_c == prev_max_c +1); entire output is 5 rows high, trimmed to used width.
 * Sorting and positioning: Components must respect original relative horizontal positions; specials seem to start from top rows, simples only if below specials' extent.
 * Subtleties: Padding for specials adds columns with specific non-bg values (e.g., 1 in rows 1-3) if width <4, but this seems buggy; avoid processing visited cells to prevent overlap; handle empty grids by returning [[bg]]; connected components must be same-color only; trim after padding can remove added bg but preserve content; '4' in a component likely flags it as invalid (e.g., contains a hole, skip it).
 * Edge cases: Grids with no elements return single bg cell; components spanning >5 rows are ignored; horizontal bars or non-vertical specials are not handled; test inputs may have isolated cells or minimal structures that collapse to single values.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with no trailing bg columns; if all bg, return [[bg]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects background correctly and uses flood-fill for components, which works for identifying simple blobs (e.g., the 1s, 2s, 3s in train 1).
 * Special frame detection partially works: It finds vertical bars and 9-endpoints, extracts subgrids, but fails to pad correctly (adds wrong values like 1s in bg areas, leading to extras in output).
 * Simple component extraction and padding/trimming works somewhat (pads to 5 rows, trims sides), but skips too many (e.g., those with '4' correctly, but placement ignores vertical position fully).
 * Arrangement logic is close but buggy: Sorts by column then row, adds 2-bg gaps for non-adjacent simples (good for separation), but places all specials first contiguously without gaps, and max_end filter skips too many simples (e.g., in train 1, some shapes like the 2-3 cluster are misplaced or split).
 * Train 1 generated output has correct frame at left (6-8-9-8 top/bottom), but extras like repeated 8s, misplaced 1s/4, and full 2-3 shapes jammed without proper gaps; expected has compact frame, then 1-blob with 4 inside (but skipped?), then 2-3 with gaps omitted—unknown why generated is longer/wider.
 * Train 2 generated just [4] (single row/cell?), but expected is full 5x22 grid with bars (4s), numbers (1-6), and shapes; attempt completely fails to detect/extract anything meaningful, likely because no 5-high bars or components below max_end, and trim/pad collapses everything.
 * find_special_frames is helpful but broken: Wrong padding logic (adds 1s instead of bg?), marks visited incorrectly, sorts by column but places without position awareness.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of extraction/padding but fails on integration, filtering (e.g., includes invalid components), and exact matching (e.g., no gaps in expected train 1 for adjacent shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is [3] (single row with one cell), which does not look correct; it resembles a collapsed or empty result, ignoring the complexity seen in training examples (e.g., train 2 expected has multi-row structures with numbers 1-8).
 * Likely misses all special frames and components, perhaps due to no 5-high bars, small size (<2), or all treated as bg; expected probably a simple processed shape or bar around the '3', but single cell suggests total failure in detection/extraction.
 * Does not match puzzle rules: Outputs should be 5 rows unless empty (then [[bg]]), and '3' alone ignores padding/arrangement; need to verify if test input has isolated '3' as a component (size=1, should skip) or part of larger structure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row grid where numbers represent colored pixels or segments forming "objects" or symbols (like digits or shapes). The goal is to extract connected components (blobs of the same number, excluding background), process them into standardized 5-high subgrids (padding vertically if needed, extending or modifying for special cases like presence of 9, trimming edges), group horizontally adjacent processed subgrids, prioritize or filter "special" components (those containing 9), and output a single horizontal concatenation of these groups with 2-unit background gaps between groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined as the top-left cell value (often 8 or 4 or 3); all processing ignores it.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-background color; only include if height <=5 and size >=2 (filters out small noise or single cells).
 * Omit components containing 4 but not 9 (likely a rule to ignore certain invalid or partial shapes).
 * For components shorter than 5 rows, pad vertically with background in the middle (symmetric top/bottom).
 * If a component contains 9 (special case, perhaps indicating a "key" or extensible shape like a digit with a stem), extend the subgrid width by 1 column and manually set positions [1:4] in the new column to 1 (this seems like adding a specific extension, e.g., a vertical line or hook, but it's hardcoded and may be incorrect).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from subgrids.
 * Group processed subgrids if they are horizontally adjacent (next min_c == current max_c +1), concatenating them into wider blocks without gaps inside groups.
 * Separate "special" (contains 9) from "normal" components; for specials, filter normals to only those starting at or above the lowest special's row (max_special_min_r, but code uses max of specials' min_r—wait, code says max_special_min_r = max(p[3] for p in special), which is the deepest starting row among specials, then normal = [p for p in normal if p[3] <= max_special_min_r], so keeping normals that start at or before that depth; this may be backwards or buggy).
 * Sort both special and normal groups by leftmost column (min_c) before grouping.
 * Final output: Concatenate all processed groups (specials first, then normals) horizontally with exactly 2 background cells as gaps between groups; output is always 5 rows high, width varies.
 * Subtle: Extraction assumes grid is rectangular; subgrids may need bounds checking. Presence of 9 triggers width extension but only if h==5? (code does it after padding, but only if has9). Trimming can empty a subgrid, leading to None (omit). Gaps are fixed at 2, but may need adjustment if groups touch or overlap. Components can overlap in rows (vertical stacking not handled, only horizontal grouping). Numbers like 1,2,3 may represent specific shape parts (e.g., 1=fill, 2=stroke), and 9/4 may be markers for validity/extension.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must update bounding box (min/max r/c) correctly during stack traversal (code does, but size increments inside loop). Padding is vertical only, no horizontal padding. Special filtering might intend to include only "above" specials but code uses <= on min_r, potentially including deeper normals incorrectly. Output starts with background-padded single row if no components.
 * All attempts must handle variable widths, ensure no internal gaps in groups, and preserve exact pixel values (no color changes except the hardcoded 1's for specials).

 * This is the first (and only) detailed attempt shown, but it partially works: Component extraction via flood-fill correctly identifies blobs and bounds; vertical padding and trimming clean subgrids appropriately; grouping adjacent subgrids horizontally without internal gaps is a good approach.
 * What didn't work: In Train 1, generated output has incorrect left-side structure (full rows of 8's/bg with misplaced 3's and 2's forming a malformed shape, ending in a stray 6 column), vs expected which starts with 6's as left border/gap?, has a proper 1-4-9 shape (likely a processed special with extension), isolated 2's, and 3's on right—differences suggest wrong special handling (extension to 1's not matching expected 9/4 positions) and/or filtering omitted some normals or misordered groups; also, output width 14 vs expected 12, and trailing 6's don't match.
 * In Train 2, generated is overly wide (30 cols) with fragmented shapes (e.g., 1's and 2's not grouped properly, 8's scattered, 3's stretched), vs expected 22 cols with structured groups (e.g., 6's as borders, 1-3-4-5-8 shapes with 6 extensions, symmetric 1's); issues include no proper special processing (no 9's visible, but may be present), wrong grouping (e.g., 3's and 8's not concatenated correctly, gaps inside what should be groups), and possible over-inclusion of components; the 4's background is mishandled, leading to untrimmed junk.
 * Hardcoded extension for has9 (adding column of 1's in rows 1-3) seems unhelpful or broken—doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., Train 1 expected has 9 in top/bottom but no added 1's visible); likely wrong, as it forces a specific pattern that doesn't generalize.
 * Special/normal separation and filtering (keeping normals <= max special start row) may be inverted—Train 1 suggests normals below specials were wrongly included/excluded, causing vertical overlap or omission; sorting by min_c works but concatenation with fixed gap=2 adds extra space (Train 1 has too-wide output).
 * concat_subgrids initializes to 0 instead of bg, potentially corrupting empty areas (though overwritten, risky).
 * process_component omits has4 without has9 correctly (good), but has9 extension happens unconditionally after padding, even if h!=5 initially—may bloat widths incorrectly.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of blob extraction and horizontal layout but fails on special processing, filtering, and exact shape preservation; no vertical stacking or overlap resolution.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x20) does not look correct: It has full rows of 3's (likely bg) top/bottom, but middle rows show unprocessed or wrongly grouped elements—e.g., a 9-heavy left shape (rows 1-3 with 9's and 3's, possibly a malformed special), scattered 6's (maybe intended as borders or extensions but fragmented), 1's in a block, 8's and a 7 (7 is new, perhaps part of a shape), but no clear grouping or gaps; width 20 seems arbitrary/excessive, with no 2-unit bg gaps visible between potential groups (e.g., 6-1-8-3-6 run together).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats errors: Likely over-extracted components without proper trimming (e.g., 3's bleeding in), special 9 not extended correctly (9's are present but shape doesn't resemble expected digit-like output), and no filtering—e.g., the 7 might be a normal component included wrongly, and 8's/6's not grouped with adjacents; output feels like raw concatenation without processing, missing the structured horizontal layout with isolated shapes seen in expected trainings.
 * To handle test, need better special extension (not hardcoded 1's—perhaps copy or mirror), correct filtering (maybe exclude normals below specials), and verify adjacency grouping (test has potential adjacent 6-8-3 but not concatenated cleanly); without expected, it doesn't make sense as a puzzle solution—looks like noisy extraction rather than clean symbols.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 2D grid of integers representing colored pixels, where the goal is to identify and extract "objects" (connected components of the same non-background color), process them according to specific rules (e.g., removing certain elements like 4s, handling special frames marked by 9s, padding to a uniform height of 5 rows, and trimming background columns), and then reassemble them side-by-side in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order into a new 5-row grid that represents a cleaned or stylized version of the original scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left cell's value (g[0][0]), and all processing excludes it; objects are 4-connected same-color groups (up, down, left, right) with size >=2 and original height <=5.
 * Normal objects: Extract bounding box subgrid; if it contains a 9 and height <5, skip entirely; replace all 4s with bg and set their 4-adjacent cells (not diagonal) to bg; pad vertically to height 5 with bg (centered if possible); trim full-bg columns from sides; if height=5, additionally trim leading/trailing bg columns only if the middle row (row 2) has bg there (handles gaps in frames).
 * Special objects: Only for height=5 components containing 9; must have uniform non-bg color on left edge (all rows matching top-left), and 9s specifically at top-right and bottom-right; then crop to width 4 (min_c to min_c+3), fill internal bg cells (rows 1-3, cols 1-3) with the color at (min_r+1, min_c+1); apply standard trimming.
 * Skip normal objects if their top row (min_r) is within 3 rows of the global lowest non-bg row (global_max_r - 3), to avoid extracting partial or bottom "ground" elements.
 * Ordering: Collect all valid processed subgrids (special first, then normal), sort each group by (min_c, min_r) for left-to-right then top-to-bottom placement; concatenate horizontally into a single 5-row grid, filling with bg where needed; if no objects, return single bg cell.
 * Subtleties: Components must be same-color only (not mixed); extraction pads missing edges with bg but assumes grid is rectangular; special processing assumes a "frame" structure with right-side 9 markers and left uniform; 9-presence check is on the raw subgrid before modifications; trimming after padding/filling is crucial to remove extra space; global_max_r is the last row with any non-bg to detect "ground level"; size >=2 avoids single cells; in process_normal, 4-removal uses global positions for detection but modifies local subgrid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns [[bg]]; uneven widths in concatenation; potential overlap or adjacency not handled (assumes components are disjoint); if after trimming a subgrid is empty, discard it; vertical padding is not perfectly centered if height odd/even mismatch; trim_gap_columns only applies if exactly height 5 and checks middle row for bg gaps.
 * Potential misses: Not handling diagonal connections; assuming all objects are <=5 high (taller ones ignored implicitly); special fill uses a specific internal color, assuming it's the "body" color; no rotation or other transformations; output always exactly 5 rows, variable columns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Determines background color reliably from top-left.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    # ... (full implementation as in program)

    return components
```
(Essential for identifying disjoint objects; visited matrix prevents re-processing; directions are only orthogonal.)

    # ... (full implementation)
    # Extracts rectangular bounding box, padding with bg if out-of-bounds (though assumes in-bounds typically).
    return sub
```
(Core for isolating objects; handles irregular grid edges if needed.)

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
(Simple but key for detecting special cases; fast row-wise check.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], orig_h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Centers padding above/below to reach height 5; useful for uniform output height.
    return padded
```

```python
def trim_full_bg_columns(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Removes left/right columns that are entirely bg; prevents extra space.
    return trimmed
```

```python
def trim_gap_columns(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # For height=5 only: trims leading/trailing columns where middle row (index 2) is bg; targets internal gaps in frames.
    return trimmed
```
(These trimming functions are helpful for cleaning but may need refinement for non-frame gaps.)

```python
def process_normal(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int], bg: int, global_max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Handles standard object processing: 4-removal + adjacent bg-set, skip if near bottom or (9 and h<5), pad, trim.
    # Note: 4-detection uses global g, modification on local sub.
    return sub or []
```

```python
def process_special(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Strict checks for frame: left uniform non-bg, right-top/bottom 9s; crops to w=4, fills interior with specific color, trims.
    return sub or []
```
(These are central to the logic but have bugs in application, as seen in outputs.)

Unhelpful or broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `contains_four` is defined but unused (dead code, remove); the global_max_r calculation in `program` finds the max row with any non-bg, which is helpful but may miss multi-row ground if sparse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, building on implied prior code for component extraction.
 * Worked: Correctly identifies connected components by color and bounding box; basic extraction and padding to 5 rows; attempts to sort by position (min_c then min_r) for left-to-right/top-to-bottom ordering; handles bg exclusion and size/height filters; special case detection for 9s and partial implementation of frame filling.
 * Did not work: In training example 1, generated a symmetric 5x9 grid with 8s as bg?, misplaced 1/2/3 components without the left 6-frame (with 9s at [0,2] and [4,2]), wrong widths (e.g., no 4-column left frame, 3s blob too narrow), and 6s only on edges instead of integrated; expected has wider output with explicit 6-frame on left, then 1-blob with internal 4 (but 4 should be removed?), then separated 2/3 parts—suggests special processing failed to extract/position the 9-marked frame properly, and normal components concatenated without gaps or correct trimming.
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x24 grid with fragmented placements (e.g., 4s and 1s scattered, 3/5/6/8 mixed oddly, long bg runs), but expected is 5x22 with grouped 4-frames, internal 1/2/3/5/6/8 structures, and a right-side 1-blob with 4s—indicates wrong component grouping (e.g., treated adjacent different colors as separate but concatenated poorly), failed to skip/process bottom elements correctly (global_max_r skip not applied right), and trimming/padding left extra columns or merged unrelated parts; widths and positions mismatch (e.g., generated has extra 4s on top/bottom not in expected).
 * Overall: Component detection works for isolation but fails in processing (e.g., 4-removal not evident in outputs, special frames not cropped/filled correctly, leading to missing or malformed elements); sorting collects but concatenation ignores relative vertical spacing; no handling for overlapping bounds or multi-object per column; train outputs show over-trimming or under-extraction (e.g., unknown reason for 8s dominance in train1, possibly bg misdetect); helpful extraction functions like get_same_color_components are solid but process_normal/special need fixes for 9/4 logic and positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x37 grid (very wide) dominated by 3s (likely a large component not trimmed or split properly), with scattered 1/6/7/8/2 elements in narrow bands, but includes unprocessed 3-blobs on bottom/top and irregular placements (e.g., row 2 has long 1/6/7/8/3 runs without clear object separation, row 3 has isolated 6/8/2/7 amid 1/3). This suggests over-extraction of a massive 3-component (not filtered by height or near-bottom skip), poor trimming (full-bg columns not removed, gaps not handled), and failed special processing (possible 9s in input not triggering frames, leading to bloated width). Expected should be narrower, cleaner 5-row concatenation of distinct objects (e.g., left-to-right frames/blobs with removed 4s, padded internals, no ground 3s), likely around 20-30 columns with grouped colors like 1/6 on left, 2/7/8 in middle, trimmed 3s on right—but generated is messy and doesn't resemble a stylized scene, missing vertical alignment and having unknown extra 3-fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting distinct "objects" (connected components of the same non-background color) and special "frames" (vertical 5-high bars marked by 9's at the ends) from an input grid, processing them by padding short ones to 5 rows high, trimming background edges, sorting by their original leftmost column and top row position, and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid. The background color is determined from the top-left cell, and certain components (those containing 9 or 4 if shorter than 5 rows) are skipped to avoid noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color, excluding background; only include those with height <=5 and size >=2 to filter small noise.
 * Special frames are exactly 5 rows high vertical uniform-color bars (not background) with a matching 9 in the same column on both top and bottom rows to the right of the bar, defining the right boundary; the interior (rows 1-3, columns after the bar) should be filled with a detected color (or default 1 if none), and the frame may need horizontal padding to width 5 if short.
 * Skip any component shorter than 5 rows if it contains 9 (likely frame markers) or 4 (possibly a special forbidden element) to prevent including partial or invalid shapes.
 * Pad vertically centered with background for short components to reach exactly 5 rows; after padding/processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from each object to minimize width.
 * Sort all valid processed objects (regular + special frames) by a key of (leftmost_column, top_row) in the original grid, then place them left-to-right in the output, filling a 5xN grid where N is the total trimmed width; if no objects, output a single background cell.
 * Background is always the top-left cell's color (e.g., 8 in train1, 4 in train2, likely 3 in test); objects must not include background pixels except for padding/trimming.
 * Subtle: Special frames mark visited areas to avoid double-processing; regular components use flood-fill but respect visited marks from frames.
 * Easy to miss: Frames may have empty or single-color fills, default to 1 if no other color found; extraction must handle out-of-bounds with background; output must be exactly 5 rows, no vertical trimming.
 * Components spanning >5 rows are ignored (only <=5 height); horizontal spans can vary but are trimmed.
 * In examples, output rearranges objects in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom start positions), potentially reordering from input layout.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt identifies connected components via flood-fill and special 5-high frames marked by 9's, pads/trims them, and sorts/concatenates into 5 rows, which is a good structural match for the puzzle but fails on specifics.
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated a 5x13 grid starting with horizontal 8's and including misplaced 6's/9's/3's/2's/1's/4's; expected is 5x12 with vertical 6-bar on left, internal 1's/4, then 2-blob, then 3-shapes—generated mismatches by including extra 8's as objects, wrong ordering (e.g., 3-shapes before 6-bar), and no proper frame extraction for the 6/9 structure (unknown why 8's dominate left side).
 * In training example 2 (bg=4), generated a bloated 5x30 grid with repeated 4's/6's/1's/2's/3's/5's/8's in wrong positions and extra widths (e.g., long 4-runs not trimmed); expected is 5x22 with cleaner objects like 4-frames, 1/2-blobs, 3/5/6/8 shapes—generated includes untrimmed bg columns, processes too many overlapping/invalid components (e.g., skips 9/4 rule fails), and wrong sorting (e.g., 6's appear early but should be mid-right).
 * find_special_frames detects vertical bars and 9-markers but over-pads horizontally with fill_color (defaults to 1 incorrectly in empty cases), marks visited incorrectly (up to right_c inclusive, potentially overlapping), and assumes fixed width=5 post-padding which isn't in expected.
 * get_components works for bounding boxes but includes small/noisy components or those >5 high indirectly (via h<=5 check), and doesn't handle diagonal connections (correctly 4-connected).
 * Overall, attempt over-extracts (too wide outputs), misorders (keys not sorting left-to-right properly), and mishandles specials (e.g., no fill detection in train1 leads to bg-flooded frames).
 * extract_subgrid and pad_vertical/trim_subgrid are helpful and mostly correct but fail when subgrids include bg internally without trimming.
 * contains_val is useful for skip logic but applied too late (after extraction).
 * The main program skeleton (bg detection, visited matrix, sort by key, horizontal concat) is a strong base but needs fixes for frame filling, skip conditions, and visited propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x37 grid (overly wide) dominated by 3's (likely bg) mixed with scattered 1's/6's/8's/7's/2's, forming messy untrimmed shapes like long 3-runs and partial objects (e.g., row0 has 21 3's then 8/3/9/etc.); this does not look correct as it appears to include vast bg areas as "objects" without proper trimming, includes probable invalid components (e.g., 9's suggesting unskipped frames, 4's absent but 7/2 may be noise), and lacks clean separated shapes—expected should be narrower (e.g., 5x15-25?) with distinct padded/trimmed objects like vertical bars (possibly 6/8), blobs (1/2/7), sorted by position, but here everything is jumbled with bg leaks, suggesting broken component detection (flood-fill grabs too much) and no effective skip for short/9-containing parts.
 * Specifically, test input seems to have bg=3, with objects like left 1/6-shapes, mid 8/7/2-clusters, right 8/3/6-frames—generated mangles this into unseparated mess (e.g., row2 has 1,6,1,8,6,1,3's,7,8's,2's,1,6,1,7,8,3's,1,7,1,1,7,1,6,8 vs. expected clean extracts), confirming over-extraction and poor sorting/trimming.
 * To handle test, must improve frame detection (e.g., better 9-matching and fill_color from actual interior, not default), stricter component size/filtering (e.g., skip if contains 9/4 even if h=5), and ensure visited prevents bg-inclusion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Basic and correct for determining background.

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                size = 0
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size += 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, size))
    return components
```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 00:49:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored or shaped cells, where the task is to detect, extract, and horizontally arrange connected components (objects) into a fixed 5-row output grid, treating "special frames" (bounded areas with vertical bars and 9-markers) differently by filling their interiors and adding gaps, while filtering out noise like small or invalid components. The arrangement sorts components top-to-bottom then left-to-right, padding shorter ones vertically and trimming excess background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same non-background value, detected via flood-fill (stack-based DFS); background (bg) is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, but must handle empty grids gracefully.
 * Filter out small components (size < 2), overly tall ones (height >5), or those too low in the grid (e.g., min_r > global_max_r -3, where global_max_r is the lowest row with non-bg); also skip if they contain 9 (unless in special frames) with height <5, or contain 4 at all, to avoid noise or invalid objects.
 * Special frames: Detect vertical 5-cell bars (same color, non-bg) starting from rows 0 to rows-5, then find bounding columns via paired 9's in top/bottom rows of the frame; extract 5xN subgrid, fill inner areas (rows 1-3, cols 1+) with a uniform "inside" color from [1][1], mark frame cells as visited to avoid re-processing.
 * Normal components: After special detection, flood-fill unvisited non-bg cells; extract subgrid, pad vertically to 5 rows with bg (centered), trim left/right bg columns; only include if post-trim subgrid is non-empty.
 * Sorting: By descending min_r (top-first), then ascending min_c (left-to-right) for same row.
 * Building output: Start with 5 empty rows; for each component, optionally add 2-column gap after special ones (middle row filled with inside color, others bg); then append the (padded/trimmed) 5-row subgrid horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Assume one frame per bar (break after finding); global_max_r ignores all-bg rows at bottom; special frames override normal detection via visited marking; gaps only after special (previous_is_special flag); inside fill only for special, and only replaces bg in inner area (not overwriting existing non-bg); handle out-of-bounds in extraction with bg padding; output is always 5 rows, even if no components (single bg cell).
 * Easy to miss: 9's act as frame boundaries but are skipped in normal components if height<5; 4's are outright invalid (perhaps representing holes or errors); vertical padding is centered (uneven split if needed); trimming only horizontal (left/right), not vertical (after padding); components can be wider than tall, but height limits apply; no diagonal connectivity (only 4 directions).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0

def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub

def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], orig_h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not sub:
        return []
    pad_top = (5 - orig_h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - orig_h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded

def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not sub:
        return []
    h = len(sub)
    w = len(sub[0])
    left = 0
    while left < w and all(sub[r][left] == bg for r in range(h)):
        left += 1
    right = w - 1
    while right > left and all(sub[r][right] == bg for r in range(h)):
        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left : right + 1] for row in sub]

def contains_value(sub: List[List[int]], val: int) -> bool:
    return any(val in row for row in sub)
```
* These are solid for subgrid extraction (handles OOB with bg), vertical centering pad to 5 rows, horizontal bg trim, and quick value checks (e.g., for 4 or 9 filtering).
* Component tuple type: Tuple[int, int, int, List[List[int]], bool, int] for (min_r, min_c, max_c, sub, is_special, inside_color) – useful for sorting and building.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
* The special frame detection loop assumes bars start at start_c and scans right for 9-pairs only in row 0 and 4 of frame; it's brittle if 9's are not exactly paired or if frames overlap/nest (breaks after one per bar, may miss multiples).
* The inside fill in special frames only replaces bg with inside_color in rows 1-3, cols 1+ of sub – but uses len(sub[rr]) which is post-extraction width, potentially overwriting frame edges if not careful; also hardcoded to inside_color = g[start_r +1][start_c +1], assuming uniform inside.
* Global_max_r computation skips all-bg rows but uses max with default -1; if entire grid is bg, it leads to empty output – but program handles with [[bg]] fallback, though filtering min_r > global_max_r -3 may exclude valid low components if global_max_r is low.
* Visited marking in special frames marks the entire subgrid row-wise, but only if nc in bounds – minor, but could leak if max_c_comp > cols.
* Normal component flood-fill updates min/max during stack pop (correct), but size count includes start; filter h = max_r - min_r +1 >5 skips tall, but after pad it's always 5, so filter before pad.
* Building result uses previous_is_special to add gap before next component, but no initial gap; if first is special, no leading gap (may be correct, but check if expected has leading space).
* No diagonal directions in flood-fill (good, 4-connectivity), but may merge diagonal objects incorrectly if puzzle assumes 8-connectivity (unknown).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core detection/sorting/padding/trimming works for simple cases without special frames or with basic components.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated a mostly flat/symmetric 5x20 grid with heavy 4's (bg?) and 8's as possible frames, plus small 1/2/3 inserts, but expected is asymmetric 5x22 with varied 1-8 numbers in distinct shapes (e.g., 6's in cols 12-14/20-22, 5's around 3's, 8's as frames?); generated ignored or misfiltered components (e.g., no 5/6, extra 4's everywhere), possibly over-trimming, wrong bg (4 instead of expected?), or failed special detection leading to no gaps/varied insides.
 * Sorting by (-min_r, min_c) worked for train1 but may have placed low components too early in train2, or special frames not detected (generated has 8's but not matching expected 8 positions).
 * Component filtering skipped too much in train2 (e.g., has_4 or has_9 rules eliminated valid objects with 4/9, or size/h filters too strict); generated has long 4-rows, suggesting untrimmed bg or all-components-as-bg fallback.
 * Special frame logic missed in train2: Expected has possible framed areas (e.g., 8's around 1/3/5/6), but generated filled with 4's/1's incorrectly; inside fill or 9-boundary detection broken for non-uniform insides.
 * Visited marking prevented double-counting in train1, but in train2 may have over-marked, skipping key components.
 * Gap addition only after special: Train2 generated no obvious gaps (continuous 4's/1's), suggesting no specials detected or flag not triggering.
 * Overall, attempt understood connected components and arrangement but broke on filtering/specials, leading to bg-flooded output; extract_subgrid/pad/trim are essential and worked, but flood-fill needs tighter bounds for min/max updates.
 * Unknown mismatch in train2 blob shapes: Generated 1/2/3 inserts are small/isolated vs expected connected 1-6 shapes; possibly wrong color grouping or post-trim distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a 5x37 grid with long horizontal stretches of 3's (rows 0/2/4 mostly 3's with 8 interruptions, row 1/3 mixed 1/3/6/7/8/2 but fragmented), suggesting over-extraction of a large 3-component or bg=3 with poor trimming, leading to concatenated bars/objects without proper separation or shape preservation (e.g., 8's as vertical frames but smeared horizontally, 7's/6's scattered like unfiltered noise).
 * Missing expected structure: No clear 5-row object arrangements with gaps; too many 3's imply wrong bg (if input bg isn't 3) or failed trim/pad, drowning small components (1/2/6/7 look like partial extracts but misaligned, e.g., 6's in row1 cols30-31/36-37 but isolated).
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: Lacks the clean, side-by-side object layout seen in train2 expected (varied shapes, no uniform filler rows); likely special frames not handled (8's/7's as bars? but no inside fill/gaps), or filtering let in invalid tall/wide 3-blobs; to fix, verify input bg, tighten has_9/has_4 skips, ensure one-frame-per-bar doesn't miss multiples, and check post-build widths match expected (37 cols seems arbitrary vs train2's 22).

[2025-10-01 00:49:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp

```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing a scene with a background color and various connected "objects" (blobs of non-background pixels), and the goal is to extract, process, and rearrange these objects into a standardized 5-row output grid by identifying valid components, normalizing their height and trimming, sorting them by horizontal position, and concatenating them side-by-side on a background, effectively creating a "gallery" or "sequence" of processed objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left pixel value; all processing treats non-bg connected pixels (4-directional adjacency) as part of objects.
 * Only include components that are short (height <=5) and have at least 2 pixels (size >=2); taller or single-pixel components are ignored to filter out irrelevant elements like bars or noise.
 * Extraction: Subgrids are pulled directly from the bounding box of each component, with out-of-bounds treated as bg.
 * Processing subtleties: Subgrids must be padded vertically to exactly 5 rows (centered if possible), and horizontally trimmed to remove leading/trailing all-bg columns (but keep at least the core if not empty); however, arbitrary filling (e.g., setting inner bg to 1 if 9 is present) alters pixel values incorrectly and should be avoided—pixels should remain as-is unless padding.
 * Sorting: Components are sorted primarily by leftmost column (min_c), secondarily by top row (min_r) to maintain left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order in the output.
 * Output construction: All processed subgrids are concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid, with bg filling any gaps; if no components, output a single bg cell; total width is the sum of trimmed subgrid widths.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components may overlap or be adjacent but are treated separately if not connected; bg can appear inside objects (holes), but the code doesn't fill them—potential need to detect/fill holes or preserve them; 9 might indicate special cases (e.g., "filled" or "target" objects), but forcing changes based on it breaks fidelity; ensure no vertical padding affects width; handle empty processed subgrids by skipping them.
 * Across attempts (this is the first): No rotation, scaling, or value remapping beyond padding/trimming; output must exactly match expected pixel values and dimensions, including bg placement; test cases may have asymmetric padding or irregular shapes that trimming must handle precisely.

```
(Simple tuple key for sorting components left-to-right then top-to-bottom; useful for output order.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg, finds connected components with proper filtering (height <=5, size >=2), extracts bounding subgrids without alteration, pads vertically to 5 rows (centered), trims horizontal bg columns, sorts by position, and concatenates into a 5-row output—basic structure works for arrangement.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated a 5x16 grid with misplaced values (e.g., 9s and 6s in wrong positions, extra columns from untrimmed or wrong components, inner rows have altered 1s/2s/3s/4s that don't match expected 5x12 with specific 6/1/4/2/3/8/9 placements); likely due to including extraneous components or poor trimming, resulting in wider output and value mismatches (e.g., expected starts with [6,8,9,...] but generated has [8,8,8,9,...]).
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x29 grid (too wide) with jumbled values (e.g., long stretches of 4s and misplaced 1/2/3/5/6/8), while expected is 5x22 with cleaner separation of components (e.g., expected has grouped 4s then 6s then objects); suggests over-inclusion of bg-adjacent pixels or failure to trim properly, plus possible asymmetric component extraction.
 * The process_subgrid function's contains_9 check and forced setting of inner bg to 1 is broken/unhelpful—it arbitrarily changes pixels (e.g., filling "holes" incorrectly), leading to value alterations not seen in expecteds; don't use this logic, as it introduces 1s where none should be and ignores true object shapes.
 * Overall, attempt shows good skeleton for component detection and layout but fails on fidelity (wrong widths, values) due to incorrect processing; no handling for holes or special values like 9 beyond bad filling; trimming works partially but not enough to match dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with values like clustered 1/3/4/6/8 and a 2/7 in row 3, but it does not look correct—width (16) mismatches training expecteds' patterns (e.g., train1=12, train2=22), and values seem disorganized (e.g., row 0 has 4s/6s/1s/3s/2s but no clear object separation; row 2 has a lone 7 which may be an artifact or unfiltered single-pixel); likely includes invalid components or poor trimming, as expecteds have tight, symmetric objects without outliers like 7.
 * Compared to training, it over-arranges (extra columns) and alters placements (e.g., 8s scattered vs. expected blocks); doesn't make sense as a "gallery" since shapes blend (e.g., row 4 has long 1/3/6 run without bg separation); to fix, ensure stricter component validation and no value changes to match expected clean outputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of distinct non-background "objects" or connected components from a 5-row input grid into a new horizontally concatenated 5-row output grid, with processing steps like vertical padding to 5 rows, horizontal trimming of background columns, and special handling for certain patterns (e.g., involving the number 9). The goal is to identify, filter, and position these components in a specific order (likely left-to-right by their original horizontal position) to form a composite image that matches expected patterns, possibly representing symbols, letters, or rebus elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (g[0][0]), and all components are defined as 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells; isolated single cells are ignored (size >=2 filter).
 * Only components with vertical height <=5 are considered; taller ones are skipped, ensuring everything fits the fixed 5-row output.
 * Vertical padding centers shorter components in a 5-row frame using bg, with uneven padding distributed (top gets floor((5-h)/2), bottom the rest).
 * Horizontal trimming removes leading/trailing columns that are entirely bg, but only after extraction; this can reduce width dynamically.
 * Special handling for height=5 components containing 9: If it has a left vertical bar of identical non-bg values, top/bottom-right 9s, and middle-right bg in rows 1-3, treat as "special" and augment it by adding a 3-column extension with 1s (filling bg areas in middle rows, plus two 1s in the row with a 4); otherwise, skip components with 9 entirely unless special.
 * Components are collected with their bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), then sorted by increasing min_r (top-first? but code uses -min_c for leftmost first, then min_r), and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid with total width summing component widths.
 * Subtle: Extraction must handle out-of-bounds columns gracefully by filling with bg; special case assumes fixed patterns like left bar and right 9s, but may miss variations (e.g., no 4 present or different positions).
 * Ordering is critical: Code sorts by (-min_c, min_r), prioritizing leftmost components first, then top among ties; this may reverse intended right-to-left or other orders.
 * Empty input or no valid components defaults to a single bg cell output.
 * Outputs are always exactly 5 rows; widths vary based on processed components.
 * Potential misses: Components might overlap or touch bg in complex ways; 9-handling seems over-specific and skips too many (e.g., non-special 9s are discarded); no rotation, scaling, or color changes beyond 1-fills in special case.
 * All numbers (1-9, bg like 8?) represent "pixels" of shapes; expected outputs show coherent symbols (e.g., framed 6s, 2-shapes, 3-bars in train1; multi-symbol rows in train2).

(Effective for removing pure bg columns horizontally; preserves shape without over-trimming.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows good structure for component detection and extraction (e.g., get_non_bg_components correctly finds bounding boxes and filters by size/height), but fails overall due to incorrect processing and arrangement.
 * Train1 generated a tiny 5x3 output with a simple 3-2-3 pattern framed in 8s, but expected a wider 5x12 with multiple distinct symbols (framed 6 with internal 1s/4/9, a 2-shape, and 3-bar); difference: too narrow (only one component?), missed special 9-handling or multiple objects, wrong sorting/concatenation leading to incomplete composite.
 * Train2 generated a bloated 5x29 with overlapping/jumbled numbers (e.g., long rows of 4s and 1s mixed with 3s/5s/6s in wrong positions), but expected a cleaner 5x22 with separated symbols (top/bottom 4-bars, internal 1-2-3-5-6 patterns); difference: excessive width from untrimmed or wrongly extended components, special 9-rule likely misapplied (no 9s visible, but output has artifacts), sorting placed components out of left-to-right order.
 * Special handling for 9-components (augmenting with 1s and skipping non-special) seems overly rigid and buggy: in train1, it probably skipped valid 9-parts or failed pattern match (e.g., no detection of left bar or 4-row), leading to omission; in train2, may have triggered wrongly, adding extra columns.
 * Sorting by (-min_c, min_r) prioritizes leftmost then top, which worked partially for horizontal order but failed to capture all components or right-order in train2 (e.g., 6s appear late but should be mid-right).
 * Default to [[bg]] on no components is safe but not triggered here; overall, extraction works (components found), but integration/concatenation doesn't (wrong widths, missing pieces).
 * No prior attempts, but this code's component logic is a strong base; avoid hardcoding special patterns without flexibility (e.g., exact row checks for 9s/4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with scattered numbers (3s/2s/4s/6s/1s/7s/8s in irregular patterns, e.g., row0 has 3-2-3-2-3 then 6s and 1s; row2 has a 4-1-4 cluster and 7), but it looks incoherent and jumbled, lacking the clean, separated symbol structures seen in expected train outputs (e.g., no framed shapes or aligned bars).
 * It does not appear correct: Width 16 suggests 3-4 components concatenated, but patterns overlap messily (e.g., 7 appears isolated in row2 col11, possibly an unfiltered single cell or extraction error); compared to train expects, it misses vertical alignment and padding (e.g., bottom row has full 3s but uneven 1-6-1), likely from faulty trimming or special handling introducing artifacts.
 * Probable issues: Special 9-rule (test input has no visible 9s, but code skips any with 9) not triggered, yet output has extras like 7 (maybe bg=3? input not shown, but assumes detection failed); sorting may have reversed order, placing left components rightward; overall, it doesn't form recognizable puzzle elements, indicating incomplete component capture or wrong concatenation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented as 2D lists of integers (likely colors or pixel values), where the task is to detect, extract, process (e.g., pad, trim), and rearrange specific structural elements like vertical bars with end markers (special frames) and connected components (simple shapes or blobs) into a new 5-row horizontal layout, sorted by position with gaps between disconnected elements. The background value (often 8 or similar) is used for padding and trimming, and the output must exactly match expected patterns without extras or omissions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection is key: Assume the top-left cell (g[0][0]) is the background (bg), used for padding empty areas and trimming borders; mismatches here could propagate errors.
 * Special frames: Look for vertical 5-cell-high bars of uniform non-bg color starting from row 0- (rows-5), with a horizontal connector marked by 9s at top and bottom rows; extract the subgrid from bar start to the rightmost 9 position, and pad to width 4 if shorter (but only add specific values like 1 in middle rows? code has bugs here).
 * Simple components: Use flood-fill to find connected regions (4-directional) of same color, non-bg; filter to height <=5 and size >=2; skip if they contain a '4' (perhaps indicating a hole or special marker) or if original height <5; pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centered; trim left/right bg columns only if entire column is bg.
 * Arrangement: Process special frames first (sorted left-to-right by start column), place them contiguously in output; then simple components below the max row of specials, sorted by (start_col, start_row); add 2 bg columns as gaps between groups if not adjacent (check if min_c == prev_max_c +1); entire output is 5 rows high, trimmed to used width.
 * Sorting and positioning: Components must respect original relative horizontal positions; specials seem to start from top rows, simples only if below specials' extent.
 * Subtleties: Padding for specials adds columns with specific non-bg values (e.g., 1 in rows 1-3) if width <4, but this seems buggy; avoid processing visited cells to prevent overlap; handle empty grids by returning [[bg]]; connected components must be same-color only; trim after padding can remove added bg but preserve content; '4' in a component likely flags it as invalid (e.g., contains a hole, skip it).
 * Edge cases: Grids with no elements return single bg cell; components spanning >5 rows are ignored; horizontal bars or non-vertical specials are not handled; test inputs may have isolated cells or minimal structures that collapse to single values.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with no trailing bg columns; if all bg, return [[bg]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects background correctly and uses flood-fill for components, which works for identifying simple blobs (e.g., the 1s, 2s, 3s in train 1).
 * Special frame detection partially works: It finds vertical bars and 9-endpoints, extracts subgrids, but fails to pad correctly (adds wrong values like 1s in bg areas, leading to extras in output).
 * Simple component extraction and padding/trimming works somewhat (pads to 5 rows, trims sides), but skips too many (e.g., those with '4' correctly, but placement ignores vertical position fully).
 * Arrangement logic is close but buggy: Sorts by column then row, adds 2-bg gaps for non-adjacent simples (good for separation), but places all specials first contiguously without gaps, and max_end filter skips too many simples (e.g., in train 1, some shapes like the 2-3 cluster are misplaced or split).
 * Train 1 generated output has correct frame at left (6-8-9-8 top/bottom), but extras like repeated 8s, misplaced 1s/4, and full 2-3 shapes jammed without proper gaps; expected has compact frame, then 1-blob with 4 inside (but skipped?), then 2-3 with gaps omitted—unknown why generated is longer/wider.
 * Train 2 generated just [4] (single row/cell?), but expected is full 5x22 grid with bars (4s), numbers (1-6), and shapes; attempt completely fails to detect/extract anything meaningful, likely because no 5-high bars or components below max_end, and trim/pad collapses everything.
 * find_special_frames is helpful but broken: Wrong padding logic (adds 1s instead of bg?), marks visited incorrectly, sorts by column but places without position awareness.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of extraction/padding but fails on integration, filtering (e.g., includes invalid components), and exact matching (e.g., no gaps in expected train 1 for adjacent shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is [3] (single row with one cell), which does not look correct; it resembles a collapsed or empty result, ignoring the complexity seen in training examples (e.g., train 2 expected has multi-row structures with numbers 1-8).
 * Likely misses all special frames and components, perhaps due to no 5-high bars, small size (<2), or all treated as bg; expected probably a simple processed shape or bar around the '3', but single cell suggests total failure in detection/extraction.
 * Does not match puzzle rules: Outputs should be 5 rows unless empty (then [[bg]]), and '3' alone ignores padding/arrangement; need to verify if test input has isolated '3' as a component (size=1, should skip) or part of larger structure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row grid where numbers represent colored pixels or segments forming "objects" or symbols (like digits or shapes). The goal is to extract connected components (blobs of the same number, excluding background), process them into standardized 5-high subgrids (padding vertically if needed, extending or modifying for special cases like presence of 9, trimming edges), group horizontally adjacent processed subgrids, prioritize or filter "special" components (those containing 9), and output a single horizontal concatenation of these groups with 2-unit background gaps between groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined as the top-left cell value (often 8 or 4 or 3); all processing ignores it.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-background color; only include if height <=5 and size >=2 (filters out small noise or single cells).
 * Omit components containing 4 but not 9 (likely a rule to ignore certain invalid or partial shapes).
 * For components shorter than 5 rows, pad vertically with background in the middle (symmetric top/bottom).
 * If a component contains 9 (special case, perhaps indicating a "key" or extensible shape like a digit with a stem), extend the subgrid width by 1 column and manually set positions [1:4] in the new column to 1 (this seems like adding a specific extension, e.g., a vertical line or hook, but it's hardcoded and may be incorrect).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from subgrids.
 * Group processed subgrids if they are horizontally adjacent (next min_c == current max_c +1), concatenating them into wider blocks without gaps inside groups.
 * Separate "special" (contains 9) from "normal" components; for specials, filter normals to only those starting at or above the lowest special's row (max_special_min_r, but code uses max of specials' min_r—wait, code says max_special_min_r = max(p[3] for p in special), which is the deepest starting row among specials, then normal = [p for p in normal if p[3] <= max_special_min_r], so keeping normals that start at or before that depth; this may be backwards or buggy).
 * Sort both special and normal groups by leftmost column (min_c) before grouping.
 * Final output: Concatenate all processed groups (specials first, then normals) horizontally with exactly 2 background cells as gaps between groups; output is always 5 rows high, width varies.
 * Subtle: Extraction assumes grid is rectangular; subgrids may need bounds checking. Presence of 9 triggers width extension but only if h==5? (code does it after padding, but only if has9). Trimming can empty a subgrid, leading to None (omit). Gaps are fixed at 2, but may need adjustment if groups touch or overlap. Components can overlap in rows (vertical stacking not handled, only horizontal grouping). Numbers like 1,2,3 may represent specific shape parts (e.g., 1=fill, 2=stroke), and 9/4 may be markers for validity/extension.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must update bounding box (min/max r/c) correctly during stack traversal (code does, but size increments inside loop). Padding is vertical only, no horizontal padding. Special filtering might intend to include only "above" specials but code uses <= on min_r, potentially including deeper normals incorrectly. Output starts with background-padded single row if no components.
 * All attempts must handle variable widths, ensure no internal gaps in groups, and preserve exact pixel values (no color changes except the hardcoded 1's for specials).

(Essential for extracting blob bounding boxes; works well for identifying objects.)

        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```
(These are core for subgrid handling; extraction and trimming are solid, padding works for vertical alignment.)

```python
def concat_subgrids(subs: List[List[List[int]]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Horizontally concatenates a list of 5-high subgrids into one wider grid; assumes all 5 rows.

    w_total = sum(len(s[0]) for s in subs)

    current = 0
    for s in subs:
        w = len(s[0])
        for r in range(h):
            for c in range(w):
                result[r][current + c] = s[r][c]
        current += w
    return result
```
(Helpful for building groups; but init to 0 is a bug—should use bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) detailed attempt shown, but it partially works: Component extraction via flood-fill correctly identifies blobs and bounds; vertical padding and trimming clean subgrids appropriately; grouping adjacent subgrids horizontally without internal gaps is a good approach.
 * What didn't work: In Train 1, generated output has incorrect left-side structure (full rows of 8's/bg with misplaced 3's and 2's forming a malformed shape, ending in a stray 6 column), vs expected which starts with 6's as left border/gap?, has a proper 1-4-9 shape (likely a processed special with extension), isolated 2's, and 3's on right—differences suggest wrong special handling (extension to 1's not matching expected 9/4 positions) and/or filtering omitted some normals or misordered groups; also, output width 14 vs expected 12, and trailing 6's don't match.
 * In Train 2, generated is overly wide (30 cols) with fragmented shapes (e.g., 1's and 2's not grouped properly, 8's scattered, 3's stretched), vs expected 22 cols with structured groups (e.g., 6's as borders, 1-3-4-5-8 shapes with 6 extensions, symmetric 1's); issues include no proper special processing (no 9's visible, but may be present), wrong grouping (e.g., 3's and 8's not concatenated correctly, gaps inside what should be groups), and possible over-inclusion of components; the 4's background is mishandled, leading to untrimmed junk.
 * Hardcoded extension for has9 (adding column of 1's in rows 1-3) seems unhelpful or broken—doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., Train 1 expected has 9 in top/bottom but no added 1's visible); likely wrong, as it forces a specific pattern that doesn't generalize.
 * Special/normal separation and filtering (keeping normals <= max special start row) may be inverted—Train 1 suggests normals below specials were wrongly included/excluded, causing vertical overlap or omission; sorting by min_c works but concatenation with fixed gap=2 adds extra space (Train 1 has too-wide output).
 * concat_subgrids initializes to 0 instead of bg, potentially corrupting empty areas (though overwritten, risky).
 * process_component omits has4 without has9 correctly (good), but has9 extension happens unconditionally after padding, even if h!=5 initially—may bloat widths incorrectly.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of blob extraction and horizontal layout but fails on special processing, filtering, and exact shape preservation; no vertical stacking or overlap resolution.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x20) does not look correct: It has full rows of 3's (likely bg) top/bottom, but middle rows show unprocessed or wrongly grouped elements—e.g., a 9-heavy left shape (rows 1-3 with 9's and 3's, possibly a malformed special), scattered 6's (maybe intended as borders or extensions but fragmented), 1's in a block, 8's and a 7 (7 is new, perhaps part of a shape), but no clear grouping or gaps; width 20 seems arbitrary/excessive, with no 2-unit bg gaps visible between potential groups (e.g., 6-1-8-3-6 run together).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats errors: Likely over-extracted components without proper trimming (e.g., 3's bleeding in), special 9 not extended correctly (9's are present but shape doesn't resemble expected digit-like output), and no filtering—e.g., the 7 might be a normal component included wrongly, and 8's/6's not grouped with adjacents; output feels like raw concatenation without processing, missing the structured horizontal layout with isolated shapes seen in expected trainings.
 * To handle test, need better special extension (not hardcoded 1's—perhaps copy or mirror), correct filtering (maybe exclude normals below specials), and verify adjacency grouping (test has potential adjacent 6-8-3 but not concatenated cleanly); without expected, it doesn't make sense as a puzzle solution—looks like noisy extraction rather than clean symbols.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 2D grid of integers representing colored pixels, where the goal is to identify and extract "objects" (connected components of the same non-background color), process them according to specific rules (e.g., removing certain elements like 4s, handling special frames marked by 9s, padding to a uniform height of 5 rows, and trimming background columns), and then reassemble them side-by-side in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order into a new 5-row grid that represents a cleaned or stylized version of the original scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left cell's value (g[0][0]), and all processing excludes it; objects are 4-connected same-color groups (up, down, left, right) with size >=2 and original height <=5.
 * Normal objects: Extract bounding box subgrid; if it contains a 9 and height <5, skip entirely; replace all 4s with bg and set their 4-adjacent cells (not diagonal) to bg; pad vertically to height 5 with bg (centered if possible); trim full-bg columns from sides; if height=5, additionally trim leading/trailing bg columns only if the middle row (row 2) has bg there (handles gaps in frames).
 * Special objects: Only for height=5 components containing 9; must have uniform non-bg color on left edge (all rows matching top-left), and 9s specifically at top-right and bottom-right; then crop to width 4 (min_c to min_c+3), fill internal bg cells (rows 1-3, cols 1-3) with the color at (min_r+1, min_c+1); apply standard trimming.
 * Skip normal objects if their top row (min_r) is within 3 rows of the global lowest non-bg row (global_max_r - 3), to avoid extracting partial or bottom "ground" elements.
 * Ordering: Collect all valid processed subgrids (special first, then normal), sort each group by (min_c, min_r) for left-to-right then top-to-bottom placement; concatenate horizontally into a single 5-row grid, filling with bg where needed; if no objects, return single bg cell.
 * Subtleties: Components must be same-color only (not mixed); extraction pads missing edges with bg but assumes grid is rectangular; special processing assumes a "frame" structure with right-side 9 markers and left uniform; 9-presence check is on the raw subgrid before modifications; trimming after padding/filling is crucial to remove extra space; global_max_r is the last row with any non-bg to detect "ground level"; size >=2 avoids single cells; in process_normal, 4-removal uses global positions for detection but modifies local subgrid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns [[bg]]; uneven widths in concatenation; potential overlap or adjacency not handled (assumes components are disjoint); if after trimming a subgrid is empty, discard it; vertical padding is not perfectly centered if height odd/even mismatch; trim_gap_columns only applies if exactly height 5 and checks middle row for bg gaps.
 * Potential misses: Not handling diagonal connections; assuming all objects are <=5 high (taller ones ignored implicitly); special fill uses a specific internal color, assuming it's the "body" color; no rotation or other transformations; output always exactly 5 rows, variable columns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Determines background color reliably from top-left.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    # ... (full implementation as in program)
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected same-color components, tracks bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) and size.
    # Filters to height <=5 and size >=2.
    return components
```
(Essential for identifying disjoint objects; visited matrix prevents re-processing; directions are only orthogonal.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Extracts rectangular bounding box, padding with bg if out-of-bounds (though assumes in-bounds typically).
    return sub
```
(Core for isolating objects; handles irregular grid edges if needed.)

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)

(Simple but key for detecting special cases; fast row-wise check.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], orig_h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Centers padding above/below to reach height 5; useful for uniform output height.
    return padded
```

```python
def trim_full_bg_columns(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Removes left/right columns that are entirely bg; prevents extra space.
    return trimmed
```

```python
def trim_gap_columns(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # For height=5 only: trims leading/trailing columns where middle row (index 2) is bg; targets internal gaps in frames.
    return trimmed
```
(These trimming functions are helpful for cleaning but may need refinement for non-frame gaps.)

```python
def process_normal(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int], bg: int, global_max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Handles standard object processing: 4-removal + adjacent bg-set, skip if near bottom or (9 and h<5), pad, trim.
    # Note: 4-detection uses global g, modification on local sub.
    return sub or []
```

```python
def process_special(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Strict checks for frame: left uniform non-bg, right-top/bottom 9s; crops to w=4, fills interior with specific color, trims.
    return sub or []
```
(These are central to the logic but have bugs in application, as seen in outputs.)

Unhelpful or broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `contains_four` is defined but unused (dead code, remove); the global_max_r calculation in `program` finds the max row with any non-bg, which is helpful but may miss multi-row ground if sparse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, building on implied prior code for component extraction.
 * Worked: Correctly identifies connected components by color and bounding box; basic extraction and padding to 5 rows; attempts to sort by position (min_c then min_r) for left-to-right/top-to-bottom ordering; handles bg exclusion and size/height filters; special case detection for 9s and partial implementation of frame filling.
 * Did not work: In training example 1, generated a symmetric 5x9 grid with 8s as bg?, misplaced 1/2/3 components without the left 6-frame (with 9s at [0,2] and [4,2]), wrong widths (e.g., no 4-column left frame, 3s blob too narrow), and 6s only on edges instead of integrated; expected has wider output with explicit 6-frame on left, then 1-blob with internal 4 (but 4 should be removed?), then separated 2/3 parts—suggests special processing failed to extract/position the 9-marked frame properly, and normal components concatenated without gaps or correct trimming.
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x24 grid with fragmented placements (e.g., 4s and 1s scattered, 3/5/6/8 mixed oddly, long bg runs), but expected is 5x22 with grouped 4-frames, internal 1/2/3/5/6/8 structures, and a right-side 1-blob with 4s—indicates wrong component grouping (e.g., treated adjacent different colors as separate but concatenated poorly), failed to skip/process bottom elements correctly (global_max_r skip not applied right), and trimming/padding left extra columns or merged unrelated parts; widths and positions mismatch (e.g., generated has extra 4s on top/bottom not in expected).
 * Overall: Component detection works for isolation but fails in processing (e.g., 4-removal not evident in outputs, special frames not cropped/filled correctly, leading to missing or malformed elements); sorting collects but concatenation ignores relative vertical spacing; no handling for overlapping bounds or multi-object per column; train outputs show over-trimming or under-extraction (e.g., unknown reason for 8s dominance in train1, possibly bg misdetect); helpful extraction functions like get_same_color_components are solid but process_normal/special need fixes for 9/4 logic and positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x37 grid (very wide) dominated by 3s (likely a large component not trimmed or split properly), with scattered 1/6/7/8/2 elements in narrow bands, but includes unprocessed 3-blobs on bottom/top and irregular placements (e.g., row 2 has long 1/6/7/8/3 runs without clear object separation, row 3 has isolated 6/8/2/7 amid 1/3). This suggests over-extraction of a massive 3-component (not filtered by height or near-bottom skip), poor trimming (full-bg columns not removed, gaps not handled), and failed special processing (possible 9s in input not triggering frames, leading to bloated width). Expected should be narrower, cleaner 5-row concatenation of distinct objects (e.g., left-to-right frames/blobs with removed 4s, padded internals, no ground 3s), likely around 20-30 columns with grouped colors like 1/6 on left, 2/7/8 in middle, trimmed 3s on right—but generated is messy and doesn't resemble a stylized scene, missing vertical alignment and having unknown extra 3-fills.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting distinct "objects" (connected components of the same non-background color) and special "frames" (vertical 5-high bars marked by 9's at the ends) from an input grid, processing them by padding short ones to 5 rows high, trimming background edges, sorting by their original leftmost column and top row position, and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid. The background color is determined from the top-left cell, and certain components (those containing 9 or 4 if shorter than 5 rows) are skipped to avoid noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color, excluding background; only include those with height <=5 and size >=2 to filter small noise.
 * Special frames are exactly 5 rows high vertical uniform-color bars (not background) with a matching 9 in the same column on both top and bottom rows to the right of the bar, defining the right boundary; the interior (rows 1-3, columns after the bar) should be filled with a detected color (or default 1 if none), and the frame may need horizontal padding to width 5 if short.
 * Skip any component shorter than 5 rows if it contains 9 (likely frame markers) or 4 (possibly a special forbidden element) to prevent including partial or invalid shapes.
 * Pad vertically centered with background for short components to reach exactly 5 rows; after padding/processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from each object to minimize width.
 * Sort all valid processed objects (regular + special frames) by a key of (leftmost_column, top_row) in the original grid, then place them left-to-right in the output, filling a 5xN grid where N is the total trimmed width; if no objects, output a single background cell.
 * Background is always the top-left cell's color (e.g., 8 in train1, 4 in train2, likely 3 in test); objects must not include background pixels except for padding/trimming.
 * Subtle: Special frames mark visited areas to avoid double-processing; regular components use flood-fill but respect visited marks from frames.
 * Easy to miss: Frames may have empty or single-color fills, default to 1 if no other color found; extraction must handle out-of-bounds with background; output must be exactly 5 rows, no vertical trimming.
 * Components spanning >5 rows are ignored (only <=5 height); horizontal spans can vary but are trimmed.
 * In examples, output rearranges objects in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom start positions), potentially reordering from input layout.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt identifies connected components via flood-fill and special 5-high frames marked by 9's, pads/trims them, and sorts/concatenates into 5 rows, which is a good structural match for the puzzle but fails on specifics.
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated a 5x13 grid starting with horizontal 8's and including misplaced 6's/9's/3's/2's/1's/4's; expected is 5x12 with vertical 6-bar on left, internal 1's/4, then 2-blob, then 3-shapes—generated mismatches by including extra 8's as objects, wrong ordering (e.g., 3-shapes before 6-bar), and no proper frame extraction for the 6/9 structure (unknown why 8's dominate left side).
 * In training example 2 (bg=4), generated a bloated 5x30 grid with repeated 4's/6's/1's/2's/3's/5's/8's in wrong positions and extra widths (e.g., long 4-runs not trimmed); expected is 5x22 with cleaner objects like 4-frames, 1/2-blobs, 3/5/6/8 shapes—generated includes untrimmed bg columns, processes too many overlapping/invalid components (e.g., skips 9/4 rule fails), and wrong sorting (e.g., 6's appear early but should be mid-right).
 * find_special_frames detects vertical bars and 9-markers but over-pads horizontally with fill_color (defaults to 1 incorrectly in empty cases), marks visited incorrectly (up to right_c inclusive, potentially overlapping), and assumes fixed width=5 post-padding which isn't in expected.
 * get_components works for bounding boxes but includes small/noisy components or those >5 high indirectly (via h<=5 check), and doesn't handle diagonal connections (correctly 4-connected).
 * Overall, attempt over-extracts (too wide outputs), misorders (keys not sorting left-to-right properly), and mishandles specials (e.g., no fill detection in train1 leads to bg-flooded frames).
 * extract_subgrid and pad_vertical/trim_subgrid are helpful and mostly correct but fail when subgrids include bg internally without trimming.
 * contains_val is useful for skip logic but applied too late (after extraction).
 * The main program skeleton (bg detection, visited matrix, sort by key, horizontal concat) is a strong base but needs fixes for frame filling, skip conditions, and visited propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x37 grid (overly wide) dominated by 3's (likely bg) mixed with scattered 1's/6's/8's/7's/2's, forming messy untrimmed shapes like long 3-runs and partial objects (e.g., row0 has 21 3's then 8/3/9/etc.); this does not look correct as it appears to include vast bg areas as "objects" without proper trimming, includes probable invalid components (e.g., 9's suggesting unskipped frames, 4's absent but 7/2 may be noise), and lacks clean separated shapes—expected should be narrower (e.g., 5x15-25?) with distinct padded/trimmed objects like vertical bars (possibly 6/8), blobs (1/2/7), sorted by position, but here everything is jumbled with bg leaks, suggesting broken component detection (flood-fill grabs too much) and no effective skip for short/9-containing parts.
 * Specifically, test input seems to have bg=3, with objects like left 1/6-shapes, mid 8/7/2-clusters, right 8/3/6-frames—generated mangles this into unseparated mess (e.g., row2 has 1,6,1,8,6,1,3's,7,8's,2's,1,6,1,7,8,3's,1,7,1,1,7,1,6,8 vs. expected clean extracts), confirming over-extraction and poor sorting/trimming.
 * To handle test, must improve frame detection (e.g., better 9-matching and fill_color from actual interior, not default), stricter component size/filtering (e.g., skip if contains 9/4 even if h=5), and ensure visited prevents bg-inclusion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
This correctly identifies the background color from top-left.

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored or shaped cells, where the task is to detect, extract, and horizontally arrange connected components (objects) into a fixed 5-row output grid, treating "special frames" (bounded areas with vertical bars and 9-markers) differently by filling their interiors and adding gaps, while filtering out noise like small or invalid components. The arrangement sorts components top-to-bottom then left-to-right, padding shorter ones vertically and trimming excess background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same non-background value, detected via flood-fill (stack-based DFS); background (bg) is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, but must handle empty grids gracefully.
 * Filter out small components (size < 2), overly tall ones (height >5), or those too low in the grid (e.g., min_r > global_max_r -3, where global_max_r is the lowest row with non-bg); also skip if they contain 9 (unless in special frames) with height <5, or contain 4 at all, to avoid noise or invalid objects.
 * Special frames: Detect vertical 5-cell bars (same color, non-bg) starting from rows 0 to rows-5, then find bounding columns via paired 9's in top/bottom rows of the frame; extract 5xN subgrid, fill inner areas (rows 1-3, cols 1+) with a uniform "inside" color from [1][1], mark frame cells as visited to avoid re-processing.
 * Normal components: After special detection, flood-fill unvisited non-bg cells; extract subgrid, pad vertically to 5 rows with bg (centered), trim left/right bg columns; only include if post-trim subgrid is non-empty.
 * Sorting: By descending min_r (top-first), then ascending min_c (left-to-right) for same row.
 * Building output: Start with 5 empty rows; for each component, optionally add 2-column gap after special ones (middle row filled with inside color, others bg); then append the (padded/trimmed) 5-row subgrid horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Assume one frame per bar (break after finding); global_max_r ignores all-bg rows at bottom; special frames override normal detection via visited marking; gaps only after special (previous_is_special flag); inside fill only for special, and only replaces bg in inner area (not overwriting existing non-bg); handle out-of-bounds in extraction with bg padding; output is always 5 rows, even if no components (single bg cell).
 * Easy to miss: 9's act as frame boundaries but are skipped in normal components if height<5; 4's are outright invalid (perhaps representing holes or errors); vertical padding is centered (uneven split if needed); trimming only horizontal (left/right), not vertical (after padding); components can be wider than tall, but height limits apply; no diagonal connectivity (only 4 directions).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0

def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub

def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], orig_h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not sub:
        return []
    pad_top = (5 - orig_h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - orig_h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded

def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not sub:
        return []
    h = len(sub)
    w = len(sub[0])
    left = 0
    while left < w and all(sub[r][left] == bg for r in range(h)):
        left += 1
    right = w - 1
    while right > left and all(sub[r][right] == bg for r in range(h)):
        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left : right + 1] for row in sub]

def contains_value(sub: List[List[int]], val: int) -> bool:
    return any(val in row for row in sub)
```
* These are solid for subgrid extraction (handles OOB with bg), vertical centering pad to 5 rows, horizontal bg trim, and quick value checks (e.g., for 4 or 9 filtering).
* Component tuple type: Tuple[int, int, int, List[List[int]], bool, int] for (min_r, min_c, max_c, sub, is_special, inside_color) – useful for sorting and building.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
* The special frame detection loop assumes bars start at start_c and scans right for 9-pairs only in row 0 and 4 of frame; it's brittle if 9's are not exactly paired or if frames overlap/nest (breaks after one per bar, may miss multiples).
* The inside fill in special frames only replaces bg with inside_color in rows 1-3, cols 1+ of sub – but uses len(sub[rr]) which is post-extraction width, potentially overwriting frame edges if not careful; also hardcoded to inside_color = g[start_r +1][start_c +1], assuming uniform inside.
* Global_max_r computation skips all-bg rows but uses max with default -1; if entire grid is bg, it leads to empty output – but program handles with [[bg]] fallback, though filtering min_r > global_max_r -3 may exclude valid low components if global_max_r is low.
* Visited marking in special frames marks the entire subgrid row-wise, but only if nc in bounds – minor, but could leak if max_c_comp > cols.
* Normal component flood-fill updates min/max during stack pop (correct), but size count includes start; filter h = max_r - min_r +1 >5 skips tall, but after pad it's always 5, so filter before pad.
* Building result uses previous_is_special to add gap before next component, but no initial gap; if first is special, no leading gap (may be correct, but check if expected has leading space).
* No diagonal directions in flood-fill (good, 4-connectivity), but may merge diagonal objects incorrectly if puzzle assumes 8-connectivity (unknown).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core detection/sorting/padding/trimming works for simple cases without special frames or with basic components.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated a mostly flat/symmetric 5x20 grid with heavy 4's (bg?) and 8's as possible frames, plus small 1/2/3 inserts, but expected is asymmetric 5x22 with varied 1-8 numbers in distinct shapes (e.g., 6's in cols 12-14/20-22, 5's around 3's, 8's as frames?); generated ignored or misfiltered components (e.g., no 5/6, extra 4's everywhere), possibly over-trimming, wrong bg (4 instead of expected?), or failed special detection leading to no gaps/varied insides.
 * Sorting by (-min_r, min_c) worked for train1 but may have placed low components too early in train2, or special frames not detected (generated has 8's but not matching expected 8 positions).
 * Component filtering skipped too much in train2 (e.g., has_4 or has_9 rules eliminated valid objects with 4/9, or size/h filters too strict); generated has long 4-rows, suggesting untrimmed bg or all-components-as-bg fallback.
 * Special frame logic missed in train2: Expected has possible framed areas (e.g., 8's around 1/3/5/6), but generated filled with 4's/1's incorrectly; inside fill or 9-boundary detection broken for non-uniform insides.
 * Visited marking prevented double-counting in train1, but in train2 may have over-marked, skipping key components.
 * Gap addition only after special: Train2 generated no obvious gaps (continuous 4's/1's), suggesting no specials detected or flag not triggering.
 * Overall, attempt understood connected components and arrangement but broke on filtering/specials, leading to bg-flooded output; extract_subgrid/pad/trim are essential and worked, but flood-fill needs tighter bounds for min/max updates.
 * Unknown mismatch in train2 blob shapes: Generated 1/2/3 inserts are small/isolated vs expected connected 1-6 shapes; possibly wrong color grouping or post-trim distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a 5x37 grid with long horizontal stretches of 3's (rows 0/2/4 mostly 3's with 8 interruptions, row 1/3 mixed 1/3/6/7/8/2 but fragmented), suggesting over-extraction of a large 3-component or bg=3 with poor trimming, leading to concatenated bars/objects without proper separation or shape preservation (e.g., 8's as vertical frames but smeared horizontally, 7's/6's scattered like unfiltered noise).
 * Missing expected structure: No clear 5-row object arrangements with gaps; too many 3's imply wrong bg (if input bg isn't 3) or failed trim/pad, drowning small components (1/2/6/7 look like partial extracts but misaligned, e.g., 6's in row1 cols30-31/36-37 but isolated).
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: Lacks the clean, side-by-side object layout seen in train2 expected (varied shapes, no uniform filler rows); likely special frames not handled (8's/7's as bars? but no inside fill/gaps), or filtering let in invalid tall/wide 3-blobs; to fix, verify input bg, tighten has_9/has_4 skips, ensure one-frame-per-bar doesn't miss multiples, and check post-build widths match expected (37 cols seems arbitrary vs train2's 22).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 00:58:51] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction, processing, and rearrangement of connected components (like blobs or frames) from an input grid into a standardized 5-row output grid, where components are sorted by their vertical position (prioritizing those lower in the grid) and horizontal position, with gaps added between them and special handling for "frames" defined by vertical bars and markers (9's). The goal is to reconstruct a clean, combined image of these components without backgrounds, ensuring shapes, positions, and fills match the expected layout while ignoring invalid or background elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from the top-left cell; all extractions must pad or trim relative to this to avoid including irrelevant space.
 * Special frames are vertical 5-high bars (non-bg, non-9) with 9 markers at top/bottom on the right side; these require extracting a subgrid, filling inner areas (rows 1-3) with the most common non-bg/non-9 color if needed, and extending width if under 4 columns.
 * Normal components are connected groups of same-color cells (4-directional connectivity), but only if height <=5, size >=2, no 4's inside, and for height<5 no 9's unless already 5-high; pad vertically to 5 rows if shorter, centering with bg.
 * Trim subgrids horizontally to remove leading/trailing bg columns, but only after padding; empty trimmed results are discarded.
 * Sort all components (special and normal) by descending max_row (lower in grid first), then ascending min_col (left to right); process in this order to build the output row-by-row.
 * Between components, if there's a gap (>0 columns apart), insert exactly 2 columns: bg everywhere except possibly middle row (r=2) filled with previous component's fill color if it was a special frame.
 * Global max_r is the lowest non-bg row to limit component search vertically; components below global_max_r -3 are ignored.
 * Subtleties: Special frames mark visited cells to avoid overlap; inner fill for specials uses mode of non-bg/non-9 cells in rows 1-3; normals skip if they contain 4 (possibly a forbidden color/marker) or invalid 9's; output starts empty 5 rows and extends horizontally only with components/gaps—no fixed width.
 * Easy to miss: Gaps only add 2 columns, not the full original gap; specials extend/fill to at least 4 wide internally; visited tracking prevents double-extraction; if no components, output single bg cell.
 * Considerations: Grids may have irregular heights/widths; components can't overlap in extraction but can be adjacent; output must exactly match expected shapes, including any extended fills or paddings.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extract background color from top-left cell."""

            else:

    if h == 0:
        return []
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```

```python
def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Trim leading/trailing bg columns from a subgrid horizontally."""
    if not sub:
        return []
    h = len(sub)
    w = len(sub[0])
    left = 0
    while left < w and all(sub[r][left] == bg for r in range(h)):
        left += 1
    right = w - 1
    while right > left and all(sub[r][right] == bg for r in range(h)):
        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```

```python
def contains_value(sub: List[List[int]], val: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a value exists anywhere in the subgrid."""
    return any(any(cell == val for cell in row) for row in sub)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies bg, extracts subgrids with padding/trimming, finds connected components via flood-fill with visited tracking, and sorts by bottom-to-top then left-to-right, which works for basic structure and gap detection.
 * It handles special frames by detecting vertical bars and 9-markers, filling inners with mode color, and extending width— this seems partially correct but over-applies filling in train1, leading to merged/incorrect shapes.
 * Normal components are found with 4-dir connectivity, skipping invalid ones (with 4's or misplaced 9's), and padded to 5 rows, but the size>=2 and height limits help avoid noise yet miss some valid short components in train2.
 * Sorting key (-max_r, min_c) prioritizes lower/left components correctly, and gap-adding logic (2 cols, optional middle fill) is a good attempt but fails in train1 by not inserting enough gaps or padding, resulting in only 10 cols vs expected 12.
 * In train1, generated output compresses the middle components (e.g., the 1-4-1 shape and 2-3 shapes are squished without proper 2-col gaps of 8's), and the right side lacks extension to match expected wider layout; unknown why the 2-3 blob isn't separated properly.
 * In train2, generated output creates a massive 24-col mess with all components jammed together without gaps or proper separation (e.g., 1-2-1 and 3's are concatenated directly, and bottom row is all 4's incorrectly), completely mismatching the expected 22-col structured layout with distinct sections (e.g., 6's on right, separated 1-3-4 groups); this suggests over-extraction or failure to trim/ignore large bg areas.
 * Function find_special_frames is helpful for bar detection and filling but buggy in width extension (appends bg then overwrites only inner rows, potentially leaving uneven edges).
 * Function find_normal_components is essential for blob extraction but too permissive on global_max_r limiting, causing train2 to include extraneous bottom elements; the stack-based flood-fill is correct but doesn't handle diagonal connections (good, as it's 4-dir).
 * Overall, the program builds a 5-row result incrementally, which works, but visited marking skips too much in specials, leading to missed normals; no unhelpful functions, but the gap-filling val logic (only middle row if prev special) is subtle and often applies bg wrongly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x43 grid that's excessively wide and chaotic, with long stretches of 3's (likely bg=3) dominating and components like 1-6-7-8 blobs jammed together without clear separation or trimming (e.g., rows 1-4 have overlapping 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's in a non-sensical merged way, and bottom row is all 3's except scattered).
 * It fails to properly extract and isolate components: for example, what should be distinct vertical frames or blobs (possibly with 8 as bars and 9's implied) are concatenated directly, creating runs like [8,1,1,1,3,3,...] that don't match any expected clean rearrangement.
 * Gaps are missing entirely (no 2-col bg separations), and vertical padding/trimming seems absent, leading to uneven heights implicitly merged; the presence of 7's and 6's scattered suggests partial special/normal detection but wrong sorting/placement (e.g., lower components not prioritized).
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as outputs should be compact 5-row composites of trimmed components with gaps, not a sprawling untrimmed dump—likely over-extracting or failing to discard invalid components below global_max_r.

[2025-10-01 00:58:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels (with a background color), where the goal is to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, extract and process them into standardized 5-row subgrids (padding vertically if needed, handling special cases like objects containing the value 9), omit invalid or small objects, sort the processed objects by their leftmost column and top row position, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores cells matching this color.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of the same non-background color; only include components where the height (max_r - min_r + 1) is <=5.
 * Omit components with fewer than 2 non-background cells (size <2).
 * Special omission: If a component contains the value 9 anywhere and its height <5, skip it entirely.
 * For components with height <5, extract the bounding subgrid and pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background color (even padding top/bottom).
 * For height=5 components containing 9, apply special modifications: In a specific case (min_r=11, min_c=20, likely "train1 lower"), resize width to 4, re-extract the subgrid, and manually set certain inner cells (rows 1-3, column 3) to 1 (possibly filling a "hole" or correcting a shape).
 * Sorting: Processed components are sorted by (min_c, min_r), i.e., primarily by leftmost column, secondarily by top row.
 * Concatenation: Place sorted subgrids side-by-side in a new 5-row grid, filling with background where needed; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Grids are rectangular (all rows same length); extraction must handle potential out-of-bounds columns by padding with background, though in practice bounding boxes should stay within grid.
 * Subtle: Components may not be rectangular—extraction takes the bounding box, which may include background cells inside; size count only counts non-background cells for omission checks.
 * Potential for non-square objects; widths vary, and concatenation must align rows properly.
 * Hardcoded special case suggests puzzle has specific "train1" or example-specific anomalies (e.g., malformed shapes needing manual correction).
 * Easy to miss: Visited matrix prevents revisiting; stack-based flood fill for component discovery; ensure no diagonal connections.

The following functions from the attempt are mostly helpful for component detection and extraction but contain bugs (e.g., potential index errors or type mismatches leading to the observed error); they capture core logic like flood fill and bounding box computation, which align with puzzle needs—refine rather than discard.

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Simple, correct way to detect background.)

```python
def get_same_color_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                current_color = g[i][j]
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == current_color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(Helpful: Correct flood-fill for same-color connected components with bounding boxes; filters height <=5; uses stack for DFS—essential for object detection. Minor: Could add width filter if needed, but not in rules.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(Helpful: Extracts bounding subgrid, padding out-of-bounds with bg; handles irregular grids. Subtle bug risk: Assumes min_c/max_c valid, but condition prevents crashes.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
(Helpful: Centers vertical padding to 5 rows; assumes uniform width—core for standardization.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Helpful: Defines sorting tuple for left-to-top priority.)

No unhelpful or broken functions stand out—all contribute to the pipeline, though the main program has integration bugs (see below). No custom types defined, but Tuple[int,int,int,int] for bounding boxes is implicitly useful.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, filtering (size<2, 9-with-low-height omission), special 9-handling, padding, sorting, and concatenation, showing good understanding of object-based processing and puzzle subtleties like hardcoded fixes.
 * What worked: Component discovery via flood fill correctly identifies connected same-color blobs with bounding boxes; omission rules (size, 9) and vertical padding logic are sound and match inferred rules; special case for "train1 lower" (resizing and filling cells) addresses a likely shape anomaly.
 * What didn't work: The program crashes with "object of type 'int' has no len()" on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test), preventing any output generation—likely due to a type error in concatenation where len() is called on an int (possible causes: mismatched row lengths making padded[r] an int somehow, or error propagating from special case sub modification; e.g., sub[r][3]=1 might index out-of-bounds if w!=4, or extract_subgrid returns non-list). No observed outputs to compare, so cannot verify if processed grids match expectations (e.g., does it correctly omit small blobs or pad shapes? Unknown due to crash).
 * Integration bug in main program: current_col += len(padded[r]) assumes padded[r] is always a list, but if a row becomes an int (e.g., via faulty extraction or padding), it fails; also, w_total calculation uses len(p[1][0]), assuming non-empty, but if processed is empty, it sets w_total=0 correctly—yet crash happens regardless.
 * Sorting and concatenation logic is correct in theory but untested due to error; special case is puzzle-specific and may overfit to "train1" without generalizing.
 * extract_subgrid and get_same_color_components are essential and mostly correct—keep and debug them; pad_vertical is solid but assumes fixed w.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt misses robust error-handling (e.g., validate row lengths post-extraction) and input validation (e.g., ensure g is list of lists of ints).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an execution error ("object of type 'int' has no len()"), which does not make sense or look correct—it produces no grid at all, just a crash, meaning the program fails to process the test input entirely.
 * Without a valid output grid, cannot verify if it matches expected puzzle solution (e.g., correctly extracted/padded/sorted objects concatenated into 5 rows); the error indicates a fundamental bug preventing any meaningful result, differing from expectation of a valid 5-row grid (likely with specific shapes like numbers or symbols reformed from components).
 * This crash on test (and trainings) suggests the special handling or extraction doesn't generalize, possibly mishandling test-specific components (e.g., irregular widths or 9 placements); to fix, need to debug len() calls and ensure all subgrids have uniform list-of-list structure—test output should resemble a horizontally assembled "image" of processed objects, but here it's absent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing a scene with a background color and various connected "objects" (blobs of non-background pixels), and the goal is to extract, process, and rearrange these objects into a standardized 5-row output grid by identifying valid components, normalizing their height and trimming, sorting them by horizontal position, and concatenating them side-by-side on a background, effectively creating a "gallery" or "sequence" of processed objects.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left pixel value; all processing treats non-bg connected pixels (4-directional adjacency) as part of objects.
 * Only include components that are short (height <=5) and have at least 2 pixels (size >=2); taller or single-pixel components are ignored to filter out irrelevant elements like bars or noise.
 * Extraction: Subgrids are pulled directly from the bounding box of each component, with out-of-bounds treated as bg.
 * Processing subtleties: Subgrids must be padded vertically to exactly 5 rows (centered if possible), and horizontally trimmed to remove leading/trailing all-bg columns (but keep at least the core if not empty); however, arbitrary filling (e.g., setting inner bg to 1 if 9 is present) alters pixel values incorrectly and should be avoided—pixels should remain as-is unless padding.
 * Sorting: Components are sorted primarily by leftmost column (min_c), secondarily by top row (min_r) to maintain left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order in the output.
 * Output construction: All processed subgrids are concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid, with bg filling any gaps; if no components, output a single bg cell; total width is the sum of trimmed subgrid widths.
 * Easy-to-miss: Components may overlap or be adjacent but are treated separately if not connected; bg can appear inside objects (holes), but the code doesn't fill them—potential need to detect/fill holes or preserve them; 9 might indicate special cases (e.g., "filled" or "target" objects), but forcing changes based on it breaks fidelity; ensure no vertical padding affects width; handle empty processed subgrids by skipping them.
 * Across attempts (this is the first): No rotation, scaling, or value remapping beyond padding/trimming; output must exactly match expected pixel values and dimensions, including bg placement; test cases may have asymmetric padding or irregular shapes that trimming must handle precisely.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies background from top-left, assuming consistent bg.)

def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:

                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size = 1
                while stack:

                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1

                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder with bounding box and filtering is solid and essential for identifying objects; uses stack for efficiency.)

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = [g[r][c] if 0 <= c < len(g[0]) else bg for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
(This bounding box extraction is helpful and preserves original values, handling edges correctly.)

```python
def sort_key(comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = comp
    return (min_c, min_r)
```
(Simple tuple key for sorting components left-to-right then top-to-bottom; useful for output order.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg, finds connected components with proper filtering (height <=5, size >=2), extracts bounding subgrids without alteration, pads vertically to 5 rows (centered), trims horizontal bg columns, sorts by position, and concatenates into a 5-row output—basic structure works for arrangement.
 * What didn't work: In training example 1, generated a 5x16 grid with misplaced values (e.g., 9s and 6s in wrong positions, extra columns from untrimmed or wrong components, inner rows have altered 1s/2s/3s/4s that don't match expected 5x12 with specific 6/1/4/2/3/8/9 placements); likely due to including extraneous components or poor trimming, resulting in wider output and value mismatches (e.g., expected starts with [6,8,9,...] but generated has [8,8,8,9,...]).
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x29 grid (too wide) with jumbled values (e.g., long stretches of 4s and misplaced 1/2/3/5/6/8), while expected is 5x22 with cleaner separation of components (e.g., expected has grouped 4s then 6s then objects); suggests over-inclusion of bg-adjacent pixels or failure to trim properly, plus possible asymmetric component extraction.
 * The process_subgrid function's contains_9 check and forced setting of inner bg to 1 is broken/unhelpful—it arbitrarily changes pixels (e.g., filling "holes" incorrectly), leading to value alterations not seen in expecteds; don't use this logic, as it introduces 1s where none should be and ignores true object shapes.
 * Overall, attempt shows good skeleton for component detection and layout but fails on fidelity (wrong widths, values) due to incorrect processing; no handling for holes or special values like 9 beyond bad filling; trimming works partially but not enough to match dimensions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with values like clustered 1/3/4/6/8 and a 2/7 in row 3, but it does not look correct—width (16) mismatches training expecteds' patterns (e.g., train1=12, train2=22), and values seem disorganized (e.g., row 0 has 4s/6s/1s/3s/2s but no clear object separation; row 2 has a lone 7 which may be an artifact or unfiltered single-pixel); likely includes invalid components or poor trimming, as expecteds have tight, symmetric objects without outliers like 7.
 * Compared to training, it over-arranges (extra columns) and alters placements (e.g., 8s scattered vs. expected blocks); doesn't make sense as a "gallery" since shapes blend (e.g., row 4 has long 1/3/6 run without bg separation); to fix, ensure stricter component validation and no value changes to match expected clean outputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the extraction and rearrangement of distinct non-background "objects" or connected components from a 5-row input grid into a new horizontally concatenated 5-row output grid, with processing steps like vertical padding to 5 rows, horizontal trimming of background columns, and special handling for certain patterns (e.g., involving the number 9). The goal is to identify, filter, and position these components in a specific order (likely left-to-right by their original horizontal position) to form a composite image that matches expected patterns, possibly representing symbols, letters, or rebus elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (g[0][0]), and all components are defined as 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells; isolated single cells are ignored (size >=2 filter).
 * Only components with vertical height <=5 are considered; taller ones are skipped, ensuring everything fits the fixed 5-row output.
 * Vertical padding centers shorter components in a 5-row frame using bg, with uneven padding distributed (top gets floor((5-h)/2), bottom the rest).
 * Horizontal trimming removes leading/trailing columns that are entirely bg, but only after extraction; this can reduce width dynamically.
 * Special handling for height=5 components containing 9: If it has a left vertical bar of identical non-bg values, top/bottom-right 9s, and middle-right bg in rows 1-3, treat as "special" and augment it by adding a 3-column extension with 1s (filling bg areas in middle rows, plus two 1s in the row with a 4); otherwise, skip components with 9 entirely unless special.
 * Components are collected with their bounding boxes (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), then sorted by increasing min_r (top-first? but code uses -min_c for leftmost first, then min_r), and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid with total width summing component widths.
 * Subtle: Extraction must handle out-of-bounds columns gracefully by filling with bg; special case assumes fixed patterns like left bar and right 9s, but may miss variations (e.g., no 4 present or different positions).
 * Ordering is critical: Code sorts by (-min_c, min_r), prioritizing leftmost components first, then top among ties; this may reverse intended right-to-left or other orders.
 * Empty input or no valid components defaults to a single bg cell output.
 * Outputs are always exactly 5 rows; widths vary based on processed components.
 * Potential misses: Components might overlap or touch bg in complex ways; 9-handling seems over-specific and skips too many (e.g., non-special 9s are discarded); no rotation, scaling, or color changes beyond 1-fills in special case.
 * All numbers (1-9, bg like 8?) represent "pixels" of shapes; expected outputs show coherent symbols (e.g., framed 6s, 2-shapes, 3-bars in train1; multi-symbol rows in train2).

(This DFS-based component finder with bounding boxes is essential and works well for isolating objects; filters appropriately for size and height.)

(Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids, handling edge cases with bg fill; accurate.)

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:

    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]

(Useful for centering short components vertically in 5 rows; correct distribution of padding.)

```python
def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(sub)
    if h == 0:
        return []

        left += 1
    right = w - 1

        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left:right + 1] for row in sub]
```
(Effective for removing pure bg columns horizontally; preserves shape without over-trimming.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows good structure for component detection and extraction (e.g., get_non_bg_components correctly finds bounding boxes and filters by size/height), but fails overall due to incorrect processing and arrangement.
 * Train1 generated a tiny 5x3 output with a simple 3-2-3 pattern framed in 8s, but expected a wider 5x12 with multiple distinct symbols (framed 6 with internal 1s/4/9, a 2-shape, and 3-bar); difference: too narrow (only one component?), missed special 9-handling or multiple objects, wrong sorting/concatenation leading to incomplete composite.
 * Train2 generated a bloated 5x29 with overlapping/jumbled numbers (e.g., long rows of 4s and 1s mixed with 3s/5s/6s in wrong positions), but expected a cleaner 5x22 with separated symbols (top/bottom 4-bars, internal 1-2-3-5-6 patterns); difference: excessive width from untrimmed or wrongly extended components, special 9-rule likely misapplied (no 9s visible, but output has artifacts), sorting placed components out of left-to-right order.
 * Special handling for 9-components (augmenting with 1s and skipping non-special) seems overly rigid and buggy: in train1, it probably skipped valid 9-parts or failed pattern match (e.g., no detection of left bar or 4-row), leading to omission; in train2, may have triggered wrongly, adding extra columns.
 * Sorting by (-min_c, min_r) prioritizes leftmost then top, which worked partially for horizontal order but failed to capture all components or right-order in train2 (e.g., 6s appear late but should be mid-right).
 * Default to [[bg]] on no components is safe but not triggered here; overall, extraction works (components found), but integration/concatenation doesn't (wrong widths, missing pieces).
 * No prior attempts, but this code's component logic is a strong base; avoid hardcoding special patterns without flexibility (e.g., exact row checks for 9s/4s).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x16 grid with scattered numbers (3s/2s/4s/6s/1s/7s/8s in irregular patterns, e.g., row0 has 3-2-3-2-3 then 6s and 1s; row2 has a 4-1-4 cluster and 7), but it looks incoherent and jumbled, lacking the clean, separated symbol structures seen in expected train outputs (e.g., no framed shapes or aligned bars).
 * It does not appear correct: Width 16 suggests 3-4 components concatenated, but patterns overlap messily (e.g., 7 appears isolated in row2 col11, possibly an unfiltered single cell or extraction error); compared to train expects, it misses vertical alignment and padding (e.g., bottom row has full 3s but uneven 1-6-1), likely from faulty trimming or special handling introducing artifacts.
 * Probable issues: Special 9-rule (test input has no visible 9s, but code skips any with 9) not triggered, yet output has extras like 7 (maybe bg=3? input not shown, but assumes detection failed); sorting may have reversed order, placing left components rightward; overall, it doesn't form recognizable puzzle elements, indicating incomplete component capture or wrong concatenation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented as 2D lists of integers (likely colors or pixel values), where the task is to detect, extract, process (e.g., pad, trim), and rearrange specific structural elements like vertical bars with end markers (special frames) and connected components (simple shapes or blobs) into a new 5-row horizontal layout, sorted by position with gaps between disconnected elements. The background value (often 8 or similar) is used for padding and trimming, and the output must exactly match expected patterns without extras or omissions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background detection is key: Assume the top-left cell (g[0][0]) is the background (bg), used for padding empty areas and trimming borders; mismatches here could propagate errors.
 * Special frames: Look for vertical 5-cell-high bars of uniform non-bg color starting from row 0- (rows-5), with a horizontal connector marked by 9s at top and bottom rows; extract the subgrid from bar start to the rightmost 9 position, and pad to width 4 if shorter (but only add specific values like 1 in middle rows? code has bugs here).
 * Simple components: Use flood-fill to find connected regions (4-directional) of same color, non-bg; filter to height <=5 and size >=2; skip if they contain a '4' (perhaps indicating a hole or special marker) or if original height <5; pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centered; trim left/right bg columns only if entire column is bg.
 * Arrangement: Process special frames first (sorted left-to-right by start column), place them contiguously in output; then simple components below the max row of specials, sorted by (start_col, start_row); add 2 bg columns as gaps between groups if not adjacent (check if min_c == prev_max_c +1); entire output is 5 rows high, trimmed to used width.
 * Sorting and positioning: Components must respect original relative horizontal positions; specials seem to start from top rows, simples only if below specials' extent.
 * Subtleties: Padding for specials adds columns with specific non-bg values (e.g., 1 in rows 1-3) if width <4, but this seems buggy; avoid processing visited cells to prevent overlap; handle empty grids by returning [[bg]]; connected components must be same-color only; trim after padding can remove added bg but preserve content; '4' in a component likely flags it as invalid (e.g., contains a hole, skip it).
 * Edge cases: Grids with no elements return single bg cell; components spanning >5 rows are ignored; horizontal bars or non-vertical specials are not handled; test inputs may have isolated cells or minimal structures that collapse to single values.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with no trailing bg columns; if all bg, return [[bg]].

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects background correctly and uses flood-fill for components, which works for identifying simple blobs (e.g., the 1s, 2s, 3s in train 1).
 * Special frame detection partially works: It finds vertical bars and 9-endpoints, extracts subgrids, but fails to pad correctly (adds wrong values like 1s in bg areas, leading to extras in output).
 * Simple component extraction and padding/trimming works somewhat (pads to 5 rows, trims sides), but skips too many (e.g., those with '4' correctly, but placement ignores vertical position fully).
 * Arrangement logic is close but buggy: Sorts by column then row, adds 2-bg gaps for non-adjacent simples (good for separation), but places all specials first contiguously without gaps, and max_end filter skips too many simples (e.g., in train 1, some shapes like the 2-3 cluster are misplaced or split).
 * Train 1 generated output has correct frame at left (6-8-9-8 top/bottom), but extras like repeated 8s, misplaced 1s/4, and full 2-3 shapes jammed without proper gaps; expected has compact frame, then 1-blob with 4 inside (but skipped?), then 2-3 with gaps omitted—unknown why generated is longer/wider.
 * Train 2 generated just [4] (single row/cell?), but expected is full 5x22 grid with bars (4s), numbers (1-6), and shapes; attempt completely fails to detect/extract anything meaningful, likely because no 5-high bars or components below max_end, and trim/pad collapses everything.
 * find_special_frames is helpful but broken: Wrong padding logic (adds 1s instead of bg?), marks visited incorrectly, sorts by column but places without position awareness.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of extraction/padding but fails on integration, filtering (e.g., includes invalid components), and exact matching (e.g., no gaps in expected train 1 for adjacent shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is [3] (single row with one cell), which does not look correct; it resembles a collapsed or empty result, ignoring the complexity seen in training examples (e.g., train 2 expected has multi-row structures with numbers 1-8).
 * Likely misses all special frames and components, perhaps due to no 5-high bars, small size (<2), or all treated as bg; expected probably a simple processed shape or bar around the '3', but single cell suggests total failure in detection/extraction.
 * Does not match puzzle rules: Outputs should be 5 rows unless empty (then [[bg]]), and '3' alone ignores padding/arrangement; need to verify if test input has isolated '3' as a component (size=1, should skip) or part of larger structure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row grid where numbers represent colored pixels or segments forming "objects" or symbols (like digits or shapes). The goal is to extract connected components (blobs of the same number, excluding background), process them into standardized 5-high subgrids (padding vertically if needed, extending or modifying for special cases like presence of 9, trimming edges), group horizontally adjacent processed subgrids, prioritize or filter "special" components (those containing 9), and output a single horizontal concatenation of these groups with 2-unit background gaps between groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined as the top-left cell value (often 8 or 4 or 3); all processing ignores it.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same non-background color; only include if height <=5 and size >=2 (filters out small noise or single cells).
 * Omit components containing 4 but not 9 (likely a rule to ignore certain invalid or partial shapes).
 * For components shorter than 5 rows, pad vertically with background in the middle (symmetric top/bottom).
 * If a component contains 9 (special case, perhaps indicating a "key" or extensible shape like a digit with a stem), extend the subgrid width by 1 column and manually set positions [1:4] in the new column to 1 (this seems like adding a specific extension, e.g., a vertical line or hook, but it's hardcoded and may be incorrect).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from subgrids.
 * Group processed subgrids if they are horizontally adjacent (next min_c == current max_c +1), concatenating them into wider blocks without gaps inside groups.
 * Separate "special" (contains 9) from "normal" components; for specials, filter normals to only those starting at or above the lowest special's row (max_special_min_r, but code uses max of specials' min_r—wait, code says max_special_min_r = max(p[3] for p in special), which is the deepest starting row among specials, then normal = [p for p in normal if p[3] <= max_special_min_r], so keeping normals that start at or before that depth; this may be backwards or buggy).
 * Sort both special and normal groups by leftmost column (min_c) before grouping.
 * Final output: Concatenate all processed groups (specials first, then normals) horizontally with exactly 2 background cells as gaps between groups; output is always 5 rows high, width varies.
 * Subtle: Extraction assumes grid is rectangular; subgrids may need bounds checking. Presence of 9 triggers width extension but only if h==5? (code does it after padding, but only if has9). Trimming can empty a subgrid, leading to None (omit). Gaps are fixed at 2, but may need adjustment if groups touch or overlap. Components can overlap in rows (vertical stacking not handled, only horizontal grouping). Numbers like 1,2,3 may represent specific shape parts (e.g., 1=fill, 2=stroke), and 9/4 may be markers for validity/extension.
 * Easy to miss: Flood-fill must update bounding box (min/max r/c) correctly during stack traversal (code does, but size increments inside loop). Padding is vertical only, no horizontal padding. Special filtering might intend to include only "above" specials but code uses <= on min_r, potentially including deeper normals incorrectly. Output starts with background-padded single row if no components.
 * All attempts must handle variable widths, ensure no internal gaps in groups, and preserve exact pixel values (no color changes except the hardcoded 1's for specials).

        current += w

```
(Helpful for building groups; but init to 0 is a bug—should use bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) detailed attempt shown, but it partially works: Component extraction via flood-fill correctly identifies blobs and bounds; vertical padding and trimming clean subgrids appropriately; grouping adjacent subgrids horizontally without internal gaps is a good approach.
 * What didn't work: In Train 1, generated output has incorrect left-side structure (full rows of 8's/bg with misplaced 3's and 2's forming a malformed shape, ending in a stray 6 column), vs expected which starts with 6's as left border/gap?, has a proper 1-4-9 shape (likely a processed special with extension), isolated 2's, and 3's on right—differences suggest wrong special handling (extension to 1's not matching expected 9/4 positions) and/or filtering omitted some normals or misordered groups; also, output width 14 vs expected 12, and trailing 6's don't match.
 * In Train 2, generated is overly wide (30 cols) with fragmented shapes (e.g., 1's and 2's not grouped properly, 8's scattered, 3's stretched), vs expected 22 cols with structured groups (e.g., 6's as borders, 1-3-4-5-8 shapes with 6 extensions, symmetric 1's); issues include no proper special processing (no 9's visible, but may be present), wrong grouping (e.g., 3's and 8's not concatenated correctly, gaps inside what should be groups), and possible over-inclusion of components; the 4's background is mishandled, leading to untrimmed junk.
 * Hardcoded extension for has9 (adding column of 1's in rows 1-3) seems unhelpful or broken—doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., Train 1 expected has 9 in top/bottom but no added 1's visible); likely wrong, as it forces a specific pattern that doesn't generalize.
 * Special/normal separation and filtering (keeping normals <= max special start row) may be inverted—Train 1 suggests normals below specials were wrongly included/excluded, causing vertical overlap or omission; sorting by min_c works but concatenation with fixed gap=2 adds extra space (Train 1 has too-wide output).
 * concat_subgrids initializes to 0 instead of bg, potentially corrupting empty areas (though overwritten, risky).
 * process_component omits has4 without has9 correctly (good), but has9 extension happens unconditionally after padding, even if h!=5 initially—may bloat widths incorrectly.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of blob extraction and horizontal layout but fails on special processing, filtering, and exact shape preservation; no vertical stacking or overlap resolution.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x20) does not look correct: It has full rows of 3's (likely bg) top/bottom, but middle rows show unprocessed or wrongly grouped elements—e.g., a 9-heavy left shape (rows 1-3 with 9's and 3's, possibly a malformed special), scattered 6's (maybe intended as borders or extensions but fragmented), 1's in a block, 8's and a 7 (7 is new, perhaps part of a shape), but no clear grouping or gaps; width 20 seems arbitrary/excessive, with no 2-unit bg gaps visible between potential groups (e.g., 6-1-8-3-6 run together).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats errors: Likely over-extracted components without proper trimming (e.g., 3's bleeding in), special 9 not extended correctly (9's are present but shape doesn't resemble expected digit-like output), and no filtering—e.g., the 7 might be a normal component included wrongly, and 8's/6's not grouped with adjacents; output feels like raw concatenation without processing, missing the structured horizontal layout with isolated shapes seen in expected trainings.
 * To handle test, need better special extension (not hardcoded 1's—perhaps copy or mirror), correct filtering (maybe exclude normals below specials), and verify adjacency grouping (test has potential adjacent 6-8-3 but not concatenated cleanly); without expected, it doesn't make sense as a puzzle solution—looks like noisy extraction rather than clean symbols.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 2D grid of integers representing colored pixels, where the goal is to identify and extract "objects" (connected components of the same non-background color), process them according to specific rules (e.g., removing certain elements like 4s, handling special frames marked by 9s, padding to a uniform height of 5 rows, and trimming background columns), and then reassemble them side-by-side in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order into a new 5-row grid that represents a cleaned or stylized version of the original scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the top-left cell's value (g[0][0]), and all processing excludes it; objects are 4-connected same-color groups (up, down, left, right) with size >=2 and original height <=5.
 * Normal objects: Extract bounding box subgrid; if it contains a 9 and height <5, skip entirely; replace all 4s with bg and set their 4-adjacent cells (not diagonal) to bg; pad vertically to height 5 with bg (centered if possible); trim full-bg columns from sides; if height=5, additionally trim leading/trailing bg columns only if the middle row (row 2) has bg there (handles gaps in frames).
 * Special objects: Only for height=5 components containing 9; must have uniform non-bg color on left edge (all rows matching top-left), and 9s specifically at top-right and bottom-right; then crop to width 4 (min_c to min_c+3), fill internal bg cells (rows 1-3, cols 1-3) with the color at (min_r+1, min_c+1); apply standard trimming.
 * Skip normal objects if their top row (min_r) is within 3 rows of the global lowest non-bg row (global_max_r - 3), to avoid extracting partial or bottom "ground" elements.
 * Ordering: Collect all valid processed subgrids (special first, then normal), sort each group by (min_c, min_r) for left-to-right then top-to-bottom placement; concatenate horizontally into a single 5-row grid, filling with bg where needed; if no objects, return single bg cell.
 * Subtleties: Components must be same-color only (not mixed); extraction pads missing edges with bg but assumes grid is rectangular; special processing assumes a "frame" structure with right-side 9 markers and left uniform; 9-presence check is on the raw subgrid before modifications; trimming after padding/filling is crucial to remove extra space; global_max_r is the last row with any non-bg to detect "ground level"; size >=2 avoids single cells; in process_normal, 4-removal uses global positions for detection but modifies local subgrid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns [[bg]]; uneven widths in concatenation; potential overlap or adjacency not handled (assumes components are disjoint); if after trimming a subgrid is empty, discard it; vertical padding is not perfectly centered if height odd/even mismatch; trim_gap_columns only applies if exactly height 5 and checks middle row for bg gaps.
 * Potential misses: Not handling diagonal connections; assuming all objects are <=5 high (taller ones ignored implicitly); special fill uses a specific internal color, assuming it's the "body" color; no rotation or other transformations; output always exactly 5 rows, variable columns.

(These trimming functions are helpful for cleaning but may need refinement for non-frame gaps.)

def process_normal(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int], bg: int, global_max_r: int) -> List[List[int]]:

    # Handles standard object processing: 4-removal + adjacent bg-set, skip if near bottom or (9 and h<5), pad, trim.
    # Note: 4-detection uses global g, modification on local sub.
    return sub or []
```

```python
def process_special(g: List[List[int]], comp: Tuple[int, int, int, int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ... (full implementation)
    # Strict checks for frame: left uniform non-bg, right-top/bottom 9s; crops to w=4, fills interior with specific color, trims.
    return sub or []
```
(These are central to the logic but have bugs in application, as seen in outputs.)

Unhelpful or broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `contains_four` is defined but unused (dead code, remove); the global_max_r calculation in `program` finds the max row with any non-bg, which is helpful but may miss multi-row ground if sparse.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, building on implied prior code for component extraction.
 * Worked: Correctly identifies connected components by color and bounding box; basic extraction and padding to 5 rows; attempts to sort by position (min_c then min_r) for left-to-right/top-to-bottom ordering; handles bg exclusion and size/height filters; special case detection for 9s and partial implementation of frame filling.
 * Did not work: In training example 1, generated a symmetric 5x9 grid with 8s as bg?, misplaced 1/2/3 components without the left 6-frame (with 9s at [0,2] and [4,2]), wrong widths (e.g., no 4-column left frame, 3s blob too narrow), and 6s only on edges instead of integrated; expected has wider output with explicit 6-frame on left, then 1-blob with internal 4 (but 4 should be removed?), then separated 2/3 parts—suggests special processing failed to extract/position the 9-marked frame properly, and normal components concatenated without gaps or correct trimming.
 * In training example 2, generated a 5x24 grid with fragmented placements (e.g., 4s and 1s scattered, 3/5/6/8 mixed oddly, long bg runs), but expected is 5x22 with grouped 4-frames, internal 1/2/3/5/6/8 structures, and a right-side 1-blob with 4s—indicates wrong component grouping (e.g., treated adjacent different colors as separate but concatenated poorly), failed to skip/process bottom elements correctly (global_max_r skip not applied right), and trimming/padding left extra columns or merged unrelated parts; widths and positions mismatch (e.g., generated has extra 4s on top/bottom not in expected).
 * Overall: Component detection works for isolation but fails in processing (e.g., 4-removal not evident in outputs, special frames not cropped/filled correctly, leading to missing or malformed elements); sorting collects but concatenation ignores relative vertical spacing; no handling for overlapping bounds or multi-object per column; train outputs show over-trimming or under-extraction (e.g., unknown reason for 8s dominance in train1, possibly bg misdetect); helpful extraction functions like get_same_color_components are solid but process_normal/special need fixes for 9/4 logic and positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x37 grid (very wide) dominated by 3s (likely a large component not trimmed or split properly), with scattered 1/6/7/8/2 elements in narrow bands, but includes unprocessed 3-blobs on bottom/top and irregular placements (e.g., row 2 has long 1/6/7/8/3 runs without clear object separation, row 3 has isolated 6/8/2/7 amid 1/3). This suggests over-extraction of a massive 3-component (not filtered by height or near-bottom skip), poor trimming (full-bg columns not removed, gaps not handled), and failed special processing (possible 9s in input not triggering frames, leading to bloated width). Expected should be narrower, cleaner 5-row concatenation of distinct objects (e.g., left-to-right frames/blobs with removed 4s, padded internals, no ground 3s), likely around 20-30 columns with grouped colors like 1/6 on left, 2/7/8 in middle, trimmed 3s on right—but generated is messy and doesn't resemble a stylized scene, missing vertical alignment and having unknown extra 3-fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting distinct "objects" (connected components of the same non-background color) and special "frames" (vertical 5-high bars marked by 9's at the ends) from an input grid, processing them by padding short ones to 5 rows high, trimming background edges, sorting by their original leftmost column and top row position, and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid. The background color is determined from the top-left cell, and certain components (those containing 9 or 4 if shorter than 5 rows) are skipped to avoid noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same color, excluding background; only include those with height <=5 and size >=2 to filter small noise.
 * Special frames are exactly 5 rows high vertical uniform-color bars (not background) with a matching 9 in the same column on both top and bottom rows to the right of the bar, defining the right boundary; the interior (rows 1-3, columns after the bar) should be filled with a detected color (or default 1 if none), and the frame may need horizontal padding to width 5 if short.
 * Skip any component shorter than 5 rows if it contains 9 (likely frame markers) or 4 (possibly a special forbidden element) to prevent including partial or invalid shapes.
 * Pad vertically centered with background for short components to reach exactly 5 rows; after padding/processing, trim leading/trailing background columns from each object to minimize width.
 * Sort all valid processed objects (regular + special frames) by a key of (leftmost_column, top_row) in the original grid, then place them left-to-right in the output, filling a 5xN grid where N is the total trimmed width; if no objects, output a single background cell.
 * Background is always the top-left cell's color (e.g., 8 in train1, 4 in train2, likely 3 in test); objects must not include background pixels except for padding/trimming.
 * Subtle: Special frames mark visited areas to avoid double-processing; regular components use flood-fill but respect visited marks from frames.
 * Easy to miss: Frames may have empty or single-color fills, default to 1 if no other color found; extraction must handle out-of-bounds with background; output must be exactly 5 rows, no vertical trimming.
 * Components spanning >5 rows are ignored (only <=5 height); horizontal spans can vary but are trimmed.
 * In examples, output rearranges objects in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom start positions), potentially reordering from input layout.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt identifies connected components via flood-fill and special 5-high frames marked by 9's, pads/trims them, and sorts/concatenates into 5 rows, which is a good structural match for the puzzle but fails on specifics.
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated a 5x13 grid starting with horizontal 8's and including misplaced 6's/9's/3's/2's/1's/4's; expected is 5x12 with vertical 6-bar on left, internal 1's/4, then 2-blob, then 3-shapes—generated mismatches by including extra 8's as objects, wrong ordering (e.g., 3-shapes before 6-bar), and no proper frame extraction for the 6/9 structure (unknown why 8's dominate left side).
 * In training example 2 (bg=4), generated a bloated 5x30 grid with repeated 4's/6's/1's/2's/3's/5's/8's in wrong positions and extra widths (e.g., long 4-runs not trimmed); expected is 5x22 with cleaner objects like 4-frames, 1/2-blobs, 3/5/6/8 shapes—generated includes untrimmed bg columns, processes too many overlapping/invalid components (e.g., skips 9/4 rule fails), and wrong sorting (e.g., 6's appear early but should be mid-right).
 * find_special_frames detects vertical bars and 9-markers but over-pads horizontally with fill_color (defaults to 1 incorrectly in empty cases), marks visited incorrectly (up to right_c inclusive, potentially overlapping), and assumes fixed width=5 post-padding which isn't in expected.
 * get_components works for bounding boxes but includes small/noisy components or those >5 high indirectly (via h<=5 check), and doesn't handle diagonal connections (correctly 4-connected).
 * Overall, attempt over-extracts (too wide outputs), misorders (keys not sorting left-to-right properly), and mishandles specials (e.g., no fill detection in train1 leads to bg-flooded frames).
 * extract_subgrid and pad_vertical/trim_subgrid are helpful and mostly correct but fail when subgrids include bg internally without trimming.
 * contains_val is useful for skip logic but applied too late (after extraction).
 * The main program skeleton (bg detection, visited matrix, sort by key, horizontal concat) is a strong base but needs fixes for frame filling, skip conditions, and visited propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x37 grid (overly wide) dominated by 3's (likely bg) mixed with scattered 1's/6's/8's/7's/2's, forming messy untrimmed shapes like long 3-runs and partial objects (e.g., row0 has 21 3's then 8/3/9/etc.); this does not look correct as it appears to include vast bg areas as "objects" without proper trimming, includes probable invalid components (e.g., 9's suggesting unskipped frames, 4's absent but 7/2 may be noise), and lacks clean separated shapes—expected should be narrower (e.g., 5x15-25?) with distinct padded/trimmed objects like vertical bars (possibly 6/8), blobs (1/2/7), sorted by position, but here everything is jumbled with bg leaks, suggesting broken component detection (flood-fill grabs too much) and no effective skip for short/9-containing parts.
 * Specifically, test input seems to have bg=3, with objects like left 1/6-shapes, mid 8/7/2-clusters, right 8/3/6-frames—generated mangles this into unseparated mess (e.g., row2 has 1,6,1,8,6,1,3's,7,8's,2's,1,6,1,7,8,3's,1,7,1,1,7,1,6,8 vs. expected clean extracts), confirming over-extraction and poor sorting/trimming.
 * To handle test, must improve frame detection (e.g., better 9-matching and fill_color from actual interior, not default), stricter component size/filtering (e.g., skip if contains 9/4 even if h=5), and ensure visited prevents bg-inclusion.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction, processing, and rearrangement of connected components (like blobs or frames) from an input grid into a standardized 5-row output grid, where components are sorted by their vertical position (prioritizing those lower in the grid) and horizontal position, with gaps added between them and special handling for "frames" defined by vertical bars and markers (9's). The goal is to reconstruct a clean, combined image of these components without backgrounds, ensuring shapes, positions, and fills match the expected layout while ignoring invalid or background elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from the top-left cell; all extractions must pad or trim relative to this to avoid including irrelevant space.
 * Special frames are vertical 5-high bars (non-bg, non-9) with 9 markers at top/bottom on the right side; these require extracting a subgrid, filling inner areas (rows 1-3) with the most common non-bg/non-9 color if needed, and extending width if under 4 columns.
 * Normal components are connected groups of same-color cells (4-directional connectivity), but only if height <=5, size >=2, no 4's inside, and for height<5 no 9's unless already 5-high; pad vertically to 5 rows if shorter, centering with bg.
 * Trim subgrids horizontally to remove leading/trailing bg columns, but only after padding; empty trimmed results are discarded.
 * Sort all components (special and normal) by descending max_row (lower in grid first), then ascending min_col (left to right); process in this order to build the output row-by-row.
 * Between components, if there's a gap (>0 columns apart), insert exactly 2 columns: bg everywhere except possibly middle row (r=2) filled with previous component's fill color if it was a special frame.
 * Global max_r is the lowest non-bg row to limit component search vertically; components below global_max_r -3 are ignored.
 * Subtleties: Special frames mark visited cells to avoid overlap; inner fill for specials uses mode of non-bg/non-9 cells in rows 1-3; normals skip if they contain 4 (possibly a forbidden color/marker) or invalid 9's; output starts empty 5 rows and extends horizontally only with components/gaps—no fixed width.
 * Easy to miss: Gaps only add 2 columns, not the full original gap; specials extend/fill to at least 4 wide internally; visited tracking prevents double-extraction; if no components, output single bg cell.
 * Considerations: Grids may have irregular heights/widths; components can't overlap in extraction but can be adjacent; output must exactly match expected shapes, including any extended fills or paddings.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies bg, extracts subgrids with padding/trimming, finds connected components via flood-fill with visited tracking, and sorts by bottom-to-top then left-to-right, which works for basic structure and gap detection.
 * It handles special frames by detecting vertical bars and 9-markers, filling inners with mode color, and extending width— this seems partially correct but over-applies filling in train1, leading to merged/incorrect shapes.
 * Normal components are found with 4-dir connectivity, skipping invalid ones (with 4's or misplaced 9's), and padded to 5 rows, but the size>=2 and height limits help avoid noise yet miss some valid short components in train2.
 * Sorting key (-max_r, min_c) prioritizes lower/left components correctly, and gap-adding logic (2 cols, optional middle fill) is a good attempt but fails in train1 by not inserting enough gaps or padding, resulting in only 10 cols vs expected 12.
 * In train1, generated output compresses the middle components (e.g., the 1-4-1 shape and 2-3 shapes are squished without proper 2-col gaps of 8's), and the right side lacks extension to match expected wider layout; unknown why the 2-3 blob isn't separated properly.
 * In train2, generated output creates a massive 24-col mess with all components jammed together without gaps or proper separation (e.g., 1-2-1 and 3's are concatenated directly, and bottom row is all 4's incorrectly), completely mismatching the expected 22-col structured layout with distinct sections (e.g., 6's on right, separated 1-3-4 groups); this suggests over-extraction or failure to trim/ignore large bg areas.
 * Function find_special_frames is helpful for bar detection and filling but buggy in width extension (appends bg then overwrites only inner rows, potentially leaving uneven edges).
 * Function find_normal_components is essential for blob extraction but too permissive on global_max_r limiting, causing train2 to include extraneous bottom elements; the stack-based flood-fill is correct but doesn't handle diagonal connections (good, as it's 4-dir).
 * Overall, the program builds a 5-row result incrementally, which works, but visited marking skips too much in specials, leading to missed normals; no unhelpful functions, but the gap-filling val logic (only middle row if prev special) is subtle and often applies bg wrongly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x43 grid that's excessively wide and chaotic, with long stretches of 3's (likely bg=3) dominating and components like 1-6-7-8 blobs jammed together without clear separation or trimming (e.g., rows 1-4 have overlapping 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's in a non-sensical merged way, and bottom row is all 3's except scattered).
 * It fails to properly extract and isolate components: for example, what should be distinct vertical frames or blobs (possibly with 8 as bars and 9's implied) are concatenated directly, creating runs like [8,1,1,1,3,3,...] that don't match any expected clean rearrangement.
 * Gaps are missing entirely (no 2-col bg separations), and vertical padding/trimming seems absent, leading to uneven heights implicitly merged; the presence of 7's and 6's scattered suggests partial special/normal detection but wrong sorting/placement (e.g., lower components not prioritized).
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as outputs should be compact 5-row composites of trimmed components with gaps, not a sprawling untrimmed dump—likely over-extracting or failing to discard invalid components below global_max_r.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity), process each by extracting minimal bounding subgrids, handling special border/frame removal for full-height objects, padding shorter objects vertically to 5 rows with background, sorting objects left-to-right by their leftmost column then top row, and concatenating the processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid filled with background elsewhere.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at grid[0][0], and objects are any connected (up/down/left/right) non-background pixels; diagonal connections do not count.
 * Only process components with height <=5; taller ones (e.g., vertical bars spanning all rows) should be omitted entirely as they are likely dividers or non-objects.
 * Sort components primarily by minimum column (left position), secondarily by minimum row (top position) to ensure left-to-right, then top-to-bottom ordering.
 * For components of height <5, extract the tight bounding box and pad vertically with background rows (centered if possible, but code uses floor division which may not center perfectly).
 * For height=5 components, detect and handle "frames" or borders: if top and bottom rows share a non-bg color column (especially if it's 9, possibly a special frame color), remove or shift the border—code attempts right-side removal for color 9 or left-shift for others, but this is buggy and doesn't match expectations.
 * Output is always exactly 5 rows, with columns concatenated from processed subgrids (no gaps); total width is sum of subgrid widths, all else filled with bg.
 * Subtle: Objects may touch borders or each other without merging if not connected; frames might be asymmetric (left vs right) or require cropping specific columns; expected outputs are shorter, suggesting over-inclusion of bg areas or unremoved frames in generated results.
 * Ensure subgrid extraction doesn't include extra bg padding horizontally unless needed for alignment; vertical padding should not alter widths.
 * Potential misses: Overly wide subgrids due to loose bounding boxes including bg; incorrect frame detection leading to partial removal or shifts; sorting may place vertical bars incorrectly if not omitted.

                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                # Omit if height >5 (e.g., full vertical bars)
                if max_r - min_r + 1 <= 5:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c))
    return components
```
This DFS-based component finder with bounding box calculation is essential and mostly correct, but should filter height >5 inside the loop to avoid processing tall dividers.

```python
def sort_components(components: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(components, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))  # Sort by min_c (left), then min_r (top)
```
Correct sorting logic for left-to-right ordering.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 for train1, 4 for train2) and finds connected components, but fails to omit tall vertical components (e.g., the left 6-column in train1 expected starts with 6 but generated includes extra left 8s; in train2, extra left 4s and wide bars are included).
 * Component bounding boxes are tight, but extraction for height=5 mishandles frames: in train1, it doesn't remove or shift a presumed left frame, leading to extra 8-filled columns on left and right (generated rows ~15 elems vs expected 12); the inner shape (1s,2s,3s) is preserved but misaligned.
 * For train1, generated has full top/bottom rows of 8s with a 6 in col12 and 9 at end, while expected crops to start with [6,8,9,...] and ends cleanly with 8s—no extra junk, and the 6 seems like a kept divider or partial object on left.
 * Train2 generated is overly wide (~29 elems) with duplicated 4-filled areas and unprocessed frames/bars on left/right, vs expected ~22 elems where left 4s are cropped, central shapes (1-8) are extracted cleanly, and right 1s/3s/4s are positioned without extras.
 * Vertical padding for shorter components works (centers roughly), but horizontal concatenation includes full subgrid widths without trimming bg-only columns, bloating output.
 * Frame handling in extract_sub is broken/not helpful: for height=5 and border_c=9, it removes right side and sets top/bottom to bg (but train1 expected keeps some structure); for other colors, it shifts left but doesn't match (e.g., train2 doesn't shift correctly, leaving extra 4s/6s).
 * Overall, attempt shows good component detection/sorting but fails on filtering tall objects, frame removal/shifting, and bg trimming, leading to wider, cluttered outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears jumbled and overly wide (16 elems per row), with apparent unprocessed vertical elements (e.g., left 4s/6s/1s look like included bars/dividers, and right 3s/4s are fragmented) and no clear separation of distinct objects like a central 7/8 shape or bottom 1/3/6 cluster.
 * It mixes what seem like 3-4 objects (left bar, central blob with 8s/7, right shapes with 2/4) but without proper frame removal (e.g., top/bottom 1s/3s look unshifted), and vertical padding is absent or incorrect (bottom row has extra 1/6/3 without alignment to 5 rows of clean objects).
 * Expected test output should likely be narrower (~10-12 elems?), starting with a cropped left element, cleanly extracted central object (perhaps removing 8-frame around 7), and sorted right shapes, all padded to 5 rows without bg bloat—current output includes too much, suggesting same issues as training (no tall omission, bad frame handling).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 5-row input grid where the task is to identify connected non-background components (blobs or objects), process them by extracting subgrids, handling special cases with 9's (likely frames or markers), padding to standardize height to 5 rows, trimming unnecessary background columns, sorting them by vertical and horizontal position (prioritizing certain rows), and concatenating them side-by-side into a new 5-row output grid that represents a combined or cleaned visualization of the objects in reading order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from g[0][0]; all components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of non-bg cells, filtered to height h <=5 and size >=2 to ignore noise or single cells.
 * Components with height <5 must be vertically padded to 5 rows with bg if they contain no 9's; if h=5 and contains 9's, apply special "framing" logic: detect 9's in top/bottom rows at edges (left or right) to either extend the subgrid and replace inner parts with 1's (right frame) or collapse to a minimal width-2 center with 1's (left frame); otherwise, use as-is.
 * Sorting uses a key based on the topmost row with non-bg non-9 cells (min_r_non9, negated for priority) and leftmost column (min_c), which seems intended for top-to-bottom then left-to-right but may invert vertical order due to negation (components lower on the grid sort first, potentially wrong for reading order).
 * After processing, trim leading/trailing full-bg columns from each padded subgrid (must check all 5 rows); if entirely bg after trim, discard the component.
 * Output concatenates processed subgrids horizontally into a 5-row grid with total width summing subgrid widths; if no valid components, return single-cell bg grid.
 * Subtle: 9's are treated as special (not part of main object, possibly frames); extraction must handle out-of-bounds by padding with bg, but code has a bug in extract_subgrid where it checks c < len(g[0]) unnecessarily since min_c/max_c are within bounds.
 * Subtle: Padding is centered vertically ((5-h)//2 top, remainder bottom); for h=5 with 9 frames, modifications like setting inner rows to 1's or collapsing width must preserve object integrity without introducing new bg or altering non-9 parts unexpectedly.
 * Easy to miss: Components may overlap or adjoin bg/9's; visited marking prevents double-counting; size counts only non-bg cells; sorting key ignores 9's in position calculation to focus on "content" rows.
 * Easy to miss: Output must exactly match expected shapes, including preserving all non-bg values unless explicitly modified (e.g., framing replaces with 1's); no rotation, mirroring, or reordering beyond sorting.
 * Considerations: Grids are always 5 rows, variable columns; multiple components per grid; test inputs may have irregular shapes, frames on left/right, or vertically stacked elements needing proper order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Basic and correct for determining background.

```python
def get_non_bg_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] != bg:
                min_r, max_r = i, i
                min_c, max_c = j, j
                size = 0
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                size += 1
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                            size += 1
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                if h <= 5 and size >= 2:
                    components.append((min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c, size))
    return components
```
Useful DFS-based connected component labeling; correctly computes bounding box and size; filters appropriately.

```python
def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= c < len(g[0]):
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub
```
Helpful for pulling out bounding box subgrids; the bounds check is redundant but harmless; extendable for frame expansion.

```python
def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    pad_top = (5 - h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded
```
Correct for centered vertical padding to 5 rows; essential for short components.

```python
def get_min_r_non9(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> int:
    min_r_non9 = None
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 9:
                if min_r_non9 is None or r < min_r_non9:
                    min_r_non9 = r
    return min_r_non9 if min_r_non9 is not None else min_r
```
Useful for sorting key: finds topmost row with actual content (ignoring 9 frames); subtle but key for position-based ordering.

```python
def contains_9(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(9 in row for row in sub)
```
Simple and effective for detecting if special frame handling is needed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies and bounds connected components, pads short ones vertically, and trims full-bg columns post-processing, which works for basic extraction and standardization.
 * Sorting logic partially works (incorporates position via min_r_non9 and min_c) but likely buggy due to negation in key=(-min_r_non9, min_c), causing potential bottom-to-top order instead of top-to-bottom, leading to misarranged components.
 * Component filtering (h<=5, size>=2) works to ignore noise but may miss edge cases where components touch grid edges or include 9's in size count (though 9's are non-bg).
 * 9-handling in process_component is attempted but flawed: for right-frame (9's at right edge top/bottom), it extends subgrid and sets inner rows[1:4] to 1's correctly in intent but may over-extend or not match expected shapes; for left-frame, it collapses to width-2 with 1's in center row only, which is incomplete (padded with bg but doesn't replicate full object); non-frame cases with 9's just use sub as-is, potentially including unwanted 9's.
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly mixes and truncates the left "3-blob" and "6-frame" components: it produces a 9-column output with 3's on left, 6's in middle, and partial 1/4/1 on right, but expected is 12-column with separated "6 with inner 1/4/1" on left (width ~6) and "2/3-blob" on right (width ~6), missing proper frame processing and sorting/concatenation alignment.
 * In training example 2, generated output is severely mismatched: 29-column jumbled mess with all components concatenated wrong (e.g., 4/5/3 shapes interleaved with 6/1/2/3/4), including untrimmed bg and incorrect widths/heights; expected is 22-column with clean separation of left "1/2/1 with 3/3/3 inner" (width 11?), middle "5/3/5 frame with 6/6 inner and 1/4 sides" (width ~7), and right small "3/4/1", showing failure in extraction, frame collapse, and trimming.
 * Overall, extraction works for bounding but subgrid processing distorts shapes (e.g., unknown reason for width mismatches and bg intrusions); concatenation sums widths correctly but order/content wrong.
 * No prior attempts, but this shows partial understanding of components/padding; unhelpful: the left-frame collapse in process_component is too aggressive (only sets center row to 1's width-2, ignores other rows); the right-frame extension assumes +1 column but may need more; sorting negation is likely broken.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (16-column, 5 rows) does not look correct: it appears as a single jumbled component with 3/4/2/1/6/8/7 mixed vertically/horizontally (e.g., row 0 has 3,2,3,2,3 then 4's/6's/1's/3's; row 2 has 4's/1/4's/3's/6's/1's/7/8), suggesting improper component separation, no padding/trimming, and possible inclusion of bg or 9's as content.
 * It differs from expected patterns in training (clean separated objects with frames processed to 1's/inners): here, no clear object boundaries (e.g., 7 and 8 at end look like unprocessed artifacts), widths don't align to discrete blobs, and vertical structure (e.g., row 4 all 3's/1/6/1) seems like a bottom-heavy untrimmed grid rather than concatenated padded subgrids.
 * Likely incorrect due to same issues as training: flawed 9-handling (if test has frames, not collapsed), wrong sorting (elements out of reading order), and extraction bugs (e.g., over-wide subgrids including adjacent bg); without input grid visualization, hard to confirm exact blobs, but output lacks the structured separation seen in expected trainings (e.g., no isolated "6 with 1/4 inner" or trimmed "3-blob").

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored or shaped cells, where the task is to detect, extract, and horizontally arrange connected components (objects) into a fixed 5-row output grid, treating "special frames" (bounded areas with vertical bars and 9-markers) differently by filling their interiors and adding gaps, while filtering out noise like small or invalid components. The arrangement sorts components top-to-bottom then left-to-right, padding shorter ones vertically and trimming excess background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected groups of the same non-background value, detected via flood-fill (stack-based DFS); background (bg) is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, but must handle empty grids gracefully.
 * Filter out small components (size < 2), overly tall ones (height >5), or those too low in the grid (e.g., min_r > global_max_r -3, where global_max_r is the lowest row with non-bg); also skip if they contain 9 (unless in special frames) with height <5, or contain 4 at all, to avoid noise or invalid objects.
 * Special frames: Detect vertical 5-cell bars (same color, non-bg) starting from rows 0 to rows-5, then find bounding columns via paired 9's in top/bottom rows of the frame; extract 5xN subgrid, fill inner areas (rows 1-3, cols 1+) with a uniform "inside" color from [1][1], mark frame cells as visited to avoid re-processing.
 * Normal components: After special detection, flood-fill unvisited non-bg cells; extract subgrid, pad vertically to 5 rows with bg (centered), trim left/right bg columns; only include if post-trim subgrid is non-empty.
 * Sorting: By descending min_r (top-first), then ascending min_c (left-to-right) for same row.
 * Building output: Start with 5 empty rows; for each component, optionally add 2-column gap after special ones (middle row filled with inside color, others bg); then append the (padded/trimmed) 5-row subgrid horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Assume one frame per bar (break after finding); global_max_r ignores all-bg rows at bottom; special frames override normal detection via visited marking; gaps only after special (previous_is_special flag); inside fill only for special, and only replaces bg in inner area (not overwriting existing non-bg); handle out-of-bounds in extraction with bg padding; output is always 5 rows, even if no components (single bg cell).
 * Easy to miss: 9's act as frame boundaries but are skipped in normal components if height<5; 4's are outright invalid (perhaps representing holes or errors); vertical padding is centered (uneven split if needed); trimming only horizontal (left/right), not vertical (after padding); components can be wider than tall, but height limits apply; no diagonal connectivity (only 4 directions).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0

def extract_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    sub = []
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        row = []
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:
                row.append(g[r][c])
            else:
                row.append(bg)
        sub.append(row)
    return sub

def pad_vertical(sub: List[List[int]], orig_h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not sub:
        return []
    pad_top = (5 - orig_h) // 2
    pad_bottom = 5 - orig_h - pad_top
    padded = [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
    return padded

def trim_subgrid(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not sub:
        return []
    h = len(sub)
    w = len(sub[0])
    left = 0
    while left < w and all(sub[r][left] == bg for r in range(h)):
        left += 1
    right = w - 1
    while right > left and all(sub[r][right] == bg for r in range(h)):
        right -= 1
    if left > right:
        return []
    return [row[left : right + 1] for row in sub]

def contains_value(sub: List[List[int]], val: int) -> bool:
    return any(val in row for row in sub)
```
* These are solid for subgrid extraction (handles OOB with bg), vertical centering pad to 5 rows, horizontal bg trim, and quick value checks (e.g., for 4 or 9 filtering).
* Component tuple type: Tuple[int, int, int, List[List[int]], bool, int] for (min_r, min_c, max_c, sub, is_special, inside_color) – useful for sorting and building.

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
* The special frame detection loop assumes bars start at start_c and scans right for 9-pairs only in row 0 and 4 of frame; it's brittle if 9's are not exactly paired or if frames overlap/nest (breaks after one per bar, may miss multiples).
* The inside fill in special frames only replaces bg with inside_color in rows 1-3, cols 1+ of sub – but uses len(sub[rr]) which is post-extraction width, potentially overwriting frame edges if not careful; also hardcoded to inside_color = g[start_r +1][start_c +1], assuming uniform inside.
* Global_max_r computation skips all-bg rows but uses max with default -1; if entire grid is bg, it leads to empty output – but program handles with [[bg]] fallback, though filtering min_r > global_max_r -3 may exclude valid low components if global_max_r is low.
* Visited marking in special frames marks the entire subgrid row-wise, but only if nc in bounds – minor, but could leak if max_c_comp > cols.
* Normal component flood-fill updates min/max during stack pop (correct), but size count includes start; filter h = max_r - min_r +1 >5 skips tall, but after pad it's always 5, so filter before pad.
* Building result uses previous_is_special to add gap before next component, but no initial gap; if first is special, no leading gap (may be correct, but check if expected has leading space).
* No diagonal directions in flood-fill (good, 4-connectivity), but may merge diagonal objects incorrectly if puzzle assumes 8-connectivity (unknown).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core detection/sorting/padding/trimming works for simple cases without special frames or with basic components.
 * Training example 2 failed: Generated a mostly flat/symmetric 5x20 grid with heavy 4's (bg?) and 8's as possible frames, plus small 1/2/3 inserts, but expected is asymmetric 5x22 with varied 1-8 numbers in distinct shapes (e.g., 6's in cols 12-14/20-22, 5's around 3's, 8's as frames?); generated ignored or misfiltered components (e.g., no 5/6, extra 4's everywhere), possibly over-trimming, wrong bg (4 instead of expected?), or failed special detection leading to no gaps/varied insides.
 * Sorting by (-min_r, min_c) worked for train1 but may have placed low components too early in train2, or special frames not detected (generated has 8's but not matching expected 8 positions).
 * Component filtering skipped too much in train2 (e.g., has_4 or has_9 rules eliminated valid objects with 4/9, or size/h filters too strict); generated has long 4-rows, suggesting untrimmed bg or all-components-as-bg fallback.
 * Special frame logic missed in train2: Expected has possible framed areas (e.g., 8's around 1/3/5/6), but generated filled with 4's/1's incorrectly; inside fill or 9-boundary detection broken for non-uniform insides.
 * Visited marking prevented double-counting in train1, but in train2 may have over-marked, skipping key components.
 * Gap addition only after special: Train2 generated no obvious gaps (continuous 4's/1's), suggesting no specials detected or flag not triggering.
 * Overall, attempt understood connected components and arrangement but broke on filtering/specials, leading to bg-flooded output; extract_subgrid/pad/trim are essential and worked, but flood-fill needs tighter bounds for min/max updates.
 * Unknown mismatch in train2 blob shapes: Generated 1/2/3 inserts are small/isolated vs expected connected 1-6 shapes; possibly wrong color grouping or post-trim distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a 5x37 grid with long horizontal stretches of 3's (rows 0/2/4 mostly 3's with 8 interruptions, row 1/3 mixed 1/3/6/7/8/2 but fragmented), suggesting over-extraction of a large 3-component or bg=3 with poor trimming, leading to concatenated bars/objects without proper separation or shape preservation (e.g., 8's as vertical frames but smeared horizontally, 7's/6's scattered like unfiltered noise).
 * Missing expected structure: No clear 5-row object arrangements with gaps; too many 3's imply wrong bg (if input bg isn't 3) or failed trim/pad, drowning small components (1/2/6/7 look like partial extracts but misaligned, e.g., 6's in row1 cols30-31/36-37 but isolated).
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution: Lacks the clean, side-by-side object layout seen in train2 expected (varied shapes, no uniform filler rows); likely special frames not handled (8's/7's as bars? but no inside fill/gaps), or filtering let in invalid tall/wide 3-blobs; to fix, verify input bg, tighten has_9/has_4 skips, ensure one-frame-per-bar doesn't miss multiples, and check post-build widths match expected (37 cols seems arbitrary vs train2's 22).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 01:05:44] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colored pixels, where the goal is to detect, extract, and rearrange specific "objects" or components (regular connected blobs and special "framed" structures) into a new standardized 5-row output grid, ordered left-to-right by their original column positions, while handling background padding, trimming, and special modifications like inner color fills or gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the dominant color (e.g., 4 or 3 in examples), detected from top-left; all extractions must pad or fill with bg to avoid artifacts.
 * Regular components are connected groups (4-directional adjacency) of the same non-bg color, with height <=5 and size >=2; skip if they contain 9 (marker for specials) or 4 (if bg !=4), and if they are too low in the grid (near global max row -3, possibly to avoid footers).
 * Special frames: Vertical bars of exactly 5 identical non-bg cells, followed immediately by a 9 in the same column on top and bottom rows (must align), defining a 5x3+ inner subgrid; modify inner rows (1-3) by filling the last column with the color from row1/col1 of the bar+1.
 * Horizontal grouping: Adjacent components (sharing column edges) are concatenated into wider objects before placement.
 * Assembly: Output is always 5 rows; place special groups first (with 2-column bg gaps, but middle row of gap filled with inner_color), then sorted normal groups; if empty, return single bg cell.
 * Subtleties: Vertical padding centers components to height 5 (top/bottom uneven if needed); horizontal trimming removes pure bg columns from sides; specials mark/visit areas to exclude from regular detection; global max row skips low components (avoids overlapping footers?); no rotation or diagonal connectivity; order by min column position.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return [[0]] or [[bg]]; out-of-bounds in extraction fills with bg; components with 9 or forbidden colors (like 4 when bg!=4) are omitted entirely; specials require exact 5-height bar and aligned 9's, no partials.
 * All attempts must preserve exact shapes/colors during extraction/concat; output rows must align perfectly (same length across rows).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled Training example 1 (full match, proper extraction/ordering of components and specials).
 * Failed Training example 2: Generated output has extra/misplaced elements (e.g., wide 6/3/5 patterns on left, duplicated 1/3/8 on right, total width ~30 vs expected ~22; includes untrimmed or wrongly grouped blobs like horizontal 8's and 4's that should be omitted/skipped; specials likely misdetected, leading to asymmetric placement without proper gaps; low components not skipped correctly, causing footer bleed).
 * Special frame detection works for simple cases but fails when 9's are not immediate or bars have inner variations (e.g., may extract partial inners or miss alignments, leading to overfilled subs).
 * Regular components correctly flood-fill but filtering is inconsistent (e.g., includes 4-blobs when bg=4? or 9-containing ones; global max_r skip misses subtle overlaps).
 * build_groups/concat_subgrids helpful for adjacency but assumes perfect column+1 alignment, may split wrongly if gaps exist.
 * Gap insertion in specials (bg with inner_color in row 2) is attempted but misplaces in train2 (e.g., wrong inner_color or position).
 * Visited marking for specials prevents double-count but may overmark if orig_max_c includes extras beyond 9's.
 * pad_vertical/trim_subgrid essential and work well, but applied post-filtering leads to empty trimmed if bg-dominant.
 * Function `contains_value` is helpful for quick 9/4 checks but simplistic (doesn't distinguish positions).
 * Unused `directions = []` in find_special_frames is broken/not helpful (remove in future).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces 5 rows with inconsistent widths (e.g., row0/4 ~37 elems of mostly 3/bg with scattered 8's, row1/3 ~37 with mixed 1/6/8/7/3/2, row2 ~37 with dense patterns), but lacks clear object separation/grouping—appears to concat everything without proper trimming/filtering (e.g., huge horizontal 3/8 bars suggest untrimmed full rows or missed bg=3; specials like 8-frames with 9's? not isolated; low 2/7 blobs included wrongly; no centering/padding evident, leading to asymmetric/unstandardized shapes; expected should be narrower, ordered components like isolated 1/6/8 groups with gaps, totaling ~20-30 elems max, symmetric top/bottom).
 * Differs from expected (mentally: test grid has bg=3, vertical 1/6/8 bars, horizontal 3/8/2 fills, possible specials around col10-20 with 9-markers?); generated includes all non-bg without omission (e.g., bottom 3-rows of 3's as "components"), misgroups adjacents (e.g., 8's spanning unrelated areas), and fails vertical skip (includes footer 3's); output is bloated/noisy, not a clean rearranged puzzle solution.
