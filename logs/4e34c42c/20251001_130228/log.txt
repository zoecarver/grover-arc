=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 13:02:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 13:21:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 13:30:44] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

    # Broken/not general: Fails when patterns don't match exact conditions, leading to asymmetric or incomplete shapes.
    # Do not reuse without generalization.
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

[2025-10-01 13:30:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

    # Do not reuse without generalization.

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 13:37:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

[2025-10-01 13:37:25] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (the only complete examples for verifying consistency), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, holes, pixels, bbox dimensions/position) that demonstrably link components in *every* train puzzle (both 1 and 2), appearing in the same way across inputs and preserved in outputs. Only direct, observable links (e.g., positional containment, adjacency affecting structure) are included—no high-level interpretations, forced semantics, or elements without cross-example consistency (e.g., Orange-Green alternation is train2-only; Light Blue positioning varies and is absent in train2; large background transformations are unknown). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone small Green p=2 in train2 without links) are excluded. Where a transformation cannot be explained from properties alone, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Red (holes=0, pixels=1, bbox 1x1) positioned inside holed host (holes=1, pixels=8, bbox ~3x3 units)**:  
   - In every train input, small Red single-pixel elements are contained within the bbox of a larger host shape (bbox width/height 2-3 units, area ~9 units), where the host has exactly 1 hole and pixels=8 (consistent with ~1 missing unit in a near-full 3x3 grid). Host color varies (Green in train1; Blue in train2), but the positional containment and property match (Red at approximate center of host, e.g., [14,8] in [13,7-15,9]; [2,4] in [1,3-3,5]) is identical, suggesting Red interacts with the host's hole (e.g., occupancy or blocking).  
   - This pairing (2 instances per train) is preserved in every output: Red remains inside the same host (e.g., output1: Red [10,2] in Green [9,1-11,3]; output2: Red [1,2] in Blue [0,1-2,3]), with no change to holes/pixels/relative position. No other colors show this exact containment consistently.

2. **Yellow (holes=0, pixels=1-2, bbox 1x1 or 2x1 horizontal) positioned inside Blue (holes=0 or 1, pixels=5-18, bbox >3x3 units)**:  
   - In every train input, small Yellow elements (single pixel or 2-pixel horizontal bar) are contained within the bbox of a larger Blue shape (wider/taller bbox, e.g., 4x3 or 6x5 units), positioned internally without overlapping edges (e.g., train1: Yellow [6,8] in Blue [6,7-9,9]; [22,13] in [21,12-22,14]; train2: Yellow [11,3-12,3] and [14,3-15,3] in Blue [11,1-16,5]). This links Yellow as an internal accent to Blue's linking structure (Blue often has internal details or connectors). 2 instances per train.  
   - Preserved in every output: Yellow stays inside Blue with matching relative position and pixels (e.g., output1: Yellow [2,2] in Blue [1,1-5,3]; output2: Yellow [19,2-20,2] in Blue [16,0-21,4]; [16,2-17,2] at edge of same Blue). Blue's holes (if present) unaffected by Yellow placement.

3. **Pink (holes=0, pixels=5 or 12, bbox width 1 or ~4 units x height exactly 5 units) adjacent to Blue (various pixels/bbox) and small p=1 elements**:  
   - In every train input, Pink forms a vertical or near-vertical rectangle (consistent height 5 units, thin or wider fill; e.g., train1: [20,11-20,15] width1; train2: [3,23-6,27] width~4), positioned adjacent (bbox edges touching or overlapping by 1 unit) to a Blue component and 1-2 small p=1 elements of other colors (e.g., Light Blue/Yellow in train1; Orange/Green in train2). This creates a bordering interaction, where Pink's edges align with Blue's side for enclosure (no overlap, but shared y-range). 1 instance per train.  
   - Preserved in every output: Pink retains height=5 units and pixels, with adjacency to Blue and small elements (e.g., output1: Pink [0,0-0,4] adjacent to Blue [1,1-5,3] and Yellow [2,2]; output2: Pink [11,0-14,4] adjacent to Blue [16,0-21,4] and small Yellow/Green/Orange). Position shifts to linear assembly edge, but adjacency property consistent. Unknown: Exact width-to-fill transformation (e.g., sparse to solid).

4. **Large enclosing component (various colors, holes=3 or 4, pixels=~500-513, bbox full field ~20x20+ units) contains all small components by position**:  
   - In every train input, a single large component (Maroon in train1; Yellow in train2) spans the full bbox (0,0 to ~24x22 or 19x29), with high holes (3-4) and high pixels, containing *all* other components' bboxes internally (no overlap, but full enclosure; e.g., all small bboxes within [0,0-24,22] in train1). This positional containment links it as a static frame to all interactive small elements (colors, holes, adjacency as above unaffected).  
   - Inconsistent in outputs: Large component absent entirely (no matching color/holes/pixels/bbox), with small elements reassembled linearly without enclosure. Unknown: How this positional containment transforms to linear assembly (no preserved properties observable).

No other interactions (e.g., Maroon bar orientation, Green chain formation, bbox y-position to color shift) are consistent across both trains—variations in color, size, or transformation prevent inclusion. Test inputs show similar patterns (e.g., Dark Red p=1 inside holed Yellow p=8 bbox 3x3 in test2), but cannot verify output consistency.

[2025-10-01 13:39:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core component extraction via DFS (helpful, as it correctly identifies connected non-bg regions)
def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform bg color from top-left
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(comp) >= 10:
                    components.append(comp)
    return components
```

```python
# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

        return padded
    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

        pad_top = (5 - h) // 2

        return padded
    return sub
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on unique non-bg values (<=3 incl. 4 or single 8); over-specific to numbers, causes incorrect trimming in train2 (e.g., removes parts of main object).
    # Broken/not general: Fails when patterns don't match exact conditions, leading to asymmetric or incomplete shapes.
    # Do not reuse without generalization.
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (the only complete examples for verifying consistency), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, holes, pixels, bbox dimensions/position) that demonstrably link components in *every* train puzzle (both 1 and 2), appearing in the same way across inputs and preserved in outputs. Only direct, observable links (e.g., positional containment, adjacency affecting structure) are included—no high-level interpretations, forced semantics, or elements without cross-example consistency (e.g., Orange-Green alternation is train2-only; Light Blue positioning varies and is absent in train2; large background transformations are unknown). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone small Green p=2 in train2 without links) are excluded. Where a transformation cannot be explained from properties alone, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Red (holes=0, pixels=1, bbox 1x1) positioned inside holed host (holes=1, pixels=8, bbox ~3x3 units)**:  
   - In every train input, small Red single-pixel elements are contained within the bbox of a larger host shape (bbox width/height 2-3 units, area ~9 units), where the host has exactly 1 hole and pixels=8 (consistent with ~1 missing unit in a near-full 3x3 grid). Host color varies (Green in train1; Blue in train2), but the positional containment and property match (Red at approximate center of host, e.g., [14,8] in [13,7-15,9]; [2,4] in [1,3-3,5]) is identical, suggesting Red interacts with the host's hole (e.g., occupancy or blocking).  
   - This pairing (2 instances per train) is preserved in every output: Red remains inside the same host (e.g., output1: Red [10,2] in Green [9,1-11,3]; output2: Red [1,2] in Blue [0,1-2,3]), with no change to holes/pixels/relative position. No other colors show this exact containment consistently.

2. **Yellow (holes=0, pixels=1-2, bbox 1x1 or 2x1 horizontal) positioned inside Blue (holes=0 or 1, pixels=5-18, bbox >3x3 units)**:  
   - In every train input, small Yellow elements (single pixel or 2-pixel horizontal bar) are contained within the bbox of a larger Blue shape (wider/taller bbox, e.g., 4x3 or 6x5 units), positioned internally without overlapping edges (e.g., train1: Yellow [6,8] in Blue [6,7-9,9]; [22,13] in [21,12-22,14]; train2: Yellow [11,3-12,3] and [14,3-15,3] in Blue [11,1-16,5]). This links Yellow as an internal accent to Blue's linking structure (Blue often has internal details or connectors). 2 instances per train.  
   - Preserved in every output: Yellow stays inside Blue with matching relative position and pixels (e.g., output1: Yellow [2,2] in Blue [1,1-5,3]; output2: Yellow [19,2-20,2] in Blue [16,0-21,4]; [16,2-17,2] at edge of same Blue). Blue's holes (if present) unaffected by Yellow placement.

3. **Pink (holes=0, pixels=5 or 12, bbox width 1 or ~4 units x height exactly 5 units) adjacent to Blue (various pixels/bbox) and small p=1 elements**:  
   - In every train input, Pink forms a vertical or near-vertical rectangle (consistent height 5 units, thin or wider fill; e.g., train1: [20,11-20,15] width1; train2: [3,23-6,27] width~4), positioned adjacent (bbox edges touching or overlapping by 1 unit) to a Blue component and 1-2 small p=1 elements of other colors (e.g., Light Blue/Yellow in train1; Orange/Green in train2). This creates a bordering interaction, where Pink's edges align with Blue's side for enclosure (no overlap, but shared y-range). 1 instance per train.  
   - Preserved in every output: Pink retains height=5 units and pixels, with adjacency to Blue and small elements (e.g., output1: Pink [0,0-0,4] adjacent to Blue [1,1-5,3] and Yellow [2,2]; output2: Pink [11,0-14,4] adjacent to Blue [16,0-21,4] and small Yellow/Green/Orange). Position shifts to linear assembly edge, but adjacency property consistent. Unknown: Exact width-to-fill transformation (e.g., sparse to solid).

4. **Large enclosing component (various colors, holes=3 or 4, pixels=~500-513, bbox full field ~20x20+ units) contains all small components by position**:  
   - In every train input, a single large component (Maroon in train1; Yellow in train2) spans the full bbox (0,0 to ~24x22 or 19x29), with high holes (3-4) and high pixels, containing *all* other components' bboxes internally (no overlap, but full enclosure; e.g., all small bboxes within [0,0-24,22] in train1). This positional containment links it as a static frame to all interactive small elements (colors, holes, adjacency as above unaffected).  
   - Inconsistent in outputs: Large component absent entirely (no matching color/holes/pixels/bbox), with small elements reassembled linearly without enclosure. Unknown: How this positional containment transforms to linear assembly (no preserved properties observable).

No other interactions (e.g., Maroon bar orientation, Green chain formation, bbox y-position to color shift) are consistent across both trains—variations in color, size, or transformation prevent inclusion. Test inputs show similar patterns (e.g., Dark Red p=1 inside holed Yellow p=8 bbox 3x3 in test2), but cannot verify output consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

[2025-10-01 13:48:15] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data from both training examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** example (both Train 1 and Train 2 inputs/outputs) without forcing unsubstantiated links. I focused on direct, verifiable relations like preservation of shape/size under relocation, adjacency-based connections that persist or transform consistently, and property mappings (e.g., position to color or holes to position) that hold across all cases. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background green, which has no interaction) are excluded. Inconsistent or one-off elements (e.g., Light Blue singles in Train 1 only, Orange in Train 2 only, or variable hole counts in Greens) are excluded. Transformations that cannot be explained without speculation (e.g., how non-holed Blues in Train 1 input become holed in output, or disassembly of large blocks) are noted as unknown.

1. **Pink blocks -> Position relocation (preservation of shape and size)**: Pink blocks consistently maintain their exact pixels count, holes=0, and bbox dimensions (e.g., vertical/thin in Train 1 with pixels=5, width=1 height=4; wider enclosure-like in Train 2 with pixels=12, width=3 height=4). They are relocated to new positions in the output without rotation, scaling, or modification. This suggests a direct position -> position mapping for Pink, unaffected by other elements. No color or hole change.

2. **Pink blocks <-> Blue blocks (adjacency interaction affecting position)**: In every output, Pink blocks are consistently adjacent to Blue blocks (sharing bbox edges, e.g., x-overlap or y-overlap by 1 unit). This adjacency effects their relative positioning in the transformation: Pink acts as a connector, placing Blue immediately to its right or integrated nearby. In inputs, this adjacency is not always present (present in Train 1, absent in Train 2), but the output interaction is consistent, implying Blue position is influenced by Pink's relocation. No change to holes or pixels in either.

3. **Yellow small blocks (pixels ≤2) -> Position relocation (preservation of size)**: Small Yellow blocks (holes=0, pixels=1 in Train 1; pixels=2 horizontal bars in Train 2) are consistently preserved in size and holes=0, but repositioned in output. This is a position -> position mapping, often placing them adjacent to Green or Blue for enclosure-like effects (e.g., inside or next to holed structures). Larger Yellow (e.g., bars pixels=4+ or the holed large block in Train 2) show unknown transformation (possibly broken into bars, but inconsistent with Train 1 lacking large Yellow).

4. **Red small blocks (pixels=1) <-> Green blocks (containment interaction affecting position)**: Single-pixel Red blocks (holes=0, pixels=1) are consistently preserved and repositioned inside or adjacent to Green blocks in outputs where Green appears (bbox overlap or edge-sharing). This containment effects Red's position: it "fills" or highlights Green structures. In Train 1 inputs, this is present (Red inside holed Green); in Train 2, it's adjacent in input/output but not always contained. The output interaction holds consistently, but input varies—suggesting Green influences Red placement during transformation. Larger Red (pixels>1) shows unknown interaction (preserved in Train 1, absent in Train 2 output).

5. **Maroon blocks -> Structural support (position -> color adjacency with Pink/Yellow)**: Small Maroon blocks (holes=0, pixels=3 vertical bars in Train 2; derived small bars pixels=1-12 in Train 1 output) consistently end up as horizontal/vertical supports in output, adjacent to Pink or Yellow (bbox edge-sharing). This effects a position -> color mapping: Maroon provides enclosure around Pink/Yellow relocations. The large holed Maroon in Train 1 input encompasses all small elements (bbox containment), influencing their extraction/relocation; similar containment by large Yellow in Train 2. However, the large block's own transformation to small supports is unknown (disassembly not verifiable consistently).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., hole count -> color changes are inconsistent; Green accents vary too much in size/holes; Blue large blocks preserve size/holes=1 in Train 2 but emerge newly in Train 1 output—unknown origin). Test inputs follow similar patterns (e.g., Pink preservation, small Red/Yellow relocation, large holed block containment) but cannot confirm outputs for full consistency.

[2025-10-01 13:49:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core component extraction via DFS (helpful, as it correctly identifies connected non-bg regions)
def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform bg color from top-left
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(comp) >= 10:
                    components.append(comp)
    return components
```

```python
# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

    # Centers and pads/crops subgrid to exactly 5 rows with bg fill; preserves width.

        padded = [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
        return padded
    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on unique non-bg values (<=3 incl. 4 or single 8); over-specific to numbers, causes incorrect trimming in train2 (e.g., removes parts of main object).
    # Broken/not general: Fails when patterns don't match exact conditions, leading to asymmetric or incomplete shapes.
    # Do not reuse without generalization.
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data from both training examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** example (both Train 1 and Train 2 inputs/outputs) without forcing unsubstantiated links. I focused on direct, verifiable relations like preservation of shape/size under relocation, adjacency-based connections that persist or transform consistently, and property mappings (e.g., position to color or holes to position) that hold across all cases. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background green, which has no interaction) are excluded. Inconsistent or one-off elements (e.g., Light Blue singles in Train 1 only, Orange in Train 2 only, or variable hole counts in Greens) are excluded. Transformations that cannot be explained without speculation (e.g., how non-holed Blues in Train 1 input become holed in output, or disassembly of large blocks) are noted as unknown.

1. **Pink blocks -> Position relocation (preservation of shape and size)**: Pink blocks consistently maintain their exact pixels count, holes=0, and bbox dimensions (e.g., vertical/thin in Train 1 with pixels=5, width=1 height=4; wider enclosure-like in Train 2 with pixels=12, width=3 height=4). They are relocated to new positions in the output without rotation, scaling, or modification. This suggests a direct position -> position mapping for Pink, unaffected by other elements. No color or hole change.

2. **Pink blocks <-> Blue blocks (adjacency interaction affecting position)**: In every output, Pink blocks are consistently adjacent to Blue blocks (sharing bbox edges, e.g., x-overlap or y-overlap by 1 unit). This adjacency effects their relative positioning in the transformation: Pink acts as a connector, placing Blue immediately to its right or integrated nearby. In inputs, this adjacency is not always present (present in Train 1, absent in Train 2), but the output interaction is consistent, implying Blue position is influenced by Pink's relocation. No change to holes or pixels in either.

3. **Yellow small blocks (pixels ≤2) -> Position relocation (preservation of size)**: Small Yellow blocks (holes=0, pixels=1 in Train 1; pixels=2 horizontal bars in Train 2) are consistently preserved in size and holes=0, but repositioned in output. This is a position -> position mapping, often placing them adjacent to Green or Blue for enclosure-like effects (e.g., inside or next to holed structures). Larger Yellow (e.g., bars pixels=4+ or the holed large block in Train 2) show unknown transformation (possibly broken into bars, but inconsistent with Train 1 lacking large Yellow).

4. **Red small blocks (pixels=1) <-> Green blocks (containment interaction affecting position)**: Single-pixel Red blocks (holes=0, pixels=1) are consistently preserved and repositioned inside or adjacent to Green blocks in outputs where Green appears (bbox overlap or edge-sharing). This containment effects Red's position: it "fills" or highlights Green structures. In Train 1 inputs, this is present (Red inside holed Green); in Train 2, it's adjacent in input/output but not always contained. The output interaction holds consistently, but input varies—suggesting Green influences Red placement during transformation. Larger Red (pixels>1) shows unknown interaction (preserved in Train 1, absent in Train 2 output).

5. **Maroon blocks -> Structural support (position -> color adjacency with Pink/Yellow)**: Small Maroon blocks (holes=0, pixels=3 vertical bars in Train 2; derived small bars pixels=1-12 in Train 1 output) consistently end up as horizontal/vertical supports in output, adjacent to Pink or Yellow (bbox edge-sharing). This effects a position -> color mapping: Maroon provides enclosure around Pink/Yellow relocations. The large holed Maroon in Train 1 input encompasses all small elements (bbox containment), influencing their extraction/relocation; similar containment by large Yellow in Train 2. However, the large block's own transformation to small supports is unknown (disassembly not verifiable consistently).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., hole count -> color changes are inconsistent; Green accents vary too much in size/holes; Blue large blocks preserve size/holes=1 in Train 2 but emerge newly in Train 1 output—unknown origin). Test inputs follow similar patterns (e.g., Pink preservation, small Red/Yellow relocation, large holed block containment) but cannot confirm outputs for full consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 13:57:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

        return padded
    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 13:58:02] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Properties

Based on the provided data from both training examples (inputs and outputs), I analyzed components for interactions or effects that are obvious, direct, and present in **every** case (Train 1 and Train 2). Interactions are limited to those with clear, repeatable patterns across positions, properties (e.g., holes, pixels, bbox adjacency or overlap implications), colors, or transformations. Only elements appearing in all inputs and outputs are considered (e.g., excluding Orange, Light Blue, Dark Red as they are absent in at least one full train pair). No high-level puzzle solving or irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., singleton small dots without cross-example ties) are included. Unknowns are noted where a property or transformation cannot be clearly linked without forcing.

#### 1. **Large Multi-Hole Shape → Horizontal Layered Bars (Color-Preserving Split)**
   - **Components Involved**: The dominant large shape (high pixels, multiple holes) in input (Maroon in Train 1, pixels=527, holes=3, bbox covering most canvas [0,0,24,22]; Yellow in Train 2, pixels=513, holes=4, bbox [0,0,19,29]).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: This shape's multi-hole property (holes ≥3) consistently transforms into multiple horizontal bars of the **same color** in output, forming layered base structures. Bars have reduced pixels per instance but maintain horizontal orientation (wide bbox in x, narrow in y).
     - Train 1 Output: Maroon bars ([3,0,11,1] pixels=12; [3,3,11,4] pixels=12), positioned as base layers.
     - Train 2 Output: Yellow bars ([0,0,10,1] pixels=18; [0,3,10,4] pixels=18; [14,0,17,0] pixels=4; [14,4,17,4] pixels=4), positioned as extended base layers.
   - **Properties Linking**: Hole count (multi-hole input) effects the multiplicity of output bars (≥2 bars); color preserved directly (Maroon → Maroon bars; Yellow → Yellow bars). Position effect: Input's full-canvas bbox implies output bars span horizontally across central/lower areas.
   - **Consistency**: Exact in both trains; no exceptions. Unknown: Exact pixel redistribution mechanism (total output pixels << input, possible cropping or overlap not explainable from data).

#### 2. **Pink Vertical/Hook → Side Framing Bars (Position → Position Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Pink shape in input (holes=0, vertical or L-ish bbox; Train 1: [20,11,20,15] pixels=5; Train 2: [3,23,6,27] pixels=12).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Pink's near-vertical bbox (tall y-span relative to x) consistently moves to frame the sides of the central output structure, preserving pixels and holes=0, but adjusting to stricter vertical alignment.
     - Train 1 Output: [0,0,0,4] pixels=5 (left frame).
     - Train 2 Output: [11,0,14,4] pixels=12 (right/middle frame).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input position (top-right or bottom in bbox) effects output position (shifts to left/right edges of canvas); shape property (hook/L to straight vertical bar). No color change.
   - **Consistency**: Present and transformed similarly in both; interacts with central structure by adjacency (bbox touches output bars from #1). Unknown: Exact left/right assignment (varies by input position, not predictable without more).

#### 3. **Blue Scattered Blocks → Central Connectors (Adjacency → Combined Structure)**
   - **Components Involved**: Multiple Blue shapes in input (mixed holes=0/1, scattered bboxes, total pixels ~10-20; Train 1: [6,7,9,9] pixels=7 holes=0 + [21,12,22,14] pixels=5 holes=0; Train 2: [11,1,16,5] pixels=18 holes=1 + [1,3,3,5] pixels=8 holes=1 + [5,15,7,17] pixels=8 holes=1).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Scattered Blues consistently merge or reposition into 1-2 connected blocks in output, forming horizontal/vertical shafts in the central motif, often with holes=1 and increased pixels per block via apparent combination.
     - Train 1 Output: [1,1,5,3] pixels=10 holes=1 (left-central connector).
     - Train 2 Output: [0,1,2,3] pixels=8 holes=1 (left connector) + [16,0,21,4] pixels=18 holes=1 (right connector).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input positions (scattered, non-adjacent bboxes) effect output adjacency (blocks now touch or overlap in central area); hole property sometimes preserved/amplified (≥1 hole in output if any input Blue had holes). Interacts with Red/Green by direct bbox adjacency in output.
   - **Consistency**: Scattering-to-connection pattern exact in both; always central. Unknown: How scattered pixels combine exactly (e.g., Train 1 total input ~12 → 10 output; no clear hole addition rule).

#### 4. **Red Bars/Accents → Central H/Cross Motif (Position → Adjacency with Blue/Green)**
   - **Components Involved**: Red shapes in input (holes=0, bar-like or small; Train 1: [10,7,12,9] pixels=7 + small [14,8,14,8] pixels=1 + [4,19,4,19] pixels=1; Train 2: [2,4,2,4] pixels=1 + [6,16,6,16] pixels=1 + [15,2,16,4] pixels=5).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Input Reds (often horizontal or vertical bars) consistently reposition to form the central connecting element (H or cross-like), with small accents embedding into or adjacent to Blue/Green structures.
     - Train 1 Output: [6,1,8,3] pixels=7 (central bar) + [10,2,10,2] pixels=1 (embedded accent).
     - Train 2 Output: [1,2,1,2] pixels=1 (central small) + implied in structure (no large Red bar, but accents tie to Green).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input bottom/middle positions (y-mid to high) effect output central position (low y, mid x); interacts with Blue (#3) and Green (#5) via bbox overlap or touching (e.g., Red between Blue and Green in both outputs). Pixels often preserved for main bar (~7).
   - **Consistency**: Central motif role and adjacency to Blue/Green in both; holes=0 preserved. Unknown: Embedding rule for small Reds (position-based? not fully consistent without visuals).

#### 5. **Green Bars with Holes=1 → Right-Side Extension (Adjacency with Red/Blue)**
   - **Components Involved**: Green shapes with holes=1 and ~8 pixels in input (Train 1: [13,7,15,9] pixels=8 + [3,18,5,20] pixels=8; Train 2 lacks exact holes=1 but has equivalent [8,16,15,16] pixels=8 holes=0—partial match, but pattern holds via output).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These Green bars consistently extend to the right side of the central structure in output, often horizontal, with holes=1 where input had them, adjoining Red/Blue.
     - Train 1 Output: [9,1,11,3] pixels=8 holes=1 (right of Red).
     - Train 2 Output: [3,2,10,2] pixels=8 holes=0 (right extension, adjacent to Red/Blue) + small Greens [19,1,20,1] pixels=2 and [19,3,20,3] pixels=2 (right accents).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input right/middle positions effect output right placement; hole count (1 where present) preserved or applied; pixels ~8 for main bar. Direct interaction: Touches Red (#4) bbox on left in both outputs.
   - **Consistency**: Right-extension and Red adjacency in both, though Train 2 holes=0 (slight property variance, but transformation consistent). Unknown: Hole application in Train 2 (input 0 → output 0, but pattern ties to bar role).

#### 6. **Yellow Small Squares → Embedded Accents in Blue/Maroon (Position → Integration)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small Yellow shapes (holes=0, pixels=1-2, dot-like) in input (Train 1: [6,8,6,8] pixels=1; Train 2: [11,3,12,3] pixels=2 + [14,3,15,3] pixels=2).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These consistently embed as small accents within or adjacent to Blue or base layers (Maroon/Yellow from #1) in output, preserving small size.
     - Train 1 Output: [2,2,2,2] pixels=1 (embedded in Blue area).
     - Train 2 Output: [16,2,17,2] pixels=2 + [19,2,20,2] pixels=2 (in right Blue/Yellow).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input bottom-left/mid positions effect output central/right embedding; interacts with Blue (#3) via bbox inclusion (Yellow inside Blue bbox in both).
   - **Consistency**: Embedding into Blue/base in both; no holes. Unknown: Exact integration depth (pixels unchanged, but no overlap math explainable).

#### General Consistent Properties Across All Interactions
- **Color Preservation**: All listed interactions keep input color unchanged in output (e.g., no color shifts like position → color).
- **Hole Effects on Connection**: Shapes with holes=1 in input (e.g., Green, some Blue) consistently end up with holes=1 in output and enable "holding" or adjacency (e.g., Red/Yellow embed near them); holes=0 stay 0 and form solid bars/frames.
- **Position → Centralization**: Scattered/marginal input positions (e.g., edges, bottom) consistently transform to centralized or framed output positions, implying a gathering effect.
- **Adjacency as Core Interaction**: All central components (Blue, Red, Green) interact via bbox touching/overlaps in output, forming a linear or H-like chain (Blue-Red-Green) in both trains.
- **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Elements Noted**: Small isolated dots (e.g., some Reds/Yellows without bar ties) or colors like Light Blue (absent in Train 2 output) show no cross-example interactions. No consistent hole count → color effects. No clear silhouette/edge-based movement (bboxes alone don't reveal). Purple mentioned in initial description absent in data, so ignored.

No other obvious, consistent interactions identifiable without forcing (e.g., no reliable pixel total conservation or full shape semantics).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 13:59:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core component extraction via DFS (helpful, as it correctly identifies connected non-bg regions)
def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform bg color from top-left
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(comp) >= 10:
                    components.append(comp)
    return components
```

```python
# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on unique non-bg values (<=3 incl. 4 or single 8); over-specific to numbers, causes incorrect trimming in train2 (e.g., removes parts of main object).
    # Broken/not general: Fails when patterns don't match exact conditions, leading to asymmetric or incomplete shapes.
    # Do not reuse without generalization.
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Properties

Based on the provided data from both training examples (inputs and outputs), I analyzed components for interactions or effects that are obvious, direct, and present in **every** case (Train 1 and Train 2). Interactions are limited to those with clear, repeatable patterns across positions, properties (e.g., holes, pixels, bbox adjacency or overlap implications), colors, or transformations. Only elements appearing in all inputs and outputs are considered (e.g., excluding Orange, Light Blue, Dark Red as they are absent in at least one full train pair). No high-level puzzle solving or irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., singleton small dots without cross-example ties) are included. Unknowns are noted where a property or transformation cannot be clearly linked without forcing.

#### 1. **Large Multi-Hole Shape → Horizontal Layered Bars (Color-Preserving Split)**
   - **Components Involved**: The dominant large shape (high pixels, multiple holes) in input (Maroon in Train 1, pixels=527, holes=3, bbox covering most canvas [0,0,24,22]; Yellow in Train 2, pixels=513, holes=4, bbox [0,0,19,29]).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: This shape's multi-hole property (holes ≥3) consistently transforms into multiple horizontal bars of the **same color** in output, forming layered base structures. Bars have reduced pixels per instance but maintain horizontal orientation (wide bbox in x, narrow in y).
     - Train 1 Output: Maroon bars ([3,0,11,1] pixels=12; [3,3,11,4] pixels=12), positioned as base layers.
     - Train 2 Output: Yellow bars ([0,0,10,1] pixels=18; [0,3,10,4] pixels=18; [14,0,17,0] pixels=4; [14,4,17,4] pixels=4), positioned as extended base layers.
   - **Properties Linking**: Hole count (multi-hole input) effects the multiplicity of output bars (≥2 bars); color preserved directly (Maroon → Maroon bars; Yellow → Yellow bars). Position effect: Input's full-canvas bbox implies output bars span horizontally across central/lower areas.
   - **Consistency**: Exact in both trains; no exceptions. Unknown: Exact pixel redistribution mechanism (total output pixels << input, possible cropping or overlap not explainable from data).

#### 2. **Pink Vertical/Hook → Side Framing Bars (Position → Position Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Pink shape in input (holes=0, vertical or L-ish bbox; Train 1: [20,11,20,15] pixels=5; Train 2: [3,23,6,27] pixels=12).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Pink's near-vertical bbox (tall y-span relative to x) consistently moves to frame the sides of the central output structure, preserving pixels and holes=0, but adjusting to stricter vertical alignment.
     - Train 1 Output: [0,0,0,4] pixels=5 (left frame).
     - Train 2 Output: [11,0,14,4] pixels=12 (right/middle frame).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input position (top-right or bottom in bbox) effects output position (shifts to left/right edges of canvas); shape property (hook/L to straight vertical bar). No color change.
   - **Consistency**: Present and transformed similarly in both; interacts with central structure by adjacency (bbox touches output bars from #1). Unknown: Exact left/right assignment (varies by input position, not predictable without more).

#### 3. **Blue Scattered Blocks → Central Connectors (Adjacency → Combined Structure)**
   - **Components Involved**: Multiple Blue shapes in input (mixed holes=0/1, scattered bboxes, total pixels ~10-20; Train 1: [6,7,9,9] pixels=7 holes=0 + [21,12,22,14] pixels=5 holes=0; Train 2: [11,1,16,5] pixels=18 holes=1 + [1,3,3,5] pixels=8 holes=1 + [5,15,7,17] pixels=8 holes=1).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Scattered Blues consistently merge or reposition into 1-2 connected blocks in output, forming horizontal/vertical shafts in the central motif, often with holes=1 and increased pixels per block via apparent combination.
     - Train 1 Output: [1,1,5,3] pixels=10 holes=1 (left-central connector).
     - Train 2 Output: [0,1,2,3] pixels=8 holes=1 (left connector) + [16,0,21,4] pixels=18 holes=1 (right connector).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input positions (scattered, non-adjacent bboxes) effect output adjacency (blocks now touch or overlap in central area); hole property sometimes preserved/amplified (≥1 hole in output if any input Blue had holes). Interacts with Red/Green by direct bbox adjacency in output.
   - **Consistency**: Scattering-to-connection pattern exact in both; always central. Unknown: How scattered pixels combine exactly (e.g., Train 1 total input ~12 → 10 output; no clear hole addition rule).

#### 4. **Red Bars/Accents → Central H/Cross Motif (Position → Adjacency with Blue/Green)**
   - **Components Involved**: Red shapes in input (holes=0, bar-like or small; Train 1: [10,7,12,9] pixels=7 + small [14,8,14,8] pixels=1 + [4,19,4,19] pixels=1; Train 2: [2,4,2,4] pixels=1 + [6,16,6,16] pixels=1 + [15,2,16,4] pixels=5).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Input Reds (often horizontal or vertical bars) consistently reposition to form the central connecting element (H or cross-like), with small accents embedding into or adjacent to Blue/Green structures.
     - Train 1 Output: [6,1,8,3] pixels=7 (central bar) + [10,2,10,2] pixels=1 (embedded accent).
     - Train 2 Output: [1,2,1,2] pixels=1 (central small) + implied in structure (no large Red bar, but accents tie to Green).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input bottom/middle positions (y-mid to high) effect output central position (low y, mid x); interacts with Blue (#3) and Green (#5) via bbox overlap or touching (e.g., Red between Blue and Green in both outputs). Pixels often preserved for main bar (~7).
   - **Consistency**: Central motif role and adjacency to Blue/Green in both; holes=0 preserved. Unknown: Embedding rule for small Reds (position-based? not fully consistent without visuals).

#### 5. **Green Bars with Holes=1 → Right-Side Extension (Adjacency with Red/Blue)**
   - **Components Involved**: Green shapes with holes=1 and ~8 pixels in input (Train 1: [13,7,15,9] pixels=8 + [3,18,5,20] pixels=8; Train 2 lacks exact holes=1 but has equivalent [8,16,15,16] pixels=8 holes=0—partial match, but pattern holds via output).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These Green bars consistently extend to the right side of the central structure in output, often horizontal, with holes=1 where input had them, adjoining Red/Blue.
     - Train 1 Output: [9,1,11,3] pixels=8 holes=1 (right of Red).
     - Train 2 Output: [3,2,10,2] pixels=8 holes=0 (right extension, adjacent to Red/Blue) + small Greens [19,1,20,1] pixels=2 and [19,3,20,3] pixels=2 (right accents).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input right/middle positions effect output right placement; hole count (1 where present) preserved or applied; pixels ~8 for main bar. Direct interaction: Touches Red (#4) bbox on left in both outputs.
   - **Consistency**: Right-extension and Red adjacency in both, though Train 2 holes=0 (slight property variance, but transformation consistent). Unknown: Hole application in Train 2 (input 0 → output 0, but pattern ties to bar role).

#### 6. **Yellow Small Squares → Embedded Accents in Blue/Maroon (Position → Integration)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small Yellow shapes (holes=0, pixels=1-2, dot-like) in input (Train 1: [6,8,6,8] pixels=1; Train 2: [11,3,12,3] pixels=2 + [14,3,15,3] pixels=2).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: These consistently embed as small accents within or adjacent to Blue or base layers (Maroon/Yellow from #1) in output, preserving small size.
     - Train 1 Output: [2,2,2,2] pixels=1 (embedded in Blue area).
     - Train 2 Output: [16,2,17,2] pixels=2 + [19,2,20,2] pixels=2 (in right Blue/Yellow).
   - **Properties Linking**: Input bottom-left/mid positions effect output central/right embedding; interacts with Blue (#3) via bbox inclusion (Yellow inside Blue bbox in both).
   - **Consistency**: Embedding into Blue/base in both; no holes. Unknown: Exact integration depth (pixels unchanged, but no overlap math explainable).

#### General Consistent Properties Across All Interactions
- **Color Preservation**: All listed interactions keep input color unchanged in output (e.g., no color shifts like position → color).
- **Hole Effects on Connection**: Shapes with holes=1 in input (e.g., Green, some Blue) consistently end up with holes=1 in output and enable "holding" or adjacency (e.g., Red/Yellow embed near them); holes=0 stay 0 and form solid bars/frames.
- **Position → Centralization**: Scattered/marginal input positions (e.g., edges, bottom) consistently transform to centralized or framed output positions, implying a gathering effect.
- **Adjacency as Core Interaction**: All central components (Blue, Red, Green) interact via bbox touching/overlaps in output, forming a linear or H-like chain (Blue-Red-Green) in both trains.
- **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Elements Noted**: Small isolated dots (e.g., some Reds/Yellows without bar ties) or colors like Light Blue (absent in Train 2 output) show no cross-example interactions. No consistent hole count → color effects. No clear silhouette/edge-based movement (bboxes alone don't reveal). Purple mentioned in initial description absent in data, so ignored.

No other obvious, consistent interactions identifiable without forcing (e.g., no reliable pixel total conservation or full shape semantics).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:09:08] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large connected components of non-background cells (objects or blobs), extracting minimal bounding subgrids for each, trimming extraneous background and protrusion columns based on specific rules, padding them to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenating these subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output, sorted by the topmost row position of each component (descending order to prioritize higher components).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all components must exclude bg cells and only consider 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Only include components with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are omitted entirely.
 * After bounding box extraction, trim outer pure-bg columns from left/right, but do not trim rows (vertical trimming is not applied).
 * Trim "protrusions" iteratively from left/right: remove a column if its non-bg cells have <=2 unique values including 4 or 5, or exactly 1 unique value of 8 (this seems to target thin, simple extensions like lines or bars, but may over-trim complex shapes).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the subgrid if shorter or truncating from center if longer (though truncation is rare given component sizes).
 * Sort components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then concatenate their 5-row subgrids side-by-side into the output; no vertical stacking or other arrangements.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with varying column lengths per row only if subgrids have different widths, but in practice, they should align as a flat concatenation.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are value-specific (e.g., 4/5/8 trigger removal), suggesting the grid uses numbered cells representing colors/shapes, and protrusions are often uniform or low-variety "noise" like borders or antennas.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are separated by bg; bounding boxes may include internal bg holes, which are preserved (no infilling).
 * Easy to miss: Sorting is by -minr (top-first), not by left position or size; if multiple top-aligned, order is unstable (as-is from discovery).
 * Empty input or no large components should return 5 empty rows.
 * Potential over-trimming: The protrusion rule may remove valid parts of objects if they match the criteria (e.g., a column with only 4's and 5's gets trimmed even if integral to the shape).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; it correctly identifies large components and extracts/concatenates them, but fails on trimming and arrangement.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 9's in top/bottom rows (e.g., [6,8,9,9,8,...] vs expected [6,8,9,8,8,...] with single 9), and inner structure mismatches (e.g., row2 has 4,4 vs expected 4,1; overall shape bloated on left with duplicated 1's and 8's), likely due to over-retention of bg or protrusion columns; right side (2's/3's) is close but shifted.
 * Train 1: Sorting by -minr works in concept, but concatenation includes untrimmed parts, leading to wider-than-expected output (13 cols vs expected 12).
 * Train 2: Generated a symmetric but incorrect layout with 6's on left/top and duplicated patterns (e.g., row0 starts [6,6,6,4,...] vs expected [4,4,4,...] with 6's later); right side has 1's/3's mismatched (e.g., row1 ends [...,3,3,1] vs expected [...,3,3,1] but overall order wrong, with 20+ cols vs expected 22); suggests wrong component discovery or trimming removed too much/too little, flipping left/right elements.
 * Train 2: Protrusion trimming likely failed to remove intended bars (e.g., 6's or 8's), causing misaligned concatenation; expected has longer, more spread-out components including 8's not in generated.
 * Over-trimming in protrusions: Rule catches simple columns (e.g., all 8's or 4/5 mixes) but may spare complex ones incorrectly, or vice versa; in train1, it didn't trim enough to remove extra 9's.
 * find_large_components is helpful and likely correct (size threshold and connectivity match needs), but may include bg-adjacent noise if threshold too low.
 * trim_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Its criteria (ls<=2 with 4/5, or single 8) are too narrow/specific, missing other protrusion types (e.g., 6's, 9's, or 1/2/3 mixes in examples); it under-trims in train1 (extra 9's) and over-trims or misapplies in train2 (wrong symmetry); do not use without generalization (e.g., expand to more values or count non-bg density).
 * get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows are helpful and seem correct, preserving shapes and standardizing height.
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but insufficient alone; needs better protrusion handling.
 * Overall program: Concatenation logic is close (horizontal, top-sorted), but fails due to upstream trimming errors; empty handling is good.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 5-row grid with inconsistent widths (row0: 26 elements, row1: 26, row2: 26, row3: 26, row4: 26, but visually misaligned in listing), featuring clustered numbers like multiple 3's/8's on left/middle and 1's/6's/7's/9's scattered, suggesting multiple components were found and concatenated but poorly trimmed (e.g., excess 8's as bg intrusions, untrimmed protrusions like vertical 3's or 6's).
 * Compared to training failures, it inherits issues: Likely over-retention of bg/protrusions (e.g., lines of 8's or 3's that should be trimmed), wrong sorting (components appear jumbled, not strictly top-first), and value mismatches (7's and 9's prominent, possibly untrimmed edges like in train1).
 * Does not make sense as a clean puzzle solution: Output has dense, asymmetric blobs (e.g., row4 ends with 1,1,1,3,3,3 but starts with 3,8,8,...), lacking the structured symmetry or separation seen in expected training outputs; probably includes small/noisy components or fails to isolate core shapes (e.g., the 7's might be protrusions not caught by trim rules).
 * To handle test: Need broader trimming (e.g., remove columns with <50% non-bg or specific patterns beyond 4/5/8), verify component count/order against expected (test seems to have 3-4 objects based on shifts at cols ~6,12,20), and ensure no internal bg inflation.

[2025-10-01 14:09:19] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided data across all examples (train inputs/outputs and test inputs), I identified only obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements that appear consistently in **every** puzzle instance. These are limited to cases where one element's properties (e.g., position, size, color, or pixel count) clearly overlap or contain another within bounding boxes, affecting shared properties like holes or structure. I ignored isolated elements (e.g., standalone small squares with no bbox overlap), high-level arrangements (e.g., overall horizontal structuring), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., specific color pairs like Red-Green, which do not appear in every example). No forced connections or semantic meanings were assumed beyond the data. Transformations (e.g., how inputs rearrange to outputs) are noted as unknown where not directly observable in consistent interactions.

#### 1. **Embedding of Small Blocks into Larger Blocks (Consistent Across All Examples)**
   - **Description**: A small block (typically 1-2 pixels, holes=0, single-color, small bbox like [x,x+0/1,y,y] or [x,x+1,y,y]) has its bbox fully contained within the bbox of a larger block (5-18 pixels, often holes=1, multi-unit bbox spanning 2-5 units in width/height). This creates a direct positional interaction, where the small block occupies space inside the larger one's silhouette, reducing the larger's effective empty space (evident from pixel counts < bbox area) and sometimes contributing to or interacting with the larger's hole property.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - **Position → Structure**: The small block's relative position (e.g., center or edge within the larger bbox) consistently affects the larger block's overall shape properties (e.g., holes or silhouette edges). For example, a 1-pixel small block inside a larger block with holes=1 appears to "fill" or define part of the hole, but the exact effect on movement/transformation is unknown.
     - **Pixel Count → Hole Count**: The larger block's pixel count is less than its bbox area due to the small block's placement, correlating with holes=1 in most cases (e.g., larger block pixels + small block pixels ≈ bbox area minus hole space). This is consistent but does not always result in holes>0 (some larger blocks have holes=0 despite embedding).
     - **Color Interaction**: The small block's color (e.g., Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Dark Red) does not change the larger block's color but may influence composite identity (e.g., Red small in Blue larger vs. Yellow small in Blue larger), though specific effects on transformation are unknown.
   - **Examples of Consistent Instances**:
     - Train Input 1: Red (1 pixel, [14,8,14,8]) embedded in Green (8 pixels, holes=1, [13,7,15,9]); another Red (1 pixel, [4,19,4,19]) embedded in Green (8 pixels, holes=1, [3,18,5,20]).
     - Train Input 2: Red (1 pixel, [2,4,2,4]) embedded in Blue (8 pixels, holes=1, [1,3,3,5]); Yellow (2 pixels, [11,3,12,3] and [14,3,15,3]) embedded in Blue (18 pixels, holes=1, [11,1,16,5]).
     - Test Input 1: Green (2 pixels, [5,2,6,2]) embedded in Blue (9 pixels, holes=0, [4,1,7,3]); Dark Red (1 pixel, [8,3,8,3]) embedded in Maroon (7 pixels, holes=0, [7,2,9,4]); Blue (1 pixel, [5,21,5,21]) embedded in Yellow (10 pixels, holes=1, [3,20,7,22]).
     - Test Input 2: Yellow (1 pixel, [8,2,8,2]) embedded in Red (8 pixels, holes=1, [7,1,9,3]); another Yellow (1 pixel, [2,6,2,6]) embedded in Red (8 pixels, holes=1, [1,5,3,7]); Dark Red (1 pixel, [10,8,10,8]) embedded in Yellow (8 pixels, holes=1, [9,7,11,9]); Dark Red (1 pixel, [5,16,5,16]) embedded in Yellow (8 pixels, holes=1, [4,15,6,17]).
   - **Consistency Note**: This embedding occurs in every example (at least 1-4 instances per input), forming composite units. Relative positions are preserved in train outputs (e.g., center-embedded Red stays center in Green/Blue), but exact transformation rules (e.g., why some composites move left-to-right) are unknown.
   - **Non-Interacting Elements**: Standalone small blocks (e.g., isolated Light Blue 1-pixel with no containing bbox) or larger blocks without embeddings (e.g., some Pink verticals) show no such interaction.

#### 2. **Large Canvas Block Encompassing Scattered Components (Consistent Across All Examples)**
   - **Description**: A single large block (300-500+ pixels, holes=3-6, full-canvas bbox like [0,0,19-24,19-29]) contains the bboxes of all smaller components (embedded pairs and standalones) within its overall area. This creates a global positional interaction, where the canvas's holes (multiple enclosed areas) potentially interact with the scattered positions of smaller elements.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - **Position → Canvas Holes**: Scattered positions of small/larger blocks fall within or near the canvas's hole areas (inferred from pixel deficits in canvas: e.g., train1 Maroon 527 pixels vs. ~575 area, deficit ~48 linked to 3 holes). The canvas's hole count correlates with the number of embedded composites or standalones, suggesting the holes "contain" or are affected by component placements, but specific effects (e.g., filling) are unknown.
     - **Color → Overall Structure**: The canvas's color (Maroon, Yellow, Green, Blue) differs from the green background but encompasses all other colors, indicating a containing interaction that affects the scattered arrangement. No color change observed, but it unifies components into a single silhouette.
     - **Pixel Count → Enclosure**: Canvas pixels are the sum of all other components' pixels plus background fill, with holes representing unfilled spaces interacted with by small components.
   - **Examples of Consistent Instances**:
     - Train Input 1: Maroon (527 pixels, holes=3, [0,0,24,22]) encompasses all small/embedded components (e.g., Greens, Blues, Reds).
     - Train Input 2: Yellow (513 pixels, holes=4, [0,0,19,29]) encompasses all (e.g., Blues, Reds, Yellows, Oranges, Greens).
     - Test Input 1: Green (415 pixels, holes=6, [0,0,19,25]) encompasses all (e.g., Blues, Maroons, Yellows, Reds, Darks).
     - Test Input 2: Blue (306 pixels, holes=4, [0,0,19,19]) encompasses all (e.g., Reds, Yellows, Maroons, Greens, Pinks, Darks).
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in every input as the sole large element, interacting positionally with all others via enclosure. In train outputs, the canvas is absent (replaced by structured small components), so transformation effect is unknown.
   - **Non-Interacting Elements**: The green background fills the entire canvas but shows no direct property interaction (e.g., no color/position change) with components; it is irrelevant to specific connections.

#### Unknowns and Limitations
- **Color-to-Color Effects**: While colors interact via embedding (e.g., small Red in larger Green), no consistent rule for how one color "affects" another's transformation (e.g., position shift or hole creation) is observable across all; specific pairings vary and cannot be explained without forcing patterns.
- **Hole-to-Movement Effects**: Embeddings consistently link to holes=1 in larger blocks, but how this affects movement (e.g., why some composites appear in output with preserved holes) is unknown.
- **Irrelevant Elements**: Elements like isolated Orange/Green 1-2 pixel lines (e.g., train2 [14,2,15,2]) or Pink without embeddings show no consistent interactions (no bbox containment or hole links in every example) and were excluded.
- No other obvious consistent interactions (e.g., edge adjacency without bbox overlap, or position-to-color changes) appear in every puzzle; scattered arrangements prevent non-enclosure connections in inputs.

This list is exhaustive based on direct, data-driven observations only.

[2025-10-01 14:11:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core component extraction via DFS (helpful, as it correctly identifies connected non-bg regions)
def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform bg color from top-left
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(comp) >= 10:
                    components.append(comp)
    return components
```

```python
# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS (stack-based) to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size.
    # Helpful for isolating objects; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
    # Directions: up/down/left/right only.
    # Returns list of position lists, filtered by size.
    if not g or not g[0]:

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large connected components of non-background cells (objects or blobs), extracting minimal bounding subgrids for each, trimming extraneous background and protrusion columns based on specific rules, padding them to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenating these subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output, sorted by the topmost row position of each component (descending order to prioritize higher components).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all components must exclude bg cells and only consider 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Only include components with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are omitted entirely.
 * After bounding box extraction, trim outer pure-bg columns from left/right, but do not trim rows (vertical trimming is not applied).
 * Trim "protrusions" iteratively from left/right: remove a column if its non-bg cells have <=2 unique values including 4 or 5, or exactly 1 unique value of 8 (this seems to target thin, simple extensions like lines or bars, but may over-trim complex shapes).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the subgrid if shorter or truncating from center if longer (though truncation is rare given component sizes).
 * Sort components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then concatenate their 5-row subgrids side-by-side into the output; no vertical stacking or other arrangements.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with varying column lengths per row only if subgrids have different widths, but in practice, they should align as a flat concatenation.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are value-specific (e.g., 4/5/8 trigger removal), suggesting the grid uses numbered cells representing colors/shapes, and protrusions are often uniform or low-variety "noise" like borders or antennas.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are separated by bg; bounding boxes may include internal bg holes, which are preserved (no infilling).
 * Easy to miss: Sorting is by -minr (top-first), not by left position or size; if multiple top-aligned, order is unstable (as-is from discovery).
 * Empty input or no large components should return 5 empty rows.
 * Potential over-trimming: The protrusion rule may remove valid parts of objects if they match the criteria (e.g., a column with only 4's and 5's gets trimmed even if integral to the shape).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; it correctly identifies large components and extracts/concatenates them, but fails on trimming and arrangement.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 9's in top/bottom rows (e.g., [6,8,9,9,8,...] vs expected [6,8,9,8,8,...] with single 9), and inner structure mismatches (e.g., row2 has 4,4 vs expected 4,1; overall shape bloated on left with duplicated 1's and 8's), likely due to over-retention of bg or protrusion columns; right side (2's/3's) is close but shifted.
 * Train 1: Sorting by -minr works in concept, but concatenation includes untrimmed parts, leading to wider-than-expected output (13 cols vs expected 12).
 * Train 2: Generated a symmetric but incorrect layout with 6's on left/top and duplicated patterns (e.g., row0 starts [6,6,6,4,...] vs expected [4,4,4,...] with 6's later); right side has 1's/3's mismatched (e.g., row1 ends [...,3,3,1] vs expected [...,3,3,1] but overall order wrong, with 20+ cols vs expected 22); suggests wrong component discovery or trimming removed too much/too little, flipping left/right elements.
 * Train 2: Protrusion trimming likely failed to remove intended bars (e.g., 6's or 8's), causing misaligned concatenation; expected has longer, more spread-out components including 8's not in generated.
 * Over-trimming in protrusions: Rule catches simple columns (e.g., all 8's or 4/5 mixes) but may spare complex ones incorrectly, or vice versa; in train1, it didn't trim enough to remove extra 9's.
 * find_large_components is helpful and likely correct (size threshold and connectivity match needs), but may include bg-adjacent noise if threshold too low.
 * trim_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Its criteria (ls<=2 with 4/5, or single 8) are too narrow/specific, missing other protrusion types (e.g., 6's, 9's, or 1/2/3 mixes in examples); it under-trims in train1 (extra 9's) and over-trims or misapplies in train2 (wrong symmetry); do not use without generalization (e.g., expand to more values or count non-bg density).
 * get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows are helpful and seem correct, preserving shapes and standardizing height.
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but insufficient alone; needs better protrusion handling.
 * Overall program: Concatenation logic is close (horizontal, top-sorted), but fails due to upstream trimming errors; empty handling is good.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 5-row grid with inconsistent widths (row0: 26 elements, row1: 26, row2: 26, row3: 26, row4: 26, but visually misaligned in listing), featuring clustered numbers like multiple 3's/8's on left/middle and 1's/6's/7's/9's scattered, suggesting multiple components were found and concatenated but poorly trimmed (e.g., excess 8's as bg intrusions, untrimmed protrusions like vertical 3's or 6's).
 * Compared to training failures, it inherits issues: Likely over-retention of bg/protrusions (e.g., lines of 8's or 3's that should be trimmed), wrong sorting (components appear jumbled, not strictly top-first), and value mismatches (7's and 9's prominent, possibly untrimmed edges like in train1).
 * Does not make sense as a clean puzzle solution: Output has dense, asymmetric blobs (e.g., row4 ends with 1,1,1,3,3,3 but starts with 3,8,8,...), lacking the structured symmetry or separation seen in expected training outputs; probably includes small/noisy components or fails to isolate core shapes (e.g., the 7's might be protrusions not caught by trim rules).
 * To handle test: Need broader trimming (e.g., remove columns with <50% non-bg or specific patterns beyond 4/5/8), verify component count/order against expected (test seems to have 3-4 objects based on shifts at cols ~6,12,20), and ensure no internal bg inflation.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

    # Do not reuse without generalization.

def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided data across all examples (train inputs/outputs and test inputs), I identified only obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements that appear consistently in **every** puzzle instance. These are limited to cases where one element's properties (e.g., position, size, color, or pixel count) clearly overlap or contain another within bounding boxes, affecting shared properties like holes or structure. I ignored isolated elements (e.g., standalone small squares with no bbox overlap), high-level arrangements (e.g., overall horizontal structuring), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., specific color pairs like Red-Green, which do not appear in every example). No forced connections or semantic meanings were assumed beyond the data. Transformations (e.g., how inputs rearrange to outputs) are noted as unknown where not directly observable in consistent interactions.

#### 1. **Embedding of Small Blocks into Larger Blocks (Consistent Across All Examples)**
   - **Description**: A small block (typically 1-2 pixels, holes=0, single-color, small bbox like [x,x+0/1,y,y] or [x,x+1,y,y]) has its bbox fully contained within the bbox of a larger block (5-18 pixels, often holes=1, multi-unit bbox spanning 2-5 units in width/height). This creates a direct positional interaction, where the small block occupies space inside the larger one's silhouette, reducing the larger's effective empty space (evident from pixel counts < bbox area) and sometimes contributing to or interacting with the larger's hole property.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - **Position → Structure**: The small block's relative position (e.g., center or edge within the larger bbox) consistently affects the larger block's overall shape properties (e.g., holes or silhouette edges). For example, a 1-pixel small block inside a larger block with holes=1 appears to "fill" or define part of the hole, but the exact effect on movement/transformation is unknown.
     - **Pixel Count → Hole Count**: The larger block's pixel count is less than its bbox area due to the small block's placement, correlating with holes=1 in most cases (e.g., larger block pixels + small block pixels ≈ bbox area minus hole space). This is consistent but does not always result in holes>0 (some larger blocks have holes=0 despite embedding).
     - **Color Interaction**: The small block's color (e.g., Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Dark Red) does not change the larger block's color but may influence composite identity (e.g., Red small in Blue larger vs. Yellow small in Blue larger), though specific effects on transformation are unknown.
   - **Examples of Consistent Instances**:
     - Train Input 1: Red (1 pixel, [14,8,14,8]) embedded in Green (8 pixels, holes=1, [13,7,15,9]); another Red (1 pixel, [4,19,4,19]) embedded in Green (8 pixels, holes=1, [3,18,5,20]).
     - Train Input 2: Red (1 pixel, [2,4,2,4]) embedded in Blue (8 pixels, holes=1, [1,3,3,5]); Yellow (2 pixels, [11,3,12,3] and [14,3,15,3]) embedded in Blue (18 pixels, holes=1, [11,1,16,5]).
     - Test Input 1: Green (2 pixels, [5,2,6,2]) embedded in Blue (9 pixels, holes=0, [4,1,7,3]); Dark Red (1 pixel, [8,3,8,3]) embedded in Maroon (7 pixels, holes=0, [7,2,9,4]); Blue (1 pixel, [5,21,5,21]) embedded in Yellow (10 pixels, holes=1, [3,20,7,22]).
     - Test Input 2: Yellow (1 pixel, [8,2,8,2]) embedded in Red (8 pixels, holes=1, [7,1,9,3]); another Yellow (1 pixel, [2,6,2,6]) embedded in Red (8 pixels, holes=1, [1,5,3,7]); Dark Red (1 pixel, [10,8,10,8]) embedded in Yellow (8 pixels, holes=1, [9,7,11,9]); Dark Red (1 pixel, [5,16,5,16]) embedded in Yellow (8 pixels, holes=1, [4,15,6,17]).
   - **Consistency Note**: This embedding occurs in every example (at least 1-4 instances per input), forming composite units. Relative positions are preserved in train outputs (e.g., center-embedded Red stays center in Green/Blue), but exact transformation rules (e.g., why some composites move left-to-right) are unknown.
   - **Non-Interacting Elements**: Standalone small blocks (e.g., isolated Light Blue 1-pixel with no containing bbox) or larger blocks without embeddings (e.g., some Pink verticals) show no such interaction.

#### 2. **Large Canvas Block Encompassing Scattered Components (Consistent Across All Examples)**
   - **Description**: A single large block (300-500+ pixels, holes=3-6, full-canvas bbox like [0,0,19-24,19-29]) contains the bboxes of all smaller components (embedded pairs and standalones) within its overall area. This creates a global positional interaction, where the canvas's holes (multiple enclosed areas) potentially interact with the scattered positions of smaller elements.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - **Position → Canvas Holes**: Scattered positions of small/larger blocks fall within or near the canvas's hole areas (inferred from pixel deficits in canvas: e.g., train1 Maroon 527 pixels vs. ~575 area, deficit ~48 linked to 3 holes). The canvas's hole count correlates with the number of embedded composites or standalones, suggesting the holes "contain" or are affected by component placements, but specific effects (e.g., filling) are unknown.
     - **Color → Overall Structure**: The canvas's color (Maroon, Yellow, Green, Blue) differs from the green background but encompasses all other colors, indicating a containing interaction that affects the scattered arrangement. No color change observed, but it unifies components into a single silhouette.
     - **Pixel Count → Enclosure**: Canvas pixels are the sum of all other components' pixels plus background fill, with holes representing unfilled spaces interacted with by small components.
   - **Examples of Consistent Instances**:
     - Train Input 1: Maroon (527 pixels, holes=3, [0,0,24,22]) encompasses all small/embedded components (e.g., Greens, Blues, Reds).
     - Train Input 2: Yellow (513 pixels, holes=4, [0,0,19,29]) encompasses all (e.g., Blues, Reds, Yellows, Oranges, Greens).
     - Test Input 1: Green (415 pixels, holes=6, [0,0,19,25]) encompasses all (e.g., Blues, Maroons, Yellows, Reds, Darks).
     - Test Input 2: Blue (306 pixels, holes=4, [0,0,19,19]) encompasses all (e.g., Reds, Yellows, Maroons, Greens, Pinks, Darks).
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in every input as the sole large element, interacting positionally with all others via enclosure. In train outputs, the canvas is absent (replaced by structured small components), so transformation effect is unknown.
   - **Non-Interacting Elements**: The green background fills the entire canvas but shows no direct property interaction (e.g., no color/position change) with components; it is irrelevant to specific connections.

#### Unknowns and Limitations
- **Color-to-Color Effects**: While colors interact via embedding (e.g., small Red in larger Green), no consistent rule for how one color "affects" another's transformation (e.g., position shift or hole creation) is observable across all; specific pairings vary and cannot be explained without forcing patterns.
- **Hole-to-Movement Effects**: Embeddings consistently link to holes=1 in larger blocks, but how this affects movement (e.g., why some composites appear in output with preserved holes) is unknown.
- **Irrelevant Elements**: Elements like isolated Orange/Green 1-2 pixel lines (e.g., train2 [14,2,15,2]) or Pink without embeddings show no consistent interactions (no bbox containment or hole links in every example) and were excluded.
- No other obvious consistent interactions (e.g., edge adjacency without bbox overlap, or position-to-color changes) appear in every puzzle; scattered arrangements prevent non-enclosure connections in inputs.

This list is exhaustive based on direct, data-driven observations only.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:24:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Helpful for isolating objects; visited matrix prevents re-processing.
    # Directions: up, down, left, right only (no diagonals).
```
```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid bounding the component cells from the original grid.
    # Preserves original values (including internal bg or holes); essential for shape fidelity.
```
```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns across all rows; returns empty if fully bg.
    # Basic cleanup; works well for outer padding.
```
```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or crops to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering vertically if short, or cropping from top if tall.
    # Handles height normalization; note: width unchanged, assumes sub is non-empty.
```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 14:24:11] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both inputs and outputs) without forcing unsubstantiated links. Only properties like color, holes, position (via bbox overlap), and size (pixels) were considered for potential interactions affecting movement or transformation. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Patterns unique to one train example (e.g., Orange-Green adjacency in train 2 only) or inconsistent (e.g., Red always inside Green) are excluded. Unknown or unexplainable transformations (e.g., exact pixel count changes, rotations, or why Blue gains holes=1 in train 1 output despite input holes=0) are noted as such rather than speculated upon.

1. **Small Yellow shapes interact with Blue shapes via position (bbox containment)**:
   - Small Yellow components (holes=0, pixels=1-2) are consistently positioned within the bounding box of a Blue shape (pixels=5-18, holes=0 or 1).
   - This containment is preserved across movement/transformation to the output assembly.
   - Examples:
     - Train input 1: Yellow (pixels=1, [6,8,6,8]) inside Blue ([6,7,9,9], pixels=7); another Yellow (pixels=1, [22,13,22,13]) inside Blue ([21,12,22,14], pixels=5).
     - Train output 1: Yellow (pixels=1, [2,2,2,2]) inside Blue ([1,1,5,3], pixels=10, holes=1).
     - Train input 2: Two Yellow (pixels=2 each, [11,3,12,3] and [14,3,15,3]) inside Blue ([11,1,16,5], pixels=18, holes=1).
     - Train output 2: Two Yellow (pixels=2 each, [16,2,17,2] and [19,2,20,2]) inside Blue ([16,0,21,4], pixels=18, holes=1).
   - Effect: Position of Yellow affects its movement to stay within Blue's bbox during transformation. (Note: Exact relative position within bbox varies slightly and is unknown why.)

2. **Large multi-hole shape interacts with assembly via color and holes properties (transformation to horizontal segments)**:
   - The single large shape (holes>=3, pixels>500, bbox covering full scene) of color C is consistently transformed into multiple smaller horizontal segments of the same color C (holes=0, pixels=4-18, elongated bboxes with small y-span like [minx, y, maxx, y] or [minx, y, maxx, y+1]).
   - This affects the overall linear structure in outputs, where these segments form extended rows.
   - Examples:
     - Train input 1: Maroon (holes=3, pixels=527, [0,0,24,22]) → Train output 1: Multiple Maroon segments (e.g., pixels=12 [3,0,11,1]; pixels=12 [3,3,11,4]; plus smaller pixels=1).
     - Train input 2: Yellow (holes=4, pixels=513, [0,0,19,29]) → Train output 2: Multiple Yellow segments (e.g., pixels=18 [0,0,10,1]; pixels=18 [0,3,10,4]; pixels=4 [14,0,17,0]; smaller pixels=2).
   - Effect: Color C and high holes count of the large shape effect the creation and positioning of same-color horizontal segments in output. (Note: Exact lengths/pixel counts of segments and why holes drop to 0 are unknown.)

3. **All small shapes interact with the large multi-hole shape via position (global bbox containment)**:
   - All small shapes (pixels<=12, any color except the large shape's color) have bboxes fully contained within the large multi-hole shape's bbox in inputs.
   - This containment is disrupted in outputs (no large shape present), leading to repositioning of small shapes into a compact linear structure.
   - Examples: In both train inputs, all listed small shapes (e.g., Blues, Reds, single pixels) fall within the large Maroon (train 1, [0,0,24,22]) or Yellow (train 2, [0,0,19,29]) bbox. Outputs reposition them without this containment.
   - Effect: Position of the large shape's bbox globally affects positions of all small shapes in inputs; transformation moves small shapes out of containment. (Note: Reason for breaking containment and exact new positions are unknown; no other consistent post-transformation containment exists across both trains.)

No other specific, consistent interactions (e.g., involving Pink, Red singles, or Light Blue) were identifiable across every train input/output without inconsistency or forcing links. For instance, Red single-pixel containment varies by container color (Green in train 1, Blue in train 2), so it is not consistent. Hole count changes for non-large shapes (e.g., Blue gaining holes=1 in train 1) occur but cannot be explained consistently as tied to a single property or interaction.

[2025-10-01 14:27:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core component extraction via DFS (helpful, as it correctly identifies connected non-bg regions)
def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform bg color from top-left
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(comp) >= 10:
                    components.append(comp)
    return components
```

```python
# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large connected components of non-background cells (objects or blobs), extracting minimal bounding subgrids for each, trimming extraneous background and protrusion columns based on specific rules, padding them to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenating these subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output, sorted by the topmost row position of each component (descending order to prioritize higher components).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all components must exclude bg cells and only consider 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Only include components with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are omitted entirely.
 * After bounding box extraction, trim outer pure-bg columns from left/right, but do not trim rows (vertical trimming is not applied).
 * Trim "protrusions" iteratively from left/right: remove a column if its non-bg cells have <=2 unique values including 4 or 5, or exactly 1 unique value of 8 (this seems to target thin, simple extensions like lines or bars, but may over-trim complex shapes).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the subgrid if shorter or truncating from center if longer (though truncation is rare given component sizes).
 * Sort components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then concatenate their 5-row subgrids side-by-side into the output; no vertical stacking or other arrangements.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with varying column lengths per row only if subgrids have different widths, but in practice, they should align as a flat concatenation.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are value-specific (e.g., 4/5/8 trigger removal), suggesting the grid uses numbered cells representing colors/shapes, and protrusions are often uniform or low-variety "noise" like borders or antennas.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are separated by bg; bounding boxes may include internal bg holes, which are preserved (no infilling).
 * Easy to miss: Sorting is by -minr (top-first), not by left position or size; if multiple top-aligned, order is unstable (as-is from discovery).
 * Empty input or no large components should return 5 empty rows.
 * Potential over-trimming: The protrusion rule may remove valid parts of objects if they match the criteria (e.g., a column with only 4's and 5's gets trimmed even if integral to the shape).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; it correctly identifies large components and extracts/concatenates them, but fails on trimming and arrangement.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 9's in top/bottom rows (e.g., [6,8,9,9,8,...] vs expected [6,8,9,8,8,...] with single 9), and inner structure mismatches (e.g., row2 has 4,4 vs expected 4,1; overall shape bloated on left with duplicated 1's and 8's), likely due to over-retention of bg or protrusion columns; right side (2's/3's) is close but shifted.
 * Train 1: Sorting by -minr works in concept, but concatenation includes untrimmed parts, leading to wider-than-expected output (13 cols vs expected 12).
 * Train 2: Generated a symmetric but incorrect layout with 6's on left/top and duplicated patterns (e.g., row0 starts [6,6,6,4,...] vs expected [4,4,4,...] with 6's later); right side has 1's/3's mismatched (e.g., row1 ends [...,3,3,1] vs expected [...,3,3,1] but overall order wrong, with 20+ cols vs expected 22); suggests wrong component discovery or trimming removed too much/too little, flipping left/right elements.
 * Train 2: Protrusion trimming likely failed to remove intended bars (e.g., 6's or 8's), causing misaligned concatenation; expected has longer, more spread-out components including 8's not in generated.
 * Over-trimming in protrusions: Rule catches simple columns (e.g., all 8's or 4/5 mixes) but may spare complex ones incorrectly, or vice versa; in train1, it didn't trim enough to remove extra 9's.
 * find_large_components is helpful and likely correct (size threshold and connectivity match needs), but may include bg-adjacent noise if threshold too low.
 * trim_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Its criteria (ls<=2 with 4/5, or single 8) are too narrow/specific, missing other protrusion types (e.g., 6's, 9's, or 1/2/3 mixes in examples); it under-trims in train1 (extra 9's) and over-trims or misapplies in train2 (wrong symmetry); do not use without generalization (e.g., expand to more values or count non-bg density).
 * get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows are helpful and seem correct, preserving shapes and standardizing height.
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but insufficient alone; needs better protrusion handling.
 * Overall program: Concatenation logic is close (horizontal, top-sorted), but fails due to upstream trimming errors; empty handling is good.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 5-row grid with inconsistent widths (row0: 26 elements, row1: 26, row2: 26, row3: 26, row4: 26, but visually misaligned in listing), featuring clustered numbers like multiple 3's/8's on left/middle and 1's/6's/7's/9's scattered, suggesting multiple components were found and concatenated but poorly trimmed (e.g., excess 8's as bg intrusions, untrimmed protrusions like vertical 3's or 6's).
 * Compared to training failures, it inherits issues: Likely over-retention of bg/protrusions (e.g., lines of 8's or 3's that should be trimmed), wrong sorting (components appear jumbled, not strictly top-first), and value mismatches (7's and 9's prominent, possibly untrimmed edges like in train1).
 * Does not make sense as a clean puzzle solution: Output has dense, asymmetric blobs (e.g., row4 ends with 1,1,1,3,3,3 but starts with 3,8,8,...), lacking the structured symmetry or separation seen in expected training outputs; probably includes small/noisy components or fails to isolate core shapes (e.g., the 7's might be protrusions not caught by trim rules).
 * To handle test: Need broader trimming (e.g., remove columns with <50% non-bg or specific patterns beyond 4/5/8), verify component count/order against expected (test seems to have 3-4 objects based on shifts at cols ~6,12,20), and ensure no internal bg inflation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.

```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both inputs and outputs) without forcing unsubstantiated links. Only properties like color, holes, position (via bbox overlap), and size (pixels) were considered for potential interactions affecting movement or transformation. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Patterns unique to one train example (e.g., Orange-Green adjacency in train 2 only) or inconsistent (e.g., Red always inside Green) are excluded. Unknown or unexplainable transformations (e.g., exact pixel count changes, rotations, or why Blue gains holes=1 in train 1 output despite input holes=0) are noted as such rather than speculated upon.

1. **Small Yellow shapes interact with Blue shapes via position (bbox containment)**:
   - Small Yellow components (holes=0, pixels=1-2) are consistently positioned within the bounding box of a Blue shape (pixels=5-18, holes=0 or 1).
   - This containment is preserved across movement/transformation to the output assembly.
   - Examples:
     - Train input 1: Yellow (pixels=1, [6,8,6,8]) inside Blue ([6,7,9,9], pixels=7); another Yellow (pixels=1, [22,13,22,13]) inside Blue ([21,12,22,14], pixels=5).
     - Train output 1: Yellow (pixels=1, [2,2,2,2]) inside Blue ([1,1,5,3], pixels=10, holes=1).
     - Train input 2: Two Yellow (pixels=2 each, [11,3,12,3] and [14,3,15,3]) inside Blue ([11,1,16,5], pixels=18, holes=1).
     - Train output 2: Two Yellow (pixels=2 each, [16,2,17,2] and [19,2,20,2]) inside Blue ([16,0,21,4], pixels=18, holes=1).
   - Effect: Position of Yellow affects its movement to stay within Blue's bbox during transformation. (Note: Exact relative position within bbox varies slightly and is unknown why.)

2. **Large multi-hole shape interacts with assembly via color and holes properties (transformation to horizontal segments)**:
   - The single large shape (holes>=3, pixels>500, bbox covering full scene) of color C is consistently transformed into multiple smaller horizontal segments of the same color C (holes=0, pixels=4-18, elongated bboxes with small y-span like [minx, y, maxx, y] or [minx, y, maxx, y+1]).
   - This affects the overall linear structure in outputs, where these segments form extended rows.
   - Examples:
     - Train input 1: Maroon (holes=3, pixels=527, [0,0,24,22]) → Train output 1: Multiple Maroon segments (e.g., pixels=12 [3,0,11,1]; pixels=12 [3,3,11,4]; plus smaller pixels=1).
     - Train input 2: Yellow (holes=4, pixels=513, [0,0,19,29]) → Train output 2: Multiple Yellow segments (e.g., pixels=18 [0,0,10,1]; pixels=18 [0,3,10,4]; pixels=4 [14,0,17,0]; smaller pixels=2).
   - Effect: Color C and high holes count of the large shape effect the creation and positioning of same-color horizontal segments in output. (Note: Exact lengths/pixel counts of segments and why holes drop to 0 are unknown.)

3. **All small shapes interact with the large multi-hole shape via position (global bbox containment)**:
   - All small shapes (pixels<=12, any color except the large shape's color) have bboxes fully contained within the large multi-hole shape's bbox in inputs.
   - This containment is disrupted in outputs (no large shape present), leading to repositioning of small shapes into a compact linear structure.
   - Examples: In both train inputs, all listed small shapes (e.g., Blues, Reds, single pixels) fall within the large Maroon (train 1, [0,0,24,22]) or Yellow (train 2, [0,0,19,29]) bbox. Outputs reposition them without this containment.
   - Effect: Position of the large shape's bbox globally affects positions of all small shapes in inputs; transformation moves small shapes out of containment. (Note: Reason for breaking containment and exact new positions are unknown; no other consistent post-transformation containment exists across both trains.)

No other specific, consistent interactions (e.g., involving Pink, Red singles, or Light Blue) were identifiable across every train input/output without inconsistency or forcing links. For instance, Red single-pixel containment varies by container color (Green in train 1, Blue in train 2), so it is not consistent. Hole count changes for non-large shapes (e.g., Blue gaining holes=1 in train 1) occur but cannot be explained consistently as tied to a single property or interaction.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 14:35:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify, extract, trim, and modify connected "objects" or components (non-background regions) from an input grid, then rearrange and concatenate them horizontally into a standardized 5-row output, likely representing isolated and cleaned puzzle elements like shapes or symbols while preserving their essential structure and order (e.g., bottom-to-top).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value (e.g., 8 in training 1, 4 in training 2); all processing revolves around distinguishing non-bg cells, but bg must be dynamically detected as g[0][0] or similar.
 * Components are 4-connected regions of non-bg cells; only large ones (>=10 cells) are considered "objects" to extract, ignoring small noise or debris.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes, but outputs must trim outer/full bg columns entirely, and handle protrusions: left-side if full-height non-bg with <=3 distinct values including 4 (suggesting a specific "handle" or artifact to remove); right-side if full-height or sparse (<=1 non-bg) with <=2 distinct values including 5 (possibly another artifact type).
 * Subtle filling rule: Sparse/single isolated 1's in a column should propagate to adjacent rows in the same column if neighboring columns have 1's nearby (within row ±1), iteratively, to "complete" incomplete shapes—but only for 1's, not other values, and only if exactly one non-bg per column initially.
 * Padding: Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, centered vertically with bg if shorter, or cropped centered if taller; no horizontal padding mentioned, but concatenation is horizontal across processed objects.
 * Ordering: Sort components by minimum row index descending (bottom-most first), then concatenate their subgrids side-by-side without separators, resulting in a wide 5-row grid.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming must preserve core shapes (e.g., don't over-trim if condition not met exactly); filling is column-wise and iterative but limited to 1's adjacent to other 1's; components might overlap or be adjacent, but extraction treats them separately; output rows must match expected exactly, including bg placements; test inputs may have more complex layouts with multiple objects vertically stacked or offset.
 * General: Grids can vary in size; empty inputs return 5 empty rows; no rotation or vertical concatenation—always horizontal after sorting; numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 represent colors or labels, with 1 often being fillable "ink" and higher numbers structural.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `trim_left_protrusions`: Condition (full height non-bg, <=3 types including 4) is too specific/fragile; over-trims or under-trims shapes, leading to extra 1's in training 1 (e.g., fails to remove protrusions properly, leaving artifacts).
 * `trim_right_protrusions`: Similar issue (full/sparse height, <=2 types including 5); condition allows num_non<=1 which is too loose, causing misalignment in training 2 (e.g., doesn't trim correctly, resulting in shifted structures).
 * `fill_sparse_ones`: Iterative filling of 1's based on adjacent columns is conceptually good but broken in scope—only checks immediate left/right columns and ±1 rows, but doesn't propagate fully or handle non-1 adjacents; causes over-filling in training 1 (e.g., adds 1's where bg expected) and under-filling in training 2.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies large components (>=10 cells) and extracts bounding subgrids, which is core to isolating objects (worked in concept but size threshold may be off for some cases).
 * Sorting by min_r descending (bottom-first) and horizontal concatenation is a good high-level structure, but fails in practice due to poor trimming/filling, leading to incorrect widths and placements.
 * Training 1: Generated has extra 1's in rows 1 and 3 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 8,8), making shapes wider/uncleaned; top/bottom rows match expected (bg borders preserved), but middle rows mismatch due to over-trimming or failed filling (unknown exact cause, but likely protrusion trim didn't remove left artifacts properly).
 * Training 2: Generated is severely mismatched—rows have wrong lengths/orders (e.g., row 0 starts with [4,6,6,6,...] but expected [4,4,4,...] with different concatenation); structures like the 6-block and 1/3/4 shapes are jumbled/shifted, likely from incorrect component ordering or over-aggressive trimming that altered bounding boxes; left-side elements (1's,4's) are misplaced compared to expected centered layout.
 * `trim_outer_bg` and `pad_to_5_rows` seem to work partially (preserve heights), but overall pipeline breaks on subtleties like exact protrusion detection.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction but misses precise cleaning rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x34 grid with dense concatenation of what seem like multiple objects (e.g., 3/4/6/7/8/9 regions), but lacks the clean isolation seen in training expecteds—e.g., rows have irregular bg placements (many 8's scattered) and shapes like a 3-block with 1's/6's appear fused or untrimmed, unlike training's separated, trimmed symbols.
 * Missing proper trimming: e.g., row 2 has [4,4,1,4,4,3,...] which looks like unremoved protrusions (1 in middle of 4's), and right side has clustered 6/1/7/8/3/9 without clear boundaries, suggesting failed left/right protrusion removal.
 * Over-filling or no filling: Sparse 1's (e.g., in row 0 positions 5-6:1,6,1) aren't propagated cleanly, leading to jagged edges; concatenation order may be wrong (bottom-first but test has top-heavy look).
 * Doesn't match expected puzzle logic: If test has multiple vertical objects (e.g., 3/4 tower left, 6/7/8/9 right), output should separate them into distinct 5-row blocks horizontally, but here they're mushed with extra widths; bg=3? (common value), but handling seems inconsistent.

[2025-10-01 14:35:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

        return []

    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]

        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()

                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))

# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify, extract, trim, and modify connected "objects" or components (non-background regions) from an input grid, then rearrange and concatenate them horizontally into a standardized 5-row output, likely representing isolated and cleaned puzzle elements like shapes or symbols while preserving their essential structure and order (e.g., bottom-to-top).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value (e.g., 8 in training 1, 4 in training 2); all processing revolves around distinguishing non-bg cells, but bg must be dynamically detected as g[0][0] or similar.
 * Components are 4-connected regions of non-bg cells; only large ones (>=10 cells) are considered "objects" to extract, ignoring small noise or debris.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes, but outputs must trim outer/full bg columns entirely, and handle protrusions: left-side if full-height non-bg with <=3 distinct values including 4 (suggesting a specific "handle" or artifact to remove); right-side if full-height or sparse (<=1 non-bg) with <=2 distinct values including 5 (possibly another artifact type).
 * Subtle filling rule: Sparse/single isolated 1's in a column should propagate to adjacent rows in the same column if neighboring columns have 1's nearby (within row ±1), iteratively, to "complete" incomplete shapes—but only for 1's, not other values, and only if exactly one non-bg per column initially.
 * Padding: Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, centered vertically with bg if shorter, or cropped centered if taller; no horizontal padding mentioned, but concatenation is horizontal across processed objects.
 * Ordering: Sort components by minimum row index descending (bottom-most first), then concatenate their subgrids side-by-side without separators, resulting in a wide 5-row grid.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming must preserve core shapes (e.g., don't over-trim if condition not met exactly); filling is column-wise and iterative but limited to 1's adjacent to other 1's; components might overlap or be adjacent, but extraction treats them separately; output rows must match expected exactly, including bg placements; test inputs may have more complex layouts with multiple objects vertically stacked or offset.
 * General: Grids can vary in size; empty inputs return 5 empty rows; no rotation or vertical concatenation—always horizontal after sorting; numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 represent colors or labels, with 1 often being fillable "ink" and higher numbers structural.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `trim_left_protrusions`: Condition (full height non-bg, <=3 types including 4) is too specific/fragile; over-trims or under-trims shapes, leading to extra 1's in training 1 (e.g., fails to remove protrusions properly, leaving artifacts).
 * `trim_right_protrusions`: Similar issue (full/sparse height, <=2 types including 5); condition allows num_non<=1 which is too loose, causing misalignment in training 2 (e.g., doesn't trim correctly, resulting in shifted structures).
 * `fill_sparse_ones`: Iterative filling of 1's based on adjacent columns is conceptually good but broken in scope—only checks immediate left/right columns and ±1 rows, but doesn't propagate fully or handle non-1 adjacents; causes over-filling in training 1 (e.g., adds 1's where bg expected) and under-filling in training 2.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies large components (>=10 cells) and extracts bounding subgrids, which is core to isolating objects (worked in concept but size threshold may be off for some cases).
 * Sorting by min_r descending (bottom-first) and horizontal concatenation is a good high-level structure, but fails in practice due to poor trimming/filling, leading to incorrect widths and placements.
 * Training 1: Generated has extra 1's in rows 1 and 3 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 8,8), making shapes wider/uncleaned; top/bottom rows match expected (bg borders preserved), but middle rows mismatch due to over-trimming or failed filling (unknown exact cause, but likely protrusion trim didn't remove left artifacts properly).
 * Training 2: Generated is severely mismatched—rows have wrong lengths/orders (e.g., row 0 starts with [4,6,6,6,...] but expected [4,4,4,...] with different concatenation); structures like the 6-block and 1/3/4 shapes are jumbled/shifted, likely from incorrect component ordering or over-aggressive trimming that altered bounding boxes; left-side elements (1's,4's) are misplaced compared to expected centered layout.
 * `trim_outer_bg` and `pad_to_5_rows` seem to work partially (preserve heights), but overall pipeline breaks on subtleties like exact protrusion detection.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction but misses precise cleaning rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x34 grid with dense concatenation of what seem like multiple objects (e.g., 3/4/6/7/8/9 regions), but lacks the clean isolation seen in training expecteds—e.g., rows have irregular bg placements (many 8's scattered) and shapes like a 3-block with 1's/6's appear fused or untrimmed, unlike training's separated, trimmed symbols.
 * Missing proper trimming: e.g., row 2 has [4,4,1,4,4,3,...] which looks like unremoved protrusions (1 in middle of 4's), and right side has clustered 6/1/7/8/3/9 without clear boundaries, suggesting failed left/right protrusion removal.
 * Over-filling or no filling: Sparse 1's (e.g., in row 0 positions 5-6:1,6,1) aren't propagated cleanly, leading to jagged edges; concatenation order may be wrong (bottom-first but test has top-heavy look).
 * Doesn't match expected puzzle logic: If test has multiple vertical objects (e.g., 3/4 tower left, 6/7/8/9 right), output should separate them into distinct 5-row blocks horizontally, but here they're mushed with extra widths; bg=3? (common value), but handling seems inconsistent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large connected components of non-background cells (objects or blobs), extracting minimal bounding subgrids for each, trimming extraneous background and protrusion columns based on specific rules, padding them to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenating these subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output, sorted by the topmost row position of each component (descending order to prioritize higher components).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all components must exclude bg cells and only consider 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Only include components with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are omitted entirely.
 * After bounding box extraction, trim outer pure-bg columns from left/right, but do not trim rows (vertical trimming is not applied).
 * Trim "protrusions" iteratively from left/right: remove a column if its non-bg cells have <=2 unique values including 4 or 5, or exactly 1 unique value of 8 (this seems to target thin, simple extensions like lines or bars, but may over-trim complex shapes).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the subgrid if shorter or truncating from center if longer (though truncation is rare given component sizes).
 * Sort components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then concatenate their 5-row subgrids side-by-side into the output; no vertical stacking or other arrangements.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with varying column lengths per row only if subgrids have different widths, but in practice, they should align as a flat concatenation.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are value-specific (e.g., 4/5/8 trigger removal), suggesting the grid uses numbered cells representing colors/shapes, and protrusions are often uniform or low-variety "noise" like borders or antennas.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are separated by bg; bounding boxes may include internal bg holes, which are preserved (no infilling).
 * Easy to miss: Sorting is by -minr (top-first), not by left position or size; if multiple top-aligned, order is unstable (as-is from discovery).
 * Empty input or no large components should return 5 empty rows.
 * Potential over-trimming: The protrusion rule may remove valid parts of objects if they match the criteria (e.g., a column with only 4's and 5's gets trimmed even if integral to the shape).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; it correctly identifies large components and extracts/concatenates them, but fails on trimming and arrangement.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 9's in top/bottom rows (e.g., [6,8,9,9,8,...] vs expected [6,8,9,8,8,...] with single 9), and inner structure mismatches (e.g., row2 has 4,4 vs expected 4,1; overall shape bloated on left with duplicated 1's and 8's), likely due to over-retention of bg or protrusion columns; right side (2's/3's) is close but shifted.
 * Train 1: Sorting by -minr works in concept, but concatenation includes untrimmed parts, leading to wider-than-expected output (13 cols vs expected 12).
 * Train 2: Generated a symmetric but incorrect layout with 6's on left/top and duplicated patterns (e.g., row0 starts [6,6,6,4,...] vs expected [4,4,4,...] with 6's later); right side has 1's/3's mismatched (e.g., row1 ends [...,3,3,1] vs expected [...,3,3,1] but overall order wrong, with 20+ cols vs expected 22); suggests wrong component discovery or trimming removed too much/too little, flipping left/right elements.
 * Train 2: Protrusion trimming likely failed to remove intended bars (e.g., 6's or 8's), causing misaligned concatenation; expected has longer, more spread-out components including 8's not in generated.
 * Over-trimming in protrusions: Rule catches simple columns (e.g., all 8's or 4/5 mixes) but may spare complex ones incorrectly, or vice versa; in train1, it didn't trim enough to remove extra 9's.
 * find_large_components is helpful and likely correct (size threshold and connectivity match needs), but may include bg-adjacent noise if threshold too low.
 * trim_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Its criteria (ls<=2 with 4/5, or single 8) are too narrow/specific, missing other protrusion types (e.g., 6's, 9's, or 1/2/3 mixes in examples); it under-trims in train1 (extra 9's) and over-trims or misapplies in train2 (wrong symmetry); do not use without generalization (e.g., expand to more values or count non-bg density).
 * get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows are helpful and seem correct, preserving shapes and standardizing height.
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but insufficient alone; needs better protrusion handling.
 * Overall program: Concatenation logic is close (horizontal, top-sorted), but fails due to upstream trimming errors; empty handling is good.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 5-row grid with inconsistent widths (row0: 26 elements, row1: 26, row2: 26, row3: 26, row4: 26, but visually misaligned in listing), featuring clustered numbers like multiple 3's/8's on left/middle and 1's/6's/7's/9's scattered, suggesting multiple components were found and concatenated but poorly trimmed (e.g., excess 8's as bg intrusions, untrimmed protrusions like vertical 3's or 6's).
 * Compared to training failures, it inherits issues: Likely over-retention of bg/protrusions (e.g., lines of 8's or 3's that should be trimmed), wrong sorting (components appear jumbled, not strictly top-first), and value mismatches (7's and 9's prominent, possibly untrimmed edges like in train1).
 * Does not make sense as a clean puzzle solution: Output has dense, asymmetric blobs (e.g., row4 ends with 1,1,1,3,3,3 but starts with 3,8,8,...), lacking the structured symmetry or separation seen in expected training outputs; probably includes small/noisy components or fails to isolate core shapes (e.g., the 7's might be protrusions not caught by trim rules).
 * To handle test: Need broader trimming (e.g., remove columns with <50% non-bg or specific patterns beyond 4/5/8), verify component count/order against expected (test seems to have 3-4 objects based on shifts at cols ~6,12,20), and ensure no internal bg inflation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.

    # Directions: up, down, left, right only (no diagonals).

```

def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns across all rows; returns empty if fully bg.
    # Basic cleanup; works well for outer padding.
```
```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or crops to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering vertically if short, or cropping from top if tall.
    # Handles height normalization; note: width unchanged, assumes sub is non-empty.
```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on unique non-bg values (<=3 incl. 4 or single 8); over-specific to numbers, causes incorrect trimming in train2 (e.g., removes parts of main object).
    # Broken/not general: Fails when patterns don't match exact conditions, leading to asymmetric or incomplete shapes.
    # Do not reuse without generalization.
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:40:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing symbols or colors on a background (bg, often 0 or similar), where the goal is to identify large connected non-background components (objects/symbols), extract and clean them via bounding boxes, trim extraneous backgrounds and protrusions based on shape heuristics, apply special framing rules for incomplete shapes, pad them to exactly 5 rows, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered by their vertical position in the original grid (top-to-bottom or similar).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "large" components as connected (4-directional adjacency) groups of non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller ones are ignored as noise.
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg from bg.
 * Extraction uses bounding subgrids, but must handle irregular shapes by trimming outer pure-bg columns (left/right/top/bottom implicitly via bounding).
 * Trimming protrusions is heuristic and shape-specific: left-side checks column diversity (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 triggers trim; single 1 after pending; single 8 resets pending); right-side similar but with 5/3/8 patterns— these seem tailored to specific symbol "artifacts" like stems or bars, but are brittle and miss general cases.
 * Special framing rule only for exactly 5-high subgrids: if uniform left column (non-bg), and right column has matching top/bot (non-bg, !=left), with a single 4 in rows 1-3 on right, then extend right by 3 columns of bg and place 1s in the "k" row— this is a very narrow fix for one incomplete frame type, easy to miss or overapply.
 * Padding to 5 rows: center vertically with bg rows if <5, truncate center if >5; widths preserved but concatenated horizontally.
 * Ordering: sort by minimum row index of component (descending/reverse, so topmost first?), then extend each output row by appending the processed subgrid's row.
 * Subtleties: Components may overlap in projection but are processed separately; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if empty (all bg or []); handle empty grids gracefully; protrusion trims can loop and chain (e.g., pending state across iterations); no rotation/flipping; assumes grid is rectangular; potential for multiple components per "symbol" but code treats each >=10 separately.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming doesn't handle top/bottom protrusions explicitly (only left/right); special frame adds fixed 3 columns, which may not generalize; concatenation assumes all subgrids same height post-pad (5), but widths vary; bg padding must match subgrid width; component finding uses DFS/stack, which is fine but must mark visited to avoid overlap.
 * General: Puzzle likely renders "text" or "symbols" via these objects; failures often from over-trimming/under-trimming or wrong ordering, leading to shape distortions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Extracts connected components of non-bg cells (4-dir) with size >=10 using DFS/stack and visited matrix.
    # Useful for isolating objects; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Works well as core extraction step.
```

```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes tight bounding box subgrid for a component, slicing original grid.
    # Essential for isolating each object without extra bg.
```

```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or truncates to exactly 5 rows, centering with bg rows; preserves width.
    # Helpful for standardization, but note: if h>5, it crops center—may lose top/bot details if asymmetric.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Trims pure-bg columns from left/right (vertical strips).
    # Basic but useful; doesn't handle top/bottom explicitly (could be added).
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on left column diversity (e.g., <=3 uniq with 4; pending for 1; single 8).
    # Broken: over-trims or under-trims specific shapes, causing distortions (e.g., leaves artifacts in train1).
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar heuristic for right (with 5/3/8).
    # Broken: inconsistent with left, misses cases, leads to asymmetric shapes.
```

```python
def special_complete_frame(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Narrow rule to add 3 bg columns + 1s in one row for specific 5-high frame.
    # Unhelpful: too specific (only triggers on exact left uniform + right patterns with single 4); doesn't apply broadly and may add wrong elements.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, bounding/extracting them, basic bg trimming, and padding/concatenation framework.
 * What worked: Component detection and basic structure (e.g., outputs are always 5 rows; finds non-bg blobs >=10); ordering by min_row (reverse) seems to place top objects first; handles empty cases.
 * What didn't: Protrusion trims are flawed heuristics, leading to incomplete cleaning (e.g., leaves extra 8s or distorts shapes); special frame doesn't trigger or fix relevant cases; no top/bottom trimming, causing height issues pre-pad; concatenation works but with dirty subgrids, so overall output polluted.
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in rows 1/3—has [6,1,1,8,8,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,...], indicating failed left trim (left object not fully cleaned to 1s, left 8s as bg or protrusion); symmetric top/bot rows match, middle row2 correct, right parts ok—suggests partial trim success but missed inner details (unknown why exactly, perhaps pending state bug or wrong uniqueness check).
 * Train2: Generated is ~5x14 but wrong structure/content (e.g., starts with [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs expected much longer ~5x22 with different ordering/layout); likely missed multiple components or wrong bounding/trim (e.g., didn't extract separate left/center/right objects fully; protrusion rules over-trimmed or concatenated prematurely); expected has repeated 4s/1s patterns suggesting multiple padded symbols, but generated merges/distorts them.
 * Overall: Core extraction good, but cleaning/processing steps brittle—leads to shape errors; no handling for vertical protrusions or general symmetry enforcement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with irregular patterns (e.g., row0 has mixed 1/6/3/7/8; row2/3/4 show vertical stacks of 3/8/6/1/7/9), but it does not look correct—likely over-concatenated or under-trimmed multiple components without proper cleaning, resulting in a "smeared" look (e.g., long horizontal runs of same numbers suggest untrimmed bg or protrusions bleeding across symbols; vertical alignments like 3-8-3-3-3 in col0 imply stacked but uncleaned objects).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Without ground truth, but based on trains, it should be cleaner, separated symbols (e.g., distinct blocks of 1-9 patterns padded to 5-high, no excessive 8s as apparent bg leaks); here, it seems to have extracted ~4-5 components but failed trims (e.g., 8s in row1 col1-8 look like untrimmed right protrusion from a left symbol; 9s in row1/2 col20-22 may be a partial object). This doesn't make sense as a final "rendered" puzzle output—too noisy and asymmetric compared to train expecteds' structured, symmetric symbol rows; probably needs better left/right trim rules and top/bottom handling to isolate clean 5-high blocks.

[2025-10-01 14:40:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core component extraction via DFS (helpful, as it correctly identifies connected non-bg regions)
def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform bg color from top-left
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(comp) >= 10:
                    components.append(comp)
    return components
```

# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

    # Centers and pads/crops subgrid to exactly 5 rows with bg fill; preserves width.
    # Essential for output standardization; handles h<5 (pad top/bottom) and h>5 (crop center).

    if not sub:

        padded = [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
        return padded
    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify, extract, trim, and modify connected "objects" or components (non-background regions) from an input grid, then rearrange and concatenate them horizontally into a standardized 5-row output, likely representing isolated and cleaned puzzle elements like shapes or symbols while preserving their essential structure and order (e.g., bottom-to-top).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value (e.g., 8 in training 1, 4 in training 2); all processing revolves around distinguishing non-bg cells, but bg must be dynamically detected as g[0][0] or similar.
 * Components are 4-connected regions of non-bg cells; only large ones (>=10 cells) are considered "objects" to extract, ignoring small noise or debris.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes, but outputs must trim outer/full bg columns entirely, and handle protrusions: left-side if full-height non-bg with <=3 distinct values including 4 (suggesting a specific "handle" or artifact to remove); right-side if full-height or sparse (<=1 non-bg) with <=2 distinct values including 5 (possibly another artifact type).
 * Subtle filling rule: Sparse/single isolated 1's in a column should propagate to adjacent rows in the same column if neighboring columns have 1's nearby (within row ±1), iteratively, to "complete" incomplete shapes—but only for 1's, not other values, and only if exactly one non-bg per column initially.
 * Padding: Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, centered vertically with bg if shorter, or cropped centered if taller; no horizontal padding mentioned, but concatenation is horizontal across processed objects.
 * Ordering: Sort components by minimum row index descending (bottom-most first), then concatenate their subgrids side-by-side without separators, resulting in a wide 5-row grid.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming must preserve core shapes (e.g., don't over-trim if condition not met exactly); filling is column-wise and iterative but limited to 1's adjacent to other 1's; components might overlap or be adjacent, but extraction treats them separately; output rows must match expected exactly, including bg placements; test inputs may have more complex layouts with multiple objects vertically stacked or offset.
 * General: Grids can vary in size; empty inputs return 5 empty rows; no rotation or vertical concatenation—always horizontal after sorting; numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 represent colors or labels, with 1 often being fillable "ink" and higher numbers structural.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `trim_left_protrusions`: Condition (full height non-bg, <=3 types including 4) is too specific/fragile; over-trims or under-trims shapes, leading to extra 1's in training 1 (e.g., fails to remove protrusions properly, leaving artifacts).
 * `trim_right_protrusions`: Similar issue (full/sparse height, <=2 types including 5); condition allows num_non<=1 which is too loose, causing misalignment in training 2 (e.g., doesn't trim correctly, resulting in shifted structures).
 * `fill_sparse_ones`: Iterative filling of 1's based on adjacent columns is conceptually good but broken in scope—only checks immediate left/right columns and ±1 rows, but doesn't propagate fully or handle non-1 adjacents; causes over-filling in training 1 (e.g., adds 1's where bg expected) and under-filling in training 2.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies large components (>=10 cells) and extracts bounding subgrids, which is core to isolating objects (worked in concept but size threshold may be off for some cases).
 * Sorting by min_r descending (bottom-first) and horizontal concatenation is a good high-level structure, but fails in practice due to poor trimming/filling, leading to incorrect widths and placements.
 * Training 1: Generated has extra 1's in rows 1 and 3 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 8,8), making shapes wider/uncleaned; top/bottom rows match expected (bg borders preserved), but middle rows mismatch due to over-trimming or failed filling (unknown exact cause, but likely protrusion trim didn't remove left artifacts properly).
 * Training 2: Generated is severely mismatched—rows have wrong lengths/orders (e.g., row 0 starts with [4,6,6,6,...] but expected [4,4,4,...] with different concatenation); structures like the 6-block and 1/3/4 shapes are jumbled/shifted, likely from incorrect component ordering or over-aggressive trimming that altered bounding boxes; left-side elements (1's,4's) are misplaced compared to expected centered layout.
 * `trim_outer_bg` and `pad_to_5_rows` seem to work partially (preserve heights), but overall pipeline breaks on subtleties like exact protrusion detection.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction but misses precise cleaning rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x34 grid with dense concatenation of what seem like multiple objects (e.g., 3/4/6/7/8/9 regions), but lacks the clean isolation seen in training expecteds—e.g., rows have irregular bg placements (many 8's scattered) and shapes like a 3-block with 1's/6's appear fused or untrimmed, unlike training's separated, trimmed symbols.
 * Missing proper trimming: e.g., row 2 has [4,4,1,4,4,3,...] which looks like unremoved protrusions (1 in middle of 4's), and right side has clustered 6/1/7/8/3/9 without clear boundaries, suggesting failed left/right protrusion removal.
 * Over-filling or no filling: Sparse 1's (e.g., in row 0 positions 5-6:1,6,1) aren't propagated cleanly, leading to jagged edges; concatenation order may be wrong (bottom-first but test has top-heavy look).
 * Doesn't match expected puzzle logic: If test has multiple vertical objects (e.g., 3/4 tower left, 6/7/8/9 right), output should separate them into distinct 5-row blocks horizontally, but here they're mushed with extra widths; bg=3? (common value), but handling seems inconsistent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large connected components of non-background cells (objects or blobs), extracting minimal bounding subgrids for each, trimming extraneous background and protrusion columns based on specific rules, padding them to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenating these subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output, sorted by the topmost row position of each component (descending order to prioritize higher components).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all components must exclude bg cells and only consider 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Only include components with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are omitted entirely.
 * After bounding box extraction, trim outer pure-bg columns from left/right, but do not trim rows (vertical trimming is not applied).
 * Trim "protrusions" iteratively from left/right: remove a column if its non-bg cells have <=2 unique values including 4 or 5, or exactly 1 unique value of 8 (this seems to target thin, simple extensions like lines or bars, but may over-trim complex shapes).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the subgrid if shorter or truncating from center if longer (though truncation is rare given component sizes).
 * Sort components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then concatenate their 5-row subgrids side-by-side into the output; no vertical stacking or other arrangements.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with varying column lengths per row only if subgrids have different widths, but in practice, they should align as a flat concatenation.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are value-specific (e.g., 4/5/8 trigger removal), suggesting the grid uses numbered cells representing colors/shapes, and protrusions are often uniform or low-variety "noise" like borders or antennas.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are separated by bg; bounding boxes may include internal bg holes, which are preserved (no infilling).
 * Easy to miss: Sorting is by -minr (top-first), not by left position or size; if multiple top-aligned, order is unstable (as-is from discovery).
 * Empty input or no large components should return 5 empty rows.
 * Potential over-trimming: The protrusion rule may remove valid parts of objects if they match the criteria (e.g., a column with only 4's and 5's gets trimmed even if integral to the shape).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; it correctly identifies large components and extracts/concatenates them, but fails on trimming and arrangement.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 9's in top/bottom rows (e.g., [6,8,9,9,8,...] vs expected [6,8,9,8,8,...] with single 9), and inner structure mismatches (e.g., row2 has 4,4 vs expected 4,1; overall shape bloated on left with duplicated 1's and 8's), likely due to over-retention of bg or protrusion columns; right side (2's/3's) is close but shifted.
 * Train 1: Sorting by -minr works in concept, but concatenation includes untrimmed parts, leading to wider-than-expected output (13 cols vs expected 12).
 * Train 2: Generated a symmetric but incorrect layout with 6's on left/top and duplicated patterns (e.g., row0 starts [6,6,6,4,...] vs expected [4,4,4,...] with 6's later); right side has 1's/3's mismatched (e.g., row1 ends [...,3,3,1] vs expected [...,3,3,1] but overall order wrong, with 20+ cols vs expected 22); suggests wrong component discovery or trimming removed too much/too little, flipping left/right elements.
 * Train 2: Protrusion trimming likely failed to remove intended bars (e.g., 6's or 8's), causing misaligned concatenation; expected has longer, more spread-out components including 8's not in generated.
 * Over-trimming in protrusions: Rule catches simple columns (e.g., all 8's or 4/5 mixes) but may spare complex ones incorrectly, or vice versa; in train1, it didn't trim enough to remove extra 9's.
 * find_large_components is helpful and likely correct (size threshold and connectivity match needs), but may include bg-adjacent noise if threshold too low.
 * trim_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Its criteria (ls<=2 with 4/5, or single 8) are too narrow/specific, missing other protrusion types (e.g., 6's, 9's, or 1/2/3 mixes in examples); it under-trims in train1 (extra 9's) and over-trims or misapplies in train2 (wrong symmetry); do not use without generalization (e.g., expand to more values or count non-bg density).
 * get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows are helpful and seem correct, preserving shapes and standardizing height.
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but insufficient alone; needs better protrusion handling.
 * Overall program: Concatenation logic is close (horizontal, top-sorted), but fails due to upstream trimming errors; empty handling is good.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 5-row grid with inconsistent widths (row0: 26 elements, row1: 26, row2: 26, row3: 26, row4: 26, but visually misaligned in listing), featuring clustered numbers like multiple 3's/8's on left/middle and 1's/6's/7's/9's scattered, suggesting multiple components were found and concatenated but poorly trimmed (e.g., excess 8's as bg intrusions, untrimmed protrusions like vertical 3's or 6's).
 * Compared to training failures, it inherits issues: Likely over-retention of bg/protrusions (e.g., lines of 8's or 3's that should be trimmed), wrong sorting (components appear jumbled, not strictly top-first), and value mismatches (7's and 9's prominent, possibly untrimmed edges like in train1).
 * Does not make sense as a clean puzzle solution: Output has dense, asymmetric blobs (e.g., row4 ends with 1,1,1,3,3,3 but starts with 3,8,8,...), lacking the structured symmetry or separation seen in expected training outputs; probably includes small/noisy components or fails to isolate core shapes (e.g., the 7's might be protrusions not caught by trim rules).
 * To handle test: Need broader trimming (e.g., remove columns with <50% non-bg or specific patterns beyond 4/5/8), verify component count/order against expected (test seems to have 3-4 objects based on shifts at cols ~6,12,20), and ensure no internal bg inflation.

 * Identify "large" components as connected (4-directional adjacency) groups of non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller ones are ignored as noise.
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg from bg.
 * Extraction uses bounding subgrids, but must handle irregular shapes by trimming outer pure-bg columns (left/right/top/bottom implicitly via bounding).
 * Trimming protrusions is heuristic and shape-specific: left-side checks column diversity (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 triggers trim; single 1 after pending; single 8 resets pending); right-side similar but with 5/3/8 patterns— these seem tailored to specific symbol "artifacts" like stems or bars, but are brittle and miss general cases.
 * Special framing rule only for exactly 5-high subgrids: if uniform left column (non-bg), and right column has matching top/bot (non-bg, !=left), with a single 4 in rows 1-3 on right, then extend right by 3 columns of bg and place 1s in the "k" row— this is a very narrow fix for one incomplete frame type, easy to miss or overapply.
 * Padding to 5 rows: center vertically with bg rows if <5, truncate center if >5; widths preserved but concatenated horizontally.
 * Ordering: sort by minimum row index of component (descending/reverse, so topmost first?), then extend each output row by appending the processed subgrid's row.
 * Subtleties: Components may overlap in projection but are processed separately; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if empty (all bg or []); handle empty grids gracefully; protrusion trims can loop and chain (e.g., pending state across iterations); no rotation/flipping; assumes grid is rectangular; potential for multiple components per "symbol" but code treats each >=10 separately.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming doesn't handle top/bottom protrusions explicitly (only left/right); special frame adds fixed 3 columns, which may not generalize; concatenation assumes all subgrids same height post-pad (5), but widths vary; bg padding must match subgrid width; component finding uses DFS/stack, which is fine but must mark visited to avoid overlap.
 * General: Puzzle likely renders "text" or "symbols" via these objects; failures often from over-trimming/under-trimming or wrong ordering, leading to shape distortions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Extracts connected components of non-bg cells (4-dir) with size >=10 using DFS/stack and visited matrix.
    # Useful for isolating objects; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Works well as core extraction step.
```

```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes tight bounding box subgrid for a component, slicing original grid.
    # Essential for isolating each object without extra bg.
```

```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or truncates to exactly 5 rows, centering with bg rows; preserves width.
    # Helpful for standardization, but note: if h>5, it crops center—may lose top/bot details if asymmetric.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Trims pure-bg columns from left/right (vertical strips).
    # Basic but useful; doesn't handle top/bottom explicitly (could be added).
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on left column diversity (e.g., <=3 uniq with 4; pending for 1; single 8).
    # Broken: over-trims or under-trims specific shapes, causing distortions (e.g., leaves artifacts in train1).
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar heuristic for right (with 5/3/8).
    # Broken: inconsistent with left, misses cases, leads to asymmetric shapes.
```

```python
def special_complete_frame(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Narrow rule to add 3 bg columns + 1s in one row for specific 5-high frame.
    # Unhelpful: too specific (only triggers on exact left uniform + right patterns with single 4); doesn't apply broadly and may add wrong elements.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, bounding/extracting them, basic bg trimming, and padding/concatenation framework.
 * What worked: Component detection and basic structure (e.g., outputs are always 5 rows; finds non-bg blobs >=10); ordering by min_row (reverse) seems to place top objects first; handles empty cases.
 * What didn't: Protrusion trims are flawed heuristics, leading to incomplete cleaning (e.g., leaves extra 8s or distorts shapes); special frame doesn't trigger or fix relevant cases; no top/bottom trimming, causing height issues pre-pad; concatenation works but with dirty subgrids, so overall output polluted.
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in rows 1/3—has [6,1,1,8,8,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,...], indicating failed left trim (left object not fully cleaned to 1s, left 8s as bg or protrusion); symmetric top/bot rows match, middle row2 correct, right parts ok—suggests partial trim success but missed inner details (unknown why exactly, perhaps pending state bug or wrong uniqueness check).
 * Train2: Generated is ~5x14 but wrong structure/content (e.g., starts with [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs expected much longer ~5x22 with different ordering/layout); likely missed multiple components or wrong bounding/trim (e.g., didn't extract separate left/center/right objects fully; protrusion rules over-trimmed or concatenated prematurely); expected has repeated 4s/1s patterns suggesting multiple padded symbols, but generated merges/distorts them.
 * Overall: Core extraction good, but cleaning/processing steps brittle—leads to shape errors; no handling for vertical protrusions or general symmetry enforcement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with irregular patterns (e.g., row0 has mixed 1/6/3/7/8; row2/3/4 show vertical stacks of 3/8/6/1/7/9), but it does not look correct—likely over-concatenated or under-trimmed multiple components without proper cleaning, resulting in a "smeared" look (e.g., long horizontal runs of same numbers suggest untrimmed bg or protrusions bleeding across symbols; vertical alignments like 3-8-3-3-3 in col0 imply stacked but uncleaned objects).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Without ground truth, but based on trains, it should be cleaner, separated symbols (e.g., distinct blocks of 1-9 patterns padded to 5-high, no excessive 8s as apparent bg leaks); here, it seems to have extracted ~4-5 components but failed trims (e.g., 8s in row1 col1-8 look like untrimmed right protrusion from a left symbol; 9s in row1/2 col20-22 may be a partial object). This doesn't make sense as a final "rendered" puzzle output—too noisy and asymmetric compared to train expecteds' structured, symmetric symbol rows; probably needs better left/right trim rules and top/bottom handling to isolate clean 5-high blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Helpful for isolating objects; visited matrix prevents re-processing.
    # Directions: up, down, left, right only (no diagonals).
```

def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid bounding the component cells from the original grid.
    # Preserves original values (including internal bg or holes); essential for shape fidelity.
```
```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns across all rows; returns empty if fully bg.
    # Basic cleanup; works well for outer padding.
```
```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or crops to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering vertically if short, or cropping from top if tall.
    # Handles height normalization; note: width unchanged, assumes sub is non-empty.
```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on unique non-bg values (<=3 incl. 4 or single 8); over-specific to numbers, causes incorrect trimming in train2 (e.g., removes parts of main object).
    # Broken/not general: Fails when patterns don't match exact conditions, leading to asymmetric or incomplete shapes.
    # Do not reuse without generalization.
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 14:47:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing shapes or blobs on a background, and the goal is to extract large connected components (non-background cells), process them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, handle special shape completions, pad to exactly 5 rows, sort them by their topmost row position (descending), and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid. The output represents an arranged view of cleaned-up shapes, likely for identification or matching in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only keep those with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for components; diagonals do not count.
 * Extract the minimal bounding subgrid for each component, then trim outer pure-background columns from all sides.
 * Trim left protrusions specifically: look for columns with full-height non-background where set includes 4 and <=3 unique values, or follow-up full-height {1} or sparse {1}; similar for right with 5 instead of 4; this seems to remove "antennae" or irregular extensions based on specific numbers like 4/5 (possibly denoting edges) and 1 (possibly a connector or filler).
 * Special handling for 5-row-high subgrids: if left column is uniform non-background C, right column has matching top/bottom D != C/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows on right, then append a copy of column 1 (second column) as new column 3 and a mostly-bg column 4 with 1 at the 4's row— this appears to "complete" an incomplete shape, but only if conditions match exactly.
 * Pad subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible; if over 5 rows, crop center 5.
 * Sort processed components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then horizontally concatenate their padded rows into the output; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming must preserve shape integrity—over-trimming can remove essential parts; special completion assumes exact 5-height and specific patterns, which may not always apply.
 * Output must match expected lengths and values exactly; mismatches often come from incorrect trimming (leaving extra bg or protrusions), wrong sorting/ordering of components, or failing to filter small components.
 * Background value varies per grid (always g[0][0]), and numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 likely represent colors, labels, or shape types that must be preserved.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming uses a "pending" state to chain trims (e.g., after detecting 4/5, allow subsequent {1} columns); without this, partial trims occur.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by top row, vertical alignment is implicit.
 * If subgrid width becomes 0 after trimming, skip it entirely.

    # In train 1, possibly causes extra 1,8,8; remove or make optional.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and last) submission shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding boxes, basic bg trimming, and padding/sorting logic.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS seems solid (finds blobs >=10); bounding subgrid extraction isolates shapes accurately; vertical padding to 5 rows standardizes output; sorting by min row descending and horizontal concat handles arrangement.
 * What didn't work: Trimming functions (outer_bg, left/right protrusions) are incomplete or buggy— in train 1, generated rows have extra elements (e.g., row 0: 14 elems vs expected 12, with extra 8's; row 1: extra 1,8,8 and misplaced 2's/3's); protrusions not fully removed, leaving bg or filler 1's/8's.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated includes extra 1's and 8's in middle (e.g., row1 has [6,1,1,1,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]—extra 1,8,8, and lengths differ by 2); row2 has extra 1,1,1,1,1 vs expected cleaner [6,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3]; symmetric rows duplicated incorrectly; unknown reason for extras, possibly over-retention in trimming or special_complete_shape adding wrong columns.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Severe—generated rows much longer (e.g., row0: 23 elems vs expected 22), with misplaced 6's/4's/1's at start ( [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs [4,4,4,4,...] ); components seem extracted but not trimmed/sorted right, leading to duplicated or shifted shapes (e.g., 5,3,5 patterns appear early but expected later); protrusions like left 4's/6's not handled, causing overlap or extras.
 * Special_complete_shape likely unhelpful—may be adding phantom columns in train 1 (extras around 8's/1's).
 * Overall, core extraction works, but processing (trimming/special) fails to clean shapes, leading to polluted outputs; no small components included (good), but large ones not refined properly.
 * Function trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but only does columns—may need row trimming for full cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as the program failed both training examples with similar trimming/processing errors (extras, length mismatches, misplaced values), suggesting it would mishandle test's complex grid similarly.
 * Issues: Rows have varying lengths (e.g., row0: 34 elems, but inconsistent patterns like clustered 3's/1's/6's/4's/7's/8's/9's suggest untrimmed protrusions or incomplete component isolation; e.g., repeated 3's and 8's look like retained bg or partial shapes.
 * Missing expected cleanliness: Expected output should have distinct, trimmed shapes concatenated without extras (e.g., no long runs of 8's/bg if trimmed right); here, dense 3's/8's/9's indicate over-retention, and values like 7/9 may be from unprocessed parts.
 * Does not make sense: Patterns like vertical 3's on left and scattered 1's/4's/6's suggest multiple components concatenated but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left columns have full-height 3's that might be protrusions per rules); special shapes not completed properly, leading to asymmetric or incomplete blobs; overall too noisy compared to cleaner expected trains.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 14:47:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core component extraction via DFS (helpful, as it correctly identifies connected non-bg regions)
def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform bg color from top-left
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(comp) >= 10:
                    components.append(comp)
    return components
```

```python
# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify, extract, trim, and modify connected "objects" or components (non-background regions) from an input grid, then rearrange and concatenate them horizontally into a standardized 5-row output, likely representing isolated and cleaned puzzle elements like shapes or symbols while preserving their essential structure and order (e.g., bottom-to-top).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value (e.g., 8 in training 1, 4 in training 2); all processing revolves around distinguishing non-bg cells, but bg must be dynamically detected as g[0][0] or similar.
 * Components are 4-connected regions of non-bg cells; only large ones (>=10 cells) are considered "objects" to extract, ignoring small noise or debris.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes, but outputs must trim outer/full bg columns entirely, and handle protrusions: left-side if full-height non-bg with <=3 distinct values including 4 (suggesting a specific "handle" or artifact to remove); right-side if full-height or sparse (<=1 non-bg) with <=2 distinct values including 5 (possibly another artifact type).
 * Subtle filling rule: Sparse/single isolated 1's in a column should propagate to adjacent rows in the same column if neighboring columns have 1's nearby (within row ±1), iteratively, to "complete" incomplete shapes—but only for 1's, not other values, and only if exactly one non-bg per column initially.
 * Padding: Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, centered vertically with bg if shorter, or cropped centered if taller; no horizontal padding mentioned, but concatenation is horizontal across processed objects.
 * Ordering: Sort components by minimum row index descending (bottom-most first), then concatenate their subgrids side-by-side without separators, resulting in a wide 5-row grid.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming must preserve core shapes (e.g., don't over-trim if condition not met exactly); filling is column-wise and iterative but limited to 1's adjacent to other 1's; components might overlap or be adjacent, but extraction treats them separately; output rows must match expected exactly, including bg placements; test inputs may have more complex layouts with multiple objects vertically stacked or offset.
 * General: Grids can vary in size; empty inputs return 5 empty rows; no rotation or vertical concatenation—always horizontal after sorting; numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 represent colors or labels, with 1 often being fillable "ink" and higher numbers structural.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `trim_left_protrusions`: Condition (full height non-bg, <=3 types including 4) is too specific/fragile; over-trims or under-trims shapes, leading to extra 1's in training 1 (e.g., fails to remove protrusions properly, leaving artifacts).
 * `trim_right_protrusions`: Similar issue (full/sparse height, <=2 types including 5); condition allows num_non<=1 which is too loose, causing misalignment in training 2 (e.g., doesn't trim correctly, resulting in shifted structures).
 * `fill_sparse_ones`: Iterative filling of 1's based on adjacent columns is conceptually good but broken in scope—only checks immediate left/right columns and ±1 rows, but doesn't propagate fully or handle non-1 adjacents; causes over-filling in training 1 (e.g., adds 1's where bg expected) and under-filling in training 2.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies large components (>=10 cells) and extracts bounding subgrids, which is core to isolating objects (worked in concept but size threshold may be off for some cases).
 * Sorting by min_r descending (bottom-first) and horizontal concatenation is a good high-level structure, but fails in practice due to poor trimming/filling, leading to incorrect widths and placements.
 * Training 1: Generated has extra 1's in rows 1 and 3 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 8,8), making shapes wider/uncleaned; top/bottom rows match expected (bg borders preserved), but middle rows mismatch due to over-trimming or failed filling (unknown exact cause, but likely protrusion trim didn't remove left artifacts properly).
 * Training 2: Generated is severely mismatched—rows have wrong lengths/orders (e.g., row 0 starts with [4,6,6,6,...] but expected [4,4,4,...] with different concatenation); structures like the 6-block and 1/3/4 shapes are jumbled/shifted, likely from incorrect component ordering or over-aggressive trimming that altered bounding boxes; left-side elements (1's,4's) are misplaced compared to expected centered layout.
 * `trim_outer_bg` and `pad_to_5_rows` seem to work partially (preserve heights), but overall pipeline breaks on subtleties like exact protrusion detection.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction but misses precise cleaning rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x34 grid with dense concatenation of what seem like multiple objects (e.g., 3/4/6/7/8/9 regions), but lacks the clean isolation seen in training expecteds—e.g., rows have irregular bg placements (many 8's scattered) and shapes like a 3-block with 1's/6's appear fused or untrimmed, unlike training's separated, trimmed symbols.
 * Missing proper trimming: e.g., row 2 has [4,4,1,4,4,3,...] which looks like unremoved protrusions (1 in middle of 4's), and right side has clustered 6/1/7/8/3/9 without clear boundaries, suggesting failed left/right protrusion removal.
 * Over-filling or no filling: Sparse 1's (e.g., in row 0 positions 5-6:1,6,1) aren't propagated cleanly, leading to jagged edges; concatenation order may be wrong (bottom-first but test has top-heavy look).
 * Doesn't match expected puzzle logic: If test has multiple vertical objects (e.g., 3/4 tower left, 6/7/8/9 right), output should separate them into distinct 5-row blocks horizontally, but here they're mushed with extra widths; bg=3? (common value), but handling seems inconsistent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large connected components of non-background cells (objects or blobs), extracting minimal bounding subgrids for each, trimming extraneous background and protrusion columns based on specific rules, padding them to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenating these subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output, sorted by the topmost row position of each component (descending order to prioritize higher components).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all components must exclude bg cells and only consider 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Only include components with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are omitted entirely.
 * After bounding box extraction, trim outer pure-bg columns from left/right, but do not trim rows (vertical trimming is not applied).
 * Trim "protrusions" iteratively from left/right: remove a column if its non-bg cells have <=2 unique values including 4 or 5, or exactly 1 unique value of 8 (this seems to target thin, simple extensions like lines or bars, but may over-trim complex shapes).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the subgrid if shorter or truncating from center if longer (though truncation is rare given component sizes).
 * Sort components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then concatenate their 5-row subgrids side-by-side into the output; no vertical stacking or other arrangements.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with varying column lengths per row only if subgrids have different widths, but in practice, they should align as a flat concatenation.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are value-specific (e.g., 4/5/8 trigger removal), suggesting the grid uses numbered cells representing colors/shapes, and protrusions are often uniform or low-variety "noise" like borders or antennas.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are separated by bg; bounding boxes may include internal bg holes, which are preserved (no infilling).
 * Easy to miss: Sorting is by -minr (top-first), not by left position or size; if multiple top-aligned, order is unstable (as-is from discovery).
 * Empty input or no large components should return 5 empty rows.
 * Potential over-trimming: The protrusion rule may remove valid parts of objects if they match the criteria (e.g., a column with only 4's and 5's gets trimmed even if integral to the shape).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; it correctly identifies large components and extracts/concatenates them, but fails on trimming and arrangement.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 9's in top/bottom rows (e.g., [6,8,9,9,8,...] vs expected [6,8,9,8,8,...] with single 9), and inner structure mismatches (e.g., row2 has 4,4 vs expected 4,1; overall shape bloated on left with duplicated 1's and 8's), likely due to over-retention of bg or protrusion columns; right side (2's/3's) is close but shifted.
 * Train 1: Sorting by -minr works in concept, but concatenation includes untrimmed parts, leading to wider-than-expected output (13 cols vs expected 12).
 * Train 2: Generated a symmetric but incorrect layout with 6's on left/top and duplicated patterns (e.g., row0 starts [6,6,6,4,...] vs expected [4,4,4,...] with 6's later); right side has 1's/3's mismatched (e.g., row1 ends [...,3,3,1] vs expected [...,3,3,1] but overall order wrong, with 20+ cols vs expected 22); suggests wrong component discovery or trimming removed too much/too little, flipping left/right elements.
 * Train 2: Protrusion trimming likely failed to remove intended bars (e.g., 6's or 8's), causing misaligned concatenation; expected has longer, more spread-out components including 8's not in generated.
 * Over-trimming in protrusions: Rule catches simple columns (e.g., all 8's or 4/5 mixes) but may spare complex ones incorrectly, or vice versa; in train1, it didn't trim enough to remove extra 9's.
 * find_large_components is helpful and likely correct (size threshold and connectivity match needs), but may include bg-adjacent noise if threshold too low.
 * trim_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Its criteria (ls<=2 with 4/5, or single 8) are too narrow/specific, missing other protrusion types (e.g., 6's, 9's, or 1/2/3 mixes in examples); it under-trims in train1 (extra 9's) and over-trims or misapplies in train2 (wrong symmetry); do not use without generalization (e.g., expand to more values or count non-bg density).
 * get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows are helpful and seem correct, preserving shapes and standardizing height.
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but insufficient alone; needs better protrusion handling.
 * Overall program: Concatenation logic is close (horizontal, top-sorted), but fails due to upstream trimming errors; empty handling is good.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 5-row grid with inconsistent widths (row0: 26 elements, row1: 26, row2: 26, row3: 26, row4: 26, but visually misaligned in listing), featuring clustered numbers like multiple 3's/8's on left/middle and 1's/6's/7's/9's scattered, suggesting multiple components were found and concatenated but poorly trimmed (e.g., excess 8's as bg intrusions, untrimmed protrusions like vertical 3's or 6's).
 * Compared to training failures, it inherits issues: Likely over-retention of bg/protrusions (e.g., lines of 8's or 3's that should be trimmed), wrong sorting (components appear jumbled, not strictly top-first), and value mismatches (7's and 9's prominent, possibly untrimmed edges like in train1).
 * Does not make sense as a clean puzzle solution: Output has dense, asymmetric blobs (e.g., row4 ends with 1,1,1,3,3,3 but starts with 3,8,8,...), lacking the structured symmetry or separation seen in expected training outputs; probably includes small/noisy components or fails to isolate core shapes (e.g., the 7's might be protrusions not caught by trim rules).
 * To handle test: Need broader trimming (e.g., remove columns with <50% non-bg or specific patterns beyond 4/5/8), verify component count/order against expected (test seems to have 3-4 objects based on shifts at cols ~6,12,20), and ensure no internal bg inflation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing symbols or colors on a background (bg, often 0 or similar), where the goal is to identify large connected non-background components (objects/symbols), extract and clean them via bounding boxes, trim extraneous backgrounds and protrusions based on shape heuristics, apply special framing rules for incomplete shapes, pad them to exactly 5 rows, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered by their vertical position in the original grid (top-to-bottom or similar).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "large" components as connected (4-directional adjacency) groups of non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller ones are ignored as noise.
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg from bg.
 * Extraction uses bounding subgrids, but must handle irregular shapes by trimming outer pure-bg columns (left/right/top/bottom implicitly via bounding).
 * Trimming protrusions is heuristic and shape-specific: left-side checks column diversity (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 triggers trim; single 1 after pending; single 8 resets pending); right-side similar but with 5/3/8 patterns— these seem tailored to specific symbol "artifacts" like stems or bars, but are brittle and miss general cases.
 * Special framing rule only for exactly 5-high subgrids: if uniform left column (non-bg), and right column has matching top/bot (non-bg, !=left), with a single 4 in rows 1-3 on right, then extend right by 3 columns of bg and place 1s in the "k" row— this is a very narrow fix for one incomplete frame type, easy to miss or overapply.
 * Padding to 5 rows: center vertically with bg rows if <5, truncate center if >5; widths preserved but concatenated horizontally.
 * Ordering: sort by minimum row index of component (descending/reverse, so topmost first?), then extend each output row by appending the processed subgrid's row.
 * Subtleties: Components may overlap in projection but are processed separately; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if empty (all bg or []); handle empty grids gracefully; protrusion trims can loop and chain (e.g., pending state across iterations); no rotation/flipping; assumes grid is rectangular; potential for multiple components per "symbol" but code treats each >=10 separately.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming doesn't handle top/bottom protrusions explicitly (only left/right); special frame adds fixed 3 columns, which may not generalize; concatenation assumes all subgrids same height post-pad (5), but widths vary; bg padding must match subgrid width; component finding uses DFS/stack, which is fine but must mark visited to avoid overlap.
 * General: Puzzle likely renders "text" or "symbols" via these objects; failures often from over-trimming/under-trimming or wrong ordering, leading to shape distortions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Extracts connected components of non-bg cells (4-dir) with size >=10 using DFS/stack and visited matrix.
    # Useful for isolating objects; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Works well as core extraction step.
```

```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes tight bounding box subgrid for a component, slicing original grid.
    # Essential for isolating each object without extra bg.

def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or truncates to exactly 5 rows, centering with bg rows; preserves width.
    # Helpful for standardization, but note: if h>5, it crops center—may lose top/bot details if asymmetric.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Trims pure-bg columns from left/right (vertical strips).
    # Basic but useful; doesn't handle top/bottom explicitly (could be added).
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on left column diversity (e.g., <=3 uniq with 4; pending for 1; single 8).
    # Broken: over-trims or under-trims specific shapes, causing distortions (e.g., leaves artifacts in train1).
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar heuristic for right (with 5/3/8).
    # Broken: inconsistent with left, misses cases, leads to asymmetric shapes.
```

```python
def special_complete_frame(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Narrow rule to add 3 bg columns + 1s in one row for specific 5-high frame.
    # Unhelpful: too specific (only triggers on exact left uniform + right patterns with single 4); doesn't apply broadly and may add wrong elements.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, bounding/extracting them, basic bg trimming, and padding/concatenation framework.
 * What worked: Component detection and basic structure (e.g., outputs are always 5 rows; finds non-bg blobs >=10); ordering by min_row (reverse) seems to place top objects first; handles empty cases.
 * What didn't: Protrusion trims are flawed heuristics, leading to incomplete cleaning (e.g., leaves extra 8s or distorts shapes); special frame doesn't trigger or fix relevant cases; no top/bottom trimming, causing height issues pre-pad; concatenation works but with dirty subgrids, so overall output polluted.
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in rows 1/3—has [6,1,1,8,8,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,...], indicating failed left trim (left object not fully cleaned to 1s, left 8s as bg or protrusion); symmetric top/bot rows match, middle row2 correct, right parts ok—suggests partial trim success but missed inner details (unknown why exactly, perhaps pending state bug or wrong uniqueness check).
 * Train2: Generated is ~5x14 but wrong structure/content (e.g., starts with [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs expected much longer ~5x22 with different ordering/layout); likely missed multiple components or wrong bounding/trim (e.g., didn't extract separate left/center/right objects fully; protrusion rules over-trimmed or concatenated prematurely); expected has repeated 4s/1s patterns suggesting multiple padded symbols, but generated merges/distorts them.
 * Overall: Core extraction good, but cleaning/processing steps brittle—leads to shape errors; no handling for vertical protrusions or general symmetry enforcement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with irregular patterns (e.g., row0 has mixed 1/6/3/7/8; row2/3/4 show vertical stacks of 3/8/6/1/7/9), but it does not look correct—likely over-concatenated or under-trimmed multiple components without proper cleaning, resulting in a "smeared" look (e.g., long horizontal runs of same numbers suggest untrimmed bg or protrusions bleeding across symbols; vertical alignments like 3-8-3-3-3 in col0 imply stacked but uncleaned objects).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Without ground truth, but based on trains, it should be cleaner, separated symbols (e.g., distinct blocks of 1-9 patterns padded to 5-high, no excessive 8s as apparent bg leaks); here, it seems to have extracted ~4-5 components but failed trims (e.g., 8s in row1 col1-8 look like untrimmed right protrusion from a left symbol; 9s in row1/2 col20-22 may be a partial object). This doesn't make sense as a final "rendered" puzzle output—too noisy and asymmetric compared to train expecteds' structured, symmetric symbol rows; probably needs better left/right trim rules and top/bottom handling to isolate clean 5-high blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing shapes or blobs on a background, and the goal is to extract large connected components (non-background cells), process them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, handle special shape completions, pad to exactly 5 rows, sort them by their topmost row position (descending), and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid. The output represents an arranged view of cleaned-up shapes, likely for identification or matching in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only keep those with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for components; diagonals do not count.
 * Extract the minimal bounding subgrid for each component, then trim outer pure-background columns from all sides.
 * Trim left protrusions specifically: look for columns with full-height non-background where set includes 4 and <=3 unique values, or follow-up full-height {1} or sparse {1}; similar for right with 5 instead of 4; this seems to remove "antennae" or irregular extensions based on specific numbers like 4/5 (possibly denoting edges) and 1 (possibly a connector or filler).
 * Special handling for 5-row-high subgrids: if left column is uniform non-background C, right column has matching top/bottom D != C/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows on right, then append a copy of column 1 (second column) as new column 3 and a mostly-bg column 4 with 1 at the 4's row— this appears to "complete" an incomplete shape, but only if conditions match exactly.
 * Pad subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible; if over 5 rows, crop center 5.
 * Sort processed components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then horizontally concatenate their padded rows into the output; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming must preserve shape integrity—over-trimming can remove essential parts; special completion assumes exact 5-height and specific patterns, which may not always apply.
 * Output must match expected lengths and values exactly; mismatches often come from incorrect trimming (leaving extra bg or protrusions), wrong sorting/ordering of components, or failing to filter small components.
 * Background value varies per grid (always g[0][0]), and numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 likely represent colors, labels, or shape types that must be preserved.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming uses a "pending" state to chain trims (e.g., after detecting 4/5, allow subsequent {1} columns); without this, partial trims occur.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by top row, vertical alignment is implicit.
 * If subgrid width becomes 0 after trimming, skip it entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and last) submission shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding boxes, basic bg trimming, and padding/sorting logic.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS seems solid (finds blobs >=10); bounding subgrid extraction isolates shapes accurately; vertical padding to 5 rows standardizes output; sorting by min row descending and horizontal concat handles arrangement.
 * What didn't work: Trimming functions (outer_bg, left/right protrusions) are incomplete or buggy— in train 1, generated rows have extra elements (e.g., row 0: 14 elems vs expected 12, with extra 8's; row 1: extra 1,8,8 and misplaced 2's/3's); protrusions not fully removed, leaving bg or filler 1's/8's.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated includes extra 1's and 8's in middle (e.g., row1 has [6,1,1,1,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]—extra 1,8,8, and lengths differ by 2); row2 has extra 1,1,1,1,1 vs expected cleaner [6,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3]; symmetric rows duplicated incorrectly; unknown reason for extras, possibly over-retention in trimming or special_complete_shape adding wrong columns.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Severe—generated rows much longer (e.g., row0: 23 elems vs expected 22), with misplaced 6's/4's/1's at start ( [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs [4,4,4,4,...] ); components seem extracted but not trimmed/sorted right, leading to duplicated or shifted shapes (e.g., 5,3,5 patterns appear early but expected later); protrusions like left 4's/6's not handled, causing overlap or extras.
 * Special_complete_shape likely unhelpful—may be adding phantom columns in train 1 (extras around 8's/1's).
 * Overall, core extraction works, but processing (trimming/special) fails to clean shapes, leading to polluted outputs; no small components included (good), but large ones not refined properly.
 * Function trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but only does columns—may need row trimming for full cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as the program failed both training examples with similar trimming/processing errors (extras, length mismatches, misplaced values), suggesting it would mishandle test's complex grid similarly.
 * Issues: Rows have varying lengths (e.g., row0: 34 elems, but inconsistent patterns like clustered 3's/1's/6's/4's/7's/8's/9's suggest untrimmed protrusions or incomplete component isolation; e.g., repeated 3's and 8's look like retained bg or partial shapes.
 * Missing expected cleanliness: Expected output should have distinct, trimmed shapes concatenated without extras (e.g., no long runs of 8's/bg if trimmed right); here, dense 3's/8's/9's indicate over-retention, and values like 7/9 may be from unprocessed parts.
 * Does not make sense: Patterns like vertical 3's on left and scattered 1's/4's/6's suggest multiple components concatenated but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left columns have full-height 3's that might be protrusions per rules); special shapes not completed properly, leading to asymmetric or incomplete blobs; overall too noisy compared to cleaner expected trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Helpful for isolating objects; visited matrix prevents re-processing.
    # Directions: up, down, left, right only (no diagonals).
```
```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid bounding the component cells from the original grid.
    # Preserves original values (including internal bg or holes); essential for shape fidelity.
```
```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns across all rows; returns empty if fully bg.
    # Basic cleanup; works well for outer padding.
```
```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or crops to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering vertically if short, or cropping from top if tall.
    # Handles height normalization; note: width unchanged, assumes sub is non-empty.
```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:52:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected non-background components (objects or "blobs") must be extracted, trimmed to remove backgrounds and irregular protrusions, potentially modified with special rules (like completing frames), padded to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, sorted by the objects' original topmost row position in descending order (top-to-bottom priority).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (e.g., 6 in train1, 4 in train2 expected); all processing treats cells != bg as part of objects.
 * Only components with >=10 connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) are considered "large" and extracted; smaller ones are ignored.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes around components, then trims outer full-bg columns.
 * Trimming protrusions is asymmetric and rule-based: left side trims columns with <=3 non-bg cells containing 4 or 5, or full columns of 8; enters "pending" mode for follow-up {1,8}-only columns; right side similar but focused on 5 and 8, without the 4 condition.
 * Special rule: For 5-row subgrids, if left column is uniform non-bg color (except bg), and right has specific pattern (top/bottom matching non-bg, not equal to left color, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3), append 3 bg-padded cells with a 1 in the row matching the 4's position— this seems to "complete" an incomplete frame but is very narrow and may over-apply or miss.
 * Padding: Center-pad or crop to exactly 5 rows with bg; if >5 rows, crop from middle; if <5, symmetric bg rows top/bottom.
 * Final output: Sort extracted/padded subgrids by min_row descending (top objects first), concatenate rows horizontally; if no objects, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must preserve object integrity (e.g., don't remove core shapes); special frame only for exact 5-high cases and may add width unexpectedly; sorting ensures vertical order but assumes non-overlapping components; connected components must ignore bg strictly; potential for multiple objects per row or stacked vertically; outputs retain original colors (1-9 likely represent shapes/colors); easy to miss: protrusion rules are color-specific (e.g., 1,4,5,8) and stateful (pending flag), leading to over/under-trimming; bounding box may include extra bg if not trimmed fully; no vertical trimming mentioned, so heights vary before padding.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle asymmetric shapes (e.g., protrusions only on sides); verify component size threshold (10 may be too high/low for some); special rules might be over-generalized or buggy (e.g., applies when not needed); concatenation assumes fixed 5 rows but variable widths; test for overlapping components or bg enclaves inside objects (current flood-fill ignores inner bg holes).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Flood-fill to find connected components >=10 cells, ignoring bg; uses DFS stack.
    # Helpful for isolating objects; returns list of (row,col) lists per component.
    # Note: Assumes 4-connectivity; visited matrix prevents revisits.
```

```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid bounding the component cells.
    # Helpful as starting point for per-object processing; includes some bg edges.
```

```python

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding subgrids, and applying basic trimming/padding/concatenation/sorting.
 * What worked: Component detection via flood-fill is solid (finds non-bg blobs >=10 cells); bounding extraction and outer bg trim work for isolating rough shapes; padding to 5 rows ensures output format; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftward correctly in principle; for train1, the overall structure (e.g., three objects concatenated) is right, and colors mostly match except specific trim failures.
 * What didn't work: Protrusion trimming is incomplete/buggy— in train1, left trim failed to remove a bg column inside the first object, leaving extra 8s instead of connecting 1s (generated row1/3: 1,1,8,... vs expected 1,1,1,...; specific diff: positions 3-4 in first object have 8 where 1 expected, suggesting missed inner bg strip); right trim similar issues; special_complete_frame didn't trigger or apply correctly (no added elements visible, but may not have been needed); for train2, entire output is wrong—generated has wrong widths/heights, misplaced colors (e.g., long 4/6 runs at edges, but expected has reoriented/trimmed objects with different concatenation order/positions like 1,2,1 in row2 vs generated 3,5,6); unknown why train2 objects weren't isolated cleanly (possibly over-trimming or wrong component detection, e.g., merged separate blobs); component size threshold (10) may exclude/include wrongly; no vertical trimming, leading to uneven handling; special frame function is narrow (only 5-high, specific patterns) and likely unhelpful/broken for general cases (doesn't apply in examples but could add spurious width); trim_left/right_protrusions are overly complex/stateful and error-prone (pending logic fails on color sets like {4,5} not propagating correctly, leading to partial trims).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_large_components serves similar role and is essential; overall, attempt shows core extraction/sorting but fails on precise trimming, causing shape distortions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as a messy, wide concatenation (32 cols) with irregular patterns (e.g., scattered 1-9, long 3/8/6 runs, apparent merged blobs like vertical 3s and 4s), but lacks clean isolated objects—e.g., row0 has clustered 1,3,7,4,6 but no clear trimmed shapes; compared to train examples, expected outputs have symmetric/padded objects (e.g., train1 has clean 1/4/1 frames with 8 bg), while this has no obvious bg padding or frames, suggesting over-merging components or failed trims (e.g., untrimmed protrusions like the 7s/8s clusters); widths don't align with expected object isolation (too many cols for 3-4 objects); colors like repeated 3/6/8 indicate possible wrong bg detection or inclusion of small components; it does not match a mentally simulated correct output, which should have 3-5 trimmed 5-row objects (e.g., a left blob with 2/4/3, middle with 1/7/8 frame, right with 6/9/3) concatenated cleanly with bg spaces, but this seems to include extraneous connections (e.g., the 7 in row2/3 connects what should be separate).

[2025-10-01 14:52:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core component extraction via DFS (helpful, as it correctly identifies connected non-bg regions)
def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform bg color from top-left
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(comp) >= 10:
                    components.append(comp)
    return components
```

```python
# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:

def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Centers and pads/crops subgrid to exactly 5 rows with bg fill; preserves width.
    # Essential for output standardization; handles h<5 (pad top/bottom) and h>5 (crop center).
    # If empty, returns 5 empty rows (but code has [[bg]*0 ...], which is fine for 0-width).

        padded = [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_top)] + sub + [[bg] * w for _ in range(pad_bottom)]
        return padded
    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify, extract, trim, and modify connected "objects" or components (non-background regions) from an input grid, then rearrange and concatenate them horizontally into a standardized 5-row output, likely representing isolated and cleaned puzzle elements like shapes or symbols while preserving their essential structure and order (e.g., bottom-to-top).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value (e.g., 8 in training 1, 4 in training 2); all processing revolves around distinguishing non-bg cells, but bg must be dynamically detected as g[0][0] or similar.
 * Components are 4-connected regions of non-bg cells; only large ones (>=10 cells) are considered "objects" to extract, ignoring small noise or debris.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes, but outputs must trim outer/full bg columns entirely, and handle protrusions: left-side if full-height non-bg with <=3 distinct values including 4 (suggesting a specific "handle" or artifact to remove); right-side if full-height or sparse (<=1 non-bg) with <=2 distinct values including 5 (possibly another artifact type).
 * Subtle filling rule: Sparse/single isolated 1's in a column should propagate to adjacent rows in the same column if neighboring columns have 1's nearby (within row ±1), iteratively, to "complete" incomplete shapes—but only for 1's, not other values, and only if exactly one non-bg per column initially.
 * Padding: Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, centered vertically with bg if shorter, or cropped centered if taller; no horizontal padding mentioned, but concatenation is horizontal across processed objects.
 * Ordering: Sort components by minimum row index descending (bottom-most first), then concatenate their subgrids side-by-side without separators, resulting in a wide 5-row grid.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming must preserve core shapes (e.g., don't over-trim if condition not met exactly); filling is column-wise and iterative but limited to 1's adjacent to other 1's; components might overlap or be adjacent, but extraction treats them separately; output rows must match expected exactly, including bg placements; test inputs may have more complex layouts with multiple objects vertically stacked or offset.
 * General: Grids can vary in size; empty inputs return 5 empty rows; no rotation or vertical concatenation—always horizontal after sorting; numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 represent colors or labels, with 1 often being fillable "ink" and higher numbers structural.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `trim_left_protrusions`: Condition (full height non-bg, <=3 types including 4) is too specific/fragile; over-trims or under-trims shapes, leading to extra 1's in training 1 (e.g., fails to remove protrusions properly, leaving artifacts).
 * `trim_right_protrusions`: Similar issue (full/sparse height, <=2 types including 5); condition allows num_non<=1 which is too loose, causing misalignment in training 2 (e.g., doesn't trim correctly, resulting in shifted structures).
 * `fill_sparse_ones`: Iterative filling of 1's based on adjacent columns is conceptually good but broken in scope—only checks immediate left/right columns and ±1 rows, but doesn't propagate fully or handle non-1 adjacents; causes over-filling in training 1 (e.g., adds 1's where bg expected) and under-filling in training 2.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies large components (>=10 cells) and extracts bounding subgrids, which is core to isolating objects (worked in concept but size threshold may be off for some cases).
 * Sorting by min_r descending (bottom-first) and horizontal concatenation is a good high-level structure, but fails in practice due to poor trimming/filling, leading to incorrect widths and placements.
 * Training 1: Generated has extra 1's in rows 1 and 3 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 8,8), making shapes wider/uncleaned; top/bottom rows match expected (bg borders preserved), but middle rows mismatch due to over-trimming or failed filling (unknown exact cause, but likely protrusion trim didn't remove left artifacts properly).
 * Training 2: Generated is severely mismatched—rows have wrong lengths/orders (e.g., row 0 starts with [4,6,6,6,...] but expected [4,4,4,...] with different concatenation); structures like the 6-block and 1/3/4 shapes are jumbled/shifted, likely from incorrect component ordering or over-aggressive trimming that altered bounding boxes; left-side elements (1's,4's) are misplaced compared to expected centered layout.
 * `trim_outer_bg` and `pad_to_5_rows` seem to work partially (preserve heights), but overall pipeline breaks on subtleties like exact protrusion detection.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction but misses precise cleaning rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x34 grid with dense concatenation of what seem like multiple objects (e.g., 3/4/6/7/8/9 regions), but lacks the clean isolation seen in training expecteds—e.g., rows have irregular bg placements (many 8's scattered) and shapes like a 3-block with 1's/6's appear fused or untrimmed, unlike training's separated, trimmed symbols.
 * Missing proper trimming: e.g., row 2 has [4,4,1,4,4,3,...] which looks like unremoved protrusions (1 in middle of 4's), and right side has clustered 6/1/7/8/3/9 without clear boundaries, suggesting failed left/right protrusion removal.
 * Over-filling or no filling: Sparse 1's (e.g., in row 0 positions 5-6:1,6,1) aren't propagated cleanly, leading to jagged edges; concatenation order may be wrong (bottom-first but test has top-heavy look).
 * Doesn't match expected puzzle logic: If test has multiple vertical objects (e.g., 3/4 tower left, 6/7/8/9 right), output should separate them into distinct 5-row blocks horizontally, but here they're mushed with extra widths; bg=3? (common value), but handling seems inconsistent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large connected components of non-background cells (objects or blobs), extracting minimal bounding subgrids for each, trimming extraneous background and protrusion columns based on specific rules, padding them to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenating these subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output, sorted by the topmost row position of each component (descending order to prioritize higher components).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all components must exclude bg cells and only consider 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Only include components with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are omitted entirely.
 * After bounding box extraction, trim outer pure-bg columns from left/right, but do not trim rows (vertical trimming is not applied).
 * Trim "protrusions" iteratively from left/right: remove a column if its non-bg cells have <=2 unique values including 4 or 5, or exactly 1 unique value of 8 (this seems to target thin, simple extensions like lines or bars, but may over-trim complex shapes).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the subgrid if shorter or truncating from center if longer (though truncation is rare given component sizes).
 * Sort components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then concatenate their 5-row subgrids side-by-side into the output; no vertical stacking or other arrangements.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with varying column lengths per row only if subgrids have different widths, but in practice, they should align as a flat concatenation.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are value-specific (e.g., 4/5/8 trigger removal), suggesting the grid uses numbered cells representing colors/shapes, and protrusions are often uniform or low-variety "noise" like borders or antennas.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are separated by bg; bounding boxes may include internal bg holes, which are preserved (no infilling).
 * Easy to miss: Sorting is by -minr (top-first), not by left position or size; if multiple top-aligned, order is unstable (as-is from discovery).
 * Empty input or no large components should return 5 empty rows.
 * Potential over-trimming: The protrusion rule may remove valid parts of objects if they match the criteria (e.g., a column with only 4's and 5's gets trimmed even if integral to the shape).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; it correctly identifies large components and extracts/concatenates them, but fails on trimming and arrangement.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 9's in top/bottom rows (e.g., [6,8,9,9,8,...] vs expected [6,8,9,8,8,...] with single 9), and inner structure mismatches (e.g., row2 has 4,4 vs expected 4,1; overall shape bloated on left with duplicated 1's and 8's), likely due to over-retention of bg or protrusion columns; right side (2's/3's) is close but shifted.
 * Train 1: Sorting by -minr works in concept, but concatenation includes untrimmed parts, leading to wider-than-expected output (13 cols vs expected 12).
 * Train 2: Generated a symmetric but incorrect layout with 6's on left/top and duplicated patterns (e.g., row0 starts [6,6,6,4,...] vs expected [4,4,4,...] with 6's later); right side has 1's/3's mismatched (e.g., row1 ends [...,3,3,1] vs expected [...,3,3,1] but overall order wrong, with 20+ cols vs expected 22); suggests wrong component discovery or trimming removed too much/too little, flipping left/right elements.
 * Train 2: Protrusion trimming likely failed to remove intended bars (e.g., 6's or 8's), causing misaligned concatenation; expected has longer, more spread-out components including 8's not in generated.
 * Over-trimming in protrusions: Rule catches simple columns (e.g., all 8's or 4/5 mixes) but may spare complex ones incorrectly, or vice versa; in train1, it didn't trim enough to remove extra 9's.
 * find_large_components is helpful and likely correct (size threshold and connectivity match needs), but may include bg-adjacent noise if threshold too low.
 * trim_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Its criteria (ls<=2 with 4/5, or single 8) are too narrow/specific, missing other protrusion types (e.g., 6's, 9's, or 1/2/3 mixes in examples); it under-trims in train1 (extra 9's) and over-trims or misapplies in train2 (wrong symmetry); do not use without generalization (e.g., expand to more values or count non-bg density).
 * get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows are helpful and seem correct, preserving shapes and standardizing height.
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but insufficient alone; needs better protrusion handling.
 * Overall program: Concatenation logic is close (horizontal, top-sorted), but fails due to upstream trimming errors; empty handling is good.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 5-row grid with inconsistent widths (row0: 26 elements, row1: 26, row2: 26, row3: 26, row4: 26, but visually misaligned in listing), featuring clustered numbers like multiple 3's/8's on left/middle and 1's/6's/7's/9's scattered, suggesting multiple components were found and concatenated but poorly trimmed (e.g., excess 8's as bg intrusions, untrimmed protrusions like vertical 3's or 6's).
 * Compared to training failures, it inherits issues: Likely over-retention of bg/protrusions (e.g., lines of 8's or 3's that should be trimmed), wrong sorting (components appear jumbled, not strictly top-first), and value mismatches (7's and 9's prominent, possibly untrimmed edges like in train1).
 * Does not make sense as a clean puzzle solution: Output has dense, asymmetric blobs (e.g., row4 ends with 1,1,1,3,3,3 but starts with 3,8,8,...), lacking the structured symmetry or separation seen in expected training outputs; probably includes small/noisy components or fails to isolate core shapes (e.g., the 7's might be protrusions not caught by trim rules).
 * To handle test: Need broader trimming (e.g., remove columns with <50% non-bg or specific patterns beyond 4/5/8), verify component count/order against expected (test seems to have 3-4 objects based on shifts at cols ~6,12,20), and ensure no internal bg inflation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing symbols or colors on a background (bg, often 0 or similar), where the goal is to identify large connected non-background components (objects/symbols), extract and clean them via bounding boxes, trim extraneous backgrounds and protrusions based on shape heuristics, apply special framing rules for incomplete shapes, pad them to exactly 5 rows, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered by their vertical position in the original grid (top-to-bottom or similar).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "large" components as connected (4-directional adjacency) groups of non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller ones are ignored as noise.
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg from bg.
 * Extraction uses bounding subgrids, but must handle irregular shapes by trimming outer pure-bg columns (left/right/top/bottom implicitly via bounding).
 * Trimming protrusions is heuristic and shape-specific: left-side checks column diversity (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 triggers trim; single 1 after pending; single 8 resets pending); right-side similar but with 5/3/8 patterns— these seem tailored to specific symbol "artifacts" like stems or bars, but are brittle and miss general cases.
 * Special framing rule only for exactly 5-high subgrids: if uniform left column (non-bg), and right column has matching top/bot (non-bg, !=left), with a single 4 in rows 1-3 on right, then extend right by 3 columns of bg and place 1s in the "k" row— this is a very narrow fix for one incomplete frame type, easy to miss or overapply.
 * Padding to 5 rows: center vertically with bg rows if <5, truncate center if >5; widths preserved but concatenated horizontally.
 * Ordering: sort by minimum row index of component (descending/reverse, so topmost first?), then extend each output row by appending the processed subgrid's row.
 * Subtleties: Components may overlap in projection but are processed separately; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if empty (all bg or []); handle empty grids gracefully; protrusion trims can loop and chain (e.g., pending state across iterations); no rotation/flipping; assumes grid is rectangular; potential for multiple components per "symbol" but code treats each >=10 separately.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming doesn't handle top/bottom protrusions explicitly (only left/right); special frame adds fixed 3 columns, which may not generalize; concatenation assumes all subgrids same height post-pad (5), but widths vary; bg padding must match subgrid width; component finding uses DFS/stack, which is fine but must mark visited to avoid overlap.
 * General: Puzzle likely renders "text" or "symbols" via these objects; failures often from over-trimming/under-trimming or wrong ordering, leading to shape distortions.

    # Heuristic trim based on left column diversity (e.g., <=3 uniq with 4; pending for 1; single 8).
    # Broken: over-trims or under-trims specific shapes, causing distortions (e.g., leaves artifacts in train1).
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar heuristic for right (with 5/3/8).
    # Broken: inconsistent with left, misses cases, leads to asymmetric shapes.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, bounding/extracting them, basic bg trimming, and padding/concatenation framework.
 * What worked: Component detection and basic structure (e.g., outputs are always 5 rows; finds non-bg blobs >=10); ordering by min_row (reverse) seems to place top objects first; handles empty cases.
 * What didn't: Protrusion trims are flawed heuristics, leading to incomplete cleaning (e.g., leaves extra 8s or distorts shapes); special frame doesn't trigger or fix relevant cases; no top/bottom trimming, causing height issues pre-pad; concatenation works but with dirty subgrids, so overall output polluted.
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in rows 1/3—has [6,1,1,8,8,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,...], indicating failed left trim (left object not fully cleaned to 1s, left 8s as bg or protrusion); symmetric top/bot rows match, middle row2 correct, right parts ok—suggests partial trim success but missed inner details (unknown why exactly, perhaps pending state bug or wrong uniqueness check).
 * Train2: Generated is ~5x14 but wrong structure/content (e.g., starts with [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs expected much longer ~5x22 with different ordering/layout); likely missed multiple components or wrong bounding/trim (e.g., didn't extract separate left/center/right objects fully; protrusion rules over-trimmed or concatenated prematurely); expected has repeated 4s/1s patterns suggesting multiple padded symbols, but generated merges/distorts them.
 * Overall: Core extraction good, but cleaning/processing steps brittle—leads to shape errors; no handling for vertical protrusions or general symmetry enforcement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with irregular patterns (e.g., row0 has mixed 1/6/3/7/8; row2/3/4 show vertical stacks of 3/8/6/1/7/9), but it does not look correct—likely over-concatenated or under-trimmed multiple components without proper cleaning, resulting in a "smeared" look (e.g., long horizontal runs of same numbers suggest untrimmed bg or protrusions bleeding across symbols; vertical alignments like 3-8-3-3-3 in col0 imply stacked but uncleaned objects).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Without ground truth, but based on trains, it should be cleaner, separated symbols (e.g., distinct blocks of 1-9 patterns padded to 5-high, no excessive 8s as apparent bg leaks); here, it seems to have extracted ~4-5 components but failed trims (e.g., 8s in row1 col1-8 look like untrimmed right protrusion from a left symbol; 9s in row1/2 col20-22 may be a partial object). This doesn't make sense as a final "rendered" puzzle output—too noisy and asymmetric compared to train expecteds' structured, symmetric symbol rows; probably needs better left/right trim rules and top/bottom handling to isolate clean 5-high blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing shapes or blobs on a background, and the goal is to extract large connected components (non-background cells), process them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, handle special shape completions, pad to exactly 5 rows, sort them by their topmost row position (descending), and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid. The output represents an arranged view of cleaned-up shapes, likely for identification or matching in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only keep those with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for components; diagonals do not count.
 * Extract the minimal bounding subgrid for each component, then trim outer pure-background columns from all sides.
 * Trim left protrusions specifically: look for columns with full-height non-background where set includes 4 and <=3 unique values, or follow-up full-height {1} or sparse {1}; similar for right with 5 instead of 4; this seems to remove "antennae" or irregular extensions based on specific numbers like 4/5 (possibly denoting edges) and 1 (possibly a connector or filler).
 * Special handling for 5-row-high subgrids: if left column is uniform non-background C, right column has matching top/bottom D != C/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows on right, then append a copy of column 1 (second column) as new column 3 and a mostly-bg column 4 with 1 at the 4's row— this appears to "complete" an incomplete shape, but only if conditions match exactly.
 * Pad subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible; if over 5 rows, crop center 5.
 * Sort processed components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then horizontally concatenate their padded rows into the output; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming must preserve shape integrity—over-trimming can remove essential parts; special completion assumes exact 5-height and specific patterns, which may not always apply.
 * Output must match expected lengths and values exactly; mismatches often come from incorrect trimming (leaving extra bg or protrusions), wrong sorting/ordering of components, or failing to filter small components.
 * Background value varies per grid (always g[0][0]), and numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 likely represent colors, labels, or shape types that must be preserved.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming uses a "pending" state to chain trims (e.g., after detecting 4/5, allow subsequent {1} columns); without this, partial trims occur.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by top row, vertical alignment is implicit.
 * If subgrid width becomes 0 after trimming, skip it entirely.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and last) submission shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding boxes, basic bg trimming, and padding/sorting logic.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS seems solid (finds blobs >=10); bounding subgrid extraction isolates shapes accurately; vertical padding to 5 rows standardizes output; sorting by min row descending and horizontal concat handles arrangement.
 * What didn't work: Trimming functions (outer_bg, left/right protrusions) are incomplete or buggy— in train 1, generated rows have extra elements (e.g., row 0: 14 elems vs expected 12, with extra 8's; row 1: extra 1,8,8 and misplaced 2's/3's); protrusions not fully removed, leaving bg or filler 1's/8's.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated includes extra 1's and 8's in middle (e.g., row1 has [6,1,1,1,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]—extra 1,8,8, and lengths differ by 2); row2 has extra 1,1,1,1,1 vs expected cleaner [6,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3]; symmetric rows duplicated incorrectly; unknown reason for extras, possibly over-retention in trimming or special_complete_shape adding wrong columns.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Severe—generated rows much longer (e.g., row0: 23 elems vs expected 22), with misplaced 6's/4's/1's at start ( [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs [4,4,4,4,...] ); components seem extracted but not trimmed/sorted right, leading to duplicated or shifted shapes (e.g., 5,3,5 patterns appear early but expected later); protrusions like left 4's/6's not handled, causing overlap or extras.
 * Special_complete_shape likely unhelpful—may be adding phantom columns in train 1 (extras around 8's/1's).
 * Overall, core extraction works, but processing (trimming/special) fails to clean shapes, leading to polluted outputs; no small components included (good), but large ones not refined properly.
 * Function trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but only does columns—may need row trimming for full cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as the program failed both training examples with similar trimming/processing errors (extras, length mismatches, misplaced values), suggesting it would mishandle test's complex grid similarly.
 * Issues: Rows have varying lengths (e.g., row0: 34 elems, but inconsistent patterns like clustered 3's/1's/6's/4's/7's/8's/9's suggest untrimmed protrusions or incomplete component isolation; e.g., repeated 3's and 8's look like retained bg or partial shapes.
 * Missing expected cleanliness: Expected output should have distinct, trimmed shapes concatenated without extras (e.g., no long runs of 8's/bg if trimmed right); here, dense 3's/8's/9's indicate over-retention, and values like 7/9 may be from unprocessed parts.
 * Does not make sense: Patterns like vertical 3's on left and scattered 1's/4's/6's suggest multiple components concatenated but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left columns have full-height 3's that might be protrusions per rules); special shapes not completed properly, leading to asymmetric or incomplete blobs; overall too noisy compared to cleaner expected trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected non-background components (objects or "blobs") must be extracted, trimmed to remove backgrounds and irregular protrusions, potentially modified with special rules (like completing frames), padded to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, sorted by the objects' original topmost row position in descending order (top-to-bottom priority).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (e.g., 6 in train1, 4 in train2 expected); all processing treats cells != bg as part of objects.
 * Only components with >=10 connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) are considered "large" and extracted; smaller ones are ignored.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes around components, then trims outer full-bg columns.
 * Trimming protrusions is asymmetric and rule-based: left side trims columns with <=3 non-bg cells containing 4 or 5, or full columns of 8; enters "pending" mode for follow-up {1,8}-only columns; right side similar but focused on 5 and 8, without the 4 condition.
 * Special rule: For 5-row subgrids, if left column is uniform non-bg color (except bg), and right has specific pattern (top/bottom matching non-bg, not equal to left color, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3), append 3 bg-padded cells with a 1 in the row matching the 4's position— this seems to "complete" an incomplete frame but is very narrow and may over-apply or miss.
 * Padding: Center-pad or crop to exactly 5 rows with bg; if >5 rows, crop from middle; if <5, symmetric bg rows top/bottom.
 * Final output: Sort extracted/padded subgrids by min_row descending (top objects first), concatenate rows horizontally; if no objects, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must preserve object integrity (e.g., don't remove core shapes); special frame only for exact 5-high cases and may add width unexpectedly; sorting ensures vertical order but assumes non-overlapping components; connected components must ignore bg strictly; potential for multiple objects per row or stacked vertically; outputs retain original colors (1-9 likely represent shapes/colors); easy to miss: protrusion rules are color-specific (e.g., 1,4,5,8) and stateful (pending flag), leading to over/under-trimming; bounding box may include extra bg if not trimmed fully; no vertical trimming mentioned, so heights vary before padding.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle asymmetric shapes (e.g., protrusions only on sides); verify component size threshold (10 may be too high/low for some); special rules might be over-generalized or buggy (e.g., applies when not needed); concatenation assumes fixed 5 rows but variable widths; test for overlapping components or bg enclaves inside objects (current flood-fill ignores inner bg holes).

    # Pads/crops subgrid to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering where possible.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding subgrids, and applying basic trimming/padding/concatenation/sorting.
 * What worked: Component detection via flood-fill is solid (finds non-bg blobs >=10 cells); bounding extraction and outer bg trim work for isolating rough shapes; padding to 5 rows ensures output format; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftward correctly in principle; for train1, the overall structure (e.g., three objects concatenated) is right, and colors mostly match except specific trim failures.
 * What didn't work: Protrusion trimming is incomplete/buggy— in train1, left trim failed to remove a bg column inside the first object, leaving extra 8s instead of connecting 1s (generated row1/3: 1,1,8,... vs expected 1,1,1,...; specific diff: positions 3-4 in first object have 8 where 1 expected, suggesting missed inner bg strip); right trim similar issues; special_complete_frame didn't trigger or apply correctly (no added elements visible, but may not have been needed); for train2, entire output is wrong—generated has wrong widths/heights, misplaced colors (e.g., long 4/6 runs at edges, but expected has reoriented/trimmed objects with different concatenation order/positions like 1,2,1 in row2 vs generated 3,5,6); unknown why train2 objects weren't isolated cleanly (possibly over-trimming or wrong component detection, e.g., merged separate blobs); component size threshold (10) may exclude/include wrongly; no vertical trimming, leading to uneven handling; special frame function is narrow (only 5-high, specific patterns) and likely unhelpful/broken for general cases (doesn't apply in examples but could add spurious width); trim_left/right_protrusions are overly complex/stateful and error-prone (pending logic fails on color sets like {4,5} not propagating correctly, leading to partial trims).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_large_components serves similar role and is essential; overall, attempt shows core extraction/sorting but fails on precise trimming, causing shape distortions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as a messy, wide concatenation (32 cols) with irregular patterns (e.g., scattered 1-9, long 3/8/6 runs, apparent merged blobs like vertical 3s and 4s), but lacks clean isolated objects—e.g., row0 has clustered 1,3,7,4,6 but no clear trimmed shapes; compared to train examples, expected outputs have symmetric/padded objects (e.g., train1 has clean 1/4/1 frames with 8 bg), while this has no obvious bg padding or frames, suggesting over-merging components or failed trims (e.g., untrimmed protrusions like the 7s/8s clusters); widths don't align with expected object isolation (too many cols for 3-4 objects); colors like repeated 3/6/8 indicate possible wrong bg detection or inclusion of small components; it does not match a mentally simulated correct output, which should have 3-5 trimmed 5-row objects (e.g., a left blob with 2/4/3, middle with 1/7/8 frame, right with 6/9/3) concatenated cleanly with bg spaces, but this seems to include extraneous connections (e.g., the 7 in row2/3 connects what should be separate).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Helpful for isolating objects; visited matrix prevents re-processing.
    # Directions: up, down, left, right only (no diagonals).
```
```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid bounding the component cells from the original grid.
    # Preserves original values (including internal bg or holes); essential for shape fidelity.
```
```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns across all rows; returns empty if fully bg.
    # Basic cleanup; works well for outer padding.
```
```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or crops to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering vertically if short, or cropping from top if tall.
    # Handles height normalization; note: width unchanged, assumes sub is non-empty.
```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:59:42] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-processing puzzle where large non-background connected components (representing "objects" or shapes) are extracted from an input grid, normalized through bounding, trimming protrusions and backgrounds, optional special completions for specific patterns, and padding to exactly 5 rows, then concatenated horizontally in top-to-bottom order to form a final 5-row output grid. The goal is to clean and arrange these objects to match an expected composite image, likely for a rebus or shape-based riddle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify background as the value at g[0][0] and only process components of size >=10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for flood-fill to find components; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.
 * Bounding subgrid must tightly crop around the component's min/max rows/cols, but subsequent trims handle outer pure-bg columns.
 * Trimming outer bg removes full columns of bg on left/right, but only after bounding; if trimming empties the subgrid, handle gracefully (e.g., return empty rows).
 * Left protrusion trim: Iteratively remove leftmost column if non-bg cells are few (<=3 unique values including 4) or single value 1; this targets irregular "stubs" without removing core shape.
 * Right protrusion trim: Similar to left but checks for 5 in non-bg or single 1; asymmetric conditions suggest puzzle shapes have direction-specific irregularities (e.g., 4 on left, 5 on right as markers).
 * Special complete: Only for exactly 5-row subgrids; checks uniform non-bg left column (L), uniform top/bottom right column (R != bg, !=L), exactly one 4 in middle right positions (rows 1-3), then appends duplicated penultimate column, followed by two columns with 1 at the 4's row position and bg elsewhere—this seems to "fill" or symmetrize specific incomplete shapes like letters or symbols.
 * Padding: Center to 5 rows with bg if <5 (symmetric top/bottom), or crop center 5 if >5; preserves width per row.
 * Sorting: Process components by min row descending (top-first), concatenate by extending each output row with the processed sub-row; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Assumes all objects fit in 5 rows post-pad; special complete adds width (duplicates +2 cols), which may be key for train2 mismatch; protrusion trims are iterative but stop at w<=1; non-bg uniqueness checks (sets) ignore bg but count only non-bg variety.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5 empty rows; components touching edge may need no extra bg trim; multiple components per "level" aren't handled (all concatenated flatly, but sorting by minr groups vertically).
 * Potential misses: Over-trimming core shape (e.g., if protrusion conditions hit main body); special complete not triggering when it should (e.g., row count exactly 5 pre-pad); concatenation order assumes no overlaps, but visual alignment might require spacing (not implemented).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core component extraction, bounding, basic trimming, and concatenation work for simple cases.
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output is a near-mirror symmetric 5x21 grid with repeated 4/6 blocks on sides, internal 1/3/5/8 patterns, but lacks the expected framing 1's on left/right edges, has mismatched internal placements (e.g., 2 and 3's shifted, extra 8's), and shorter widths per row (21 vs expected 22); top/bottom rows identical in generated but expected has extended 1's.
 * What worked: Large component detection (>=10) and vertical sorting by minr correctly isolated objects; padding to 5 rows preserved shapes in train1.
 * What didn't: For train2, protrusion trims likely over-removed or misapplied (e.g., conditions hit core instead of stubs, removing necessary 1's for framing); special_complete probably didn't trigger or added incorrectly, leading to asymmetric/missing fills (expected has more 1's and structured 3/4/5 blocks); concatenation extended rows unevenly, causing width mismatch.
 * trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but brittle—conditions (e.g., 4/5 presence) may false-positive on complex shapes; unhelpful if shapes have >3 unique non-bg in protrusions.
 * special_complete is key for train2-like cases but overly restrictive (e.g., requires exact uniform left/right, single middle 4); didn't activate properly, missing the expected "completion" of partial symbols.
 * Overall program structure (process -> sort -> concat) is solid but fails on subtleties like exact trim conditions and special patterns, leading to distorted objects in composite.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with dense, irregular patterns (e.g., row0: 3,6,1,3's then 7,4,8,6's; heavy 3/8/6/9 clusters, some 1/7/4 accents), but it looks incorrect—appears over-trimmed or uncompleted, with jagged edges (e.g., varying densities of 3's and 8's suggest untrimmed protrusions or missed special fills) and no clear framing/separation between potential objects, unlike expected structured composites in train2.
 * Doesn't make sense visually: Lacks symmetry or clean shapes (e.g., row2 has isolated 4,8,3 then 7,3,6's; row4 has long 8's then 1,3's), probably from failing to trim properly (e.g., left/right conditions not catching 9's or 7's as protrusions) or special_complete not applying to 5-row objects, resulting in concatenated mess instead of normalized symbols.
 * Compared to train2 failure, similar issues: Missing expected 1-framing and block alignments; widths consistent (25 cols) but content mismatched (e.g., no evident top/bottom mirroring or 4/5 completions); to fix, need broader trim conditions (e.g., include 7/9 in checks) and debug special_complete triggers for test's denser grids.

[2025-10-01 14:59:42] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))

    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

        return padded
    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify, extract, trim, and modify connected "objects" or components (non-background regions) from an input grid, then rearrange and concatenate them horizontally into a standardized 5-row output, likely representing isolated and cleaned puzzle elements like shapes or symbols while preserving their essential structure and order (e.g., bottom-to-top).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value (e.g., 8 in training 1, 4 in training 2); all processing revolves around distinguishing non-bg cells, but bg must be dynamically detected as g[0][0] or similar.
 * Components are 4-connected regions of non-bg cells; only large ones (>=10 cells) are considered "objects" to extract, ignoring small noise or debris.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes, but outputs must trim outer/full bg columns entirely, and handle protrusions: left-side if full-height non-bg with <=3 distinct values including 4 (suggesting a specific "handle" or artifact to remove); right-side if full-height or sparse (<=1 non-bg) with <=2 distinct values including 5 (possibly another artifact type).
 * Subtle filling rule: Sparse/single isolated 1's in a column should propagate to adjacent rows in the same column if neighboring columns have 1's nearby (within row ±1), iteratively, to "complete" incomplete shapes—but only for 1's, not other values, and only if exactly one non-bg per column initially.
 * Padding: Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, centered vertically with bg if shorter, or cropped centered if taller; no horizontal padding mentioned, but concatenation is horizontal across processed objects.
 * Ordering: Sort components by minimum row index descending (bottom-most first), then concatenate their subgrids side-by-side without separators, resulting in a wide 5-row grid.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming must preserve core shapes (e.g., don't over-trim if condition not met exactly); filling is column-wise and iterative but limited to 1's adjacent to other 1's; components might overlap or be adjacent, but extraction treats them separately; output rows must match expected exactly, including bg placements; test inputs may have more complex layouts with multiple objects vertically stacked or offset.
 * General: Grids can vary in size; empty inputs return 5 empty rows; no rotation or vertical concatenation—always horizontal after sorting; numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 represent colors or labels, with 1 often being fillable "ink" and higher numbers structural.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `trim_left_protrusions`: Condition (full height non-bg, <=3 types including 4) is too specific/fragile; over-trims or under-trims shapes, leading to extra 1's in training 1 (e.g., fails to remove protrusions properly, leaving artifacts).
 * `trim_right_protrusions`: Similar issue (full/sparse height, <=2 types including 5); condition allows num_non<=1 which is too loose, causing misalignment in training 2 (e.g., doesn't trim correctly, resulting in shifted structures).
 * `fill_sparse_ones`: Iterative filling of 1's based on adjacent columns is conceptually good but broken in scope—only checks immediate left/right columns and ±1 rows, but doesn't propagate fully or handle non-1 adjacents; causes over-filling in training 1 (e.g., adds 1's where bg expected) and under-filling in training 2.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies large components (>=10 cells) and extracts bounding subgrids, which is core to isolating objects (worked in concept but size threshold may be off for some cases).
 * Sorting by min_r descending (bottom-first) and horizontal concatenation is a good high-level structure, but fails in practice due to poor trimming/filling, leading to incorrect widths and placements.
 * Training 1: Generated has extra 1's in rows 1 and 3 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 8,8), making shapes wider/uncleaned; top/bottom rows match expected (bg borders preserved), but middle rows mismatch due to over-trimming or failed filling (unknown exact cause, but likely protrusion trim didn't remove left artifacts properly).
 * Training 2: Generated is severely mismatched—rows have wrong lengths/orders (e.g., row 0 starts with [4,6,6,6,...] but expected [4,4,4,...] with different concatenation); structures like the 6-block and 1/3/4 shapes are jumbled/shifted, likely from incorrect component ordering or over-aggressive trimming that altered bounding boxes; left-side elements (1's,4's) are misplaced compared to expected centered layout.
 * `trim_outer_bg` and `pad_to_5_rows` seem to work partially (preserve heights), but overall pipeline breaks on subtleties like exact protrusion detection.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction but misses precise cleaning rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x34 grid with dense concatenation of what seem like multiple objects (e.g., 3/4/6/7/8/9 regions), but lacks the clean isolation seen in training expecteds—e.g., rows have irregular bg placements (many 8's scattered) and shapes like a 3-block with 1's/6's appear fused or untrimmed, unlike training's separated, trimmed symbols.
 * Missing proper trimming: e.g., row 2 has [4,4,1,4,4,3,...] which looks like unremoved protrusions (1 in middle of 4's), and right side has clustered 6/1/7/8/3/9 without clear boundaries, suggesting failed left/right protrusion removal.
 * Over-filling or no filling: Sparse 1's (e.g., in row 0 positions 5-6:1,6,1) aren't propagated cleanly, leading to jagged edges; concatenation order may be wrong (bottom-first but test has top-heavy look).
 * Doesn't match expected puzzle logic: If test has multiple vertical objects (e.g., 3/4 tower left, 6/7/8/9 right), output should separate them into distinct 5-row blocks horizontally, but here they're mushed with extra widths; bg=3? (common value), but handling seems inconsistent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large connected components of non-background cells (objects or blobs), extracting minimal bounding subgrids for each, trimming extraneous background and protrusion columns based on specific rules, padding them to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenating these subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output, sorted by the topmost row position of each component (descending order to prioritize higher components).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all components must exclude bg cells and only consider 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Only include components with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are omitted entirely.
 * After bounding box extraction, trim outer pure-bg columns from left/right, but do not trim rows (vertical trimming is not applied).
 * Trim "protrusions" iteratively from left/right: remove a column if its non-bg cells have <=2 unique values including 4 or 5, or exactly 1 unique value of 8 (this seems to target thin, simple extensions like lines or bars, but may over-trim complex shapes).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the subgrid if shorter or truncating from center if longer (though truncation is rare given component sizes).
 * Sort components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then concatenate their 5-row subgrids side-by-side into the output; no vertical stacking or other arrangements.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with varying column lengths per row only if subgrids have different widths, but in practice, they should align as a flat concatenation.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are value-specific (e.g., 4/5/8 trigger removal), suggesting the grid uses numbered cells representing colors/shapes, and protrusions are often uniform or low-variety "noise" like borders or antennas.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are separated by bg; bounding boxes may include internal bg holes, which are preserved (no infilling).
 * Easy to miss: Sorting is by -minr (top-first), not by left position or size; if multiple top-aligned, order is unstable (as-is from discovery).
 * Empty input or no large components should return 5 empty rows.
 * Potential over-trimming: The protrusion rule may remove valid parts of objects if they match the criteria (e.g., a column with only 4's and 5's gets trimmed even if integral to the shape).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; it correctly identifies large components and extracts/concatenates them, but fails on trimming and arrangement.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 9's in top/bottom rows (e.g., [6,8,9,9,8,...] vs expected [6,8,9,8,8,...] with single 9), and inner structure mismatches (e.g., row2 has 4,4 vs expected 4,1; overall shape bloated on left with duplicated 1's and 8's), likely due to over-retention of bg or protrusion columns; right side (2's/3's) is close but shifted.
 * Train 1: Sorting by -minr works in concept, but concatenation includes untrimmed parts, leading to wider-than-expected output (13 cols vs expected 12).
 * Train 2: Generated a symmetric but incorrect layout with 6's on left/top and duplicated patterns (e.g., row0 starts [6,6,6,4,...] vs expected [4,4,4,...] with 6's later); right side has 1's/3's mismatched (e.g., row1 ends [...,3,3,1] vs expected [...,3,3,1] but overall order wrong, with 20+ cols vs expected 22); suggests wrong component discovery or trimming removed too much/too little, flipping left/right elements.
 * Train 2: Protrusion trimming likely failed to remove intended bars (e.g., 6's or 8's), causing misaligned concatenation; expected has longer, more spread-out components including 8's not in generated.
 * Over-trimming in protrusions: Rule catches simple columns (e.g., all 8's or 4/5 mixes) but may spare complex ones incorrectly, or vice versa; in train1, it didn't trim enough to remove extra 9's.
 * find_large_components is helpful and likely correct (size threshold and connectivity match needs), but may include bg-adjacent noise if threshold too low.
 * trim_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Its criteria (ls<=2 with 4/5, or single 8) are too narrow/specific, missing other protrusion types (e.g., 6's, 9's, or 1/2/3 mixes in examples); it under-trims in train1 (extra 9's) and over-trims or misapplies in train2 (wrong symmetry); do not use without generalization (e.g., expand to more values or count non-bg density).
 * get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows are helpful and seem correct, preserving shapes and standardizing height.
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but insufficient alone; needs better protrusion handling.
 * Overall program: Concatenation logic is close (horizontal, top-sorted), but fails due to upstream trimming errors; empty handling is good.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 5-row grid with inconsistent widths (row0: 26 elements, row1: 26, row2: 26, row3: 26, row4: 26, but visually misaligned in listing), featuring clustered numbers like multiple 3's/8's on left/middle and 1's/6's/7's/9's scattered, suggesting multiple components were found and concatenated but poorly trimmed (e.g., excess 8's as bg intrusions, untrimmed protrusions like vertical 3's or 6's).
 * Compared to training failures, it inherits issues: Likely over-retention of bg/protrusions (e.g., lines of 8's or 3's that should be trimmed), wrong sorting (components appear jumbled, not strictly top-first), and value mismatches (7's and 9's prominent, possibly untrimmed edges like in train1).
 * Does not make sense as a clean puzzle solution: Output has dense, asymmetric blobs (e.g., row4 ends with 1,1,1,3,3,3 but starts with 3,8,8,...), lacking the structured symmetry or separation seen in expected training outputs; probably includes small/noisy components or fails to isolate core shapes (e.g., the 7's might be protrusions not caught by trim rules).
 * To handle test: Need broader trimming (e.g., remove columns with <50% non-bg or specific patterns beyond 4/5/8), verify component count/order against expected (test seems to have 3-4 objects based on shifts at cols ~6,12,20), and ensure no internal bg inflation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing symbols or colors on a background (bg, often 0 or similar), where the goal is to identify large connected non-background components (objects/symbols), extract and clean them via bounding boxes, trim extraneous backgrounds and protrusions based on shape heuristics, apply special framing rules for incomplete shapes, pad them to exactly 5 rows, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered by their vertical position in the original grid (top-to-bottom or similar).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "large" components as connected (4-directional adjacency) groups of non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller ones are ignored as noise.
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg from bg.
 * Extraction uses bounding subgrids, but must handle irregular shapes by trimming outer pure-bg columns (left/right/top/bottom implicitly via bounding).
 * Trimming protrusions is heuristic and shape-specific: left-side checks column diversity (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 triggers trim; single 1 after pending; single 8 resets pending); right-side similar but with 5/3/8 patterns— these seem tailored to specific symbol "artifacts" like stems or bars, but are brittle and miss general cases.
 * Special framing rule only for exactly 5-high subgrids: if uniform left column (non-bg), and right column has matching top/bot (non-bg, !=left), with a single 4 in rows 1-3 on right, then extend right by 3 columns of bg and place 1s in the "k" row— this is a very narrow fix for one incomplete frame type, easy to miss or overapply.
 * Padding to 5 rows: center vertically with bg rows if <5, truncate center if >5; widths preserved but concatenated horizontally.
 * Ordering: sort by minimum row index of component (descending/reverse, so topmost first?), then extend each output row by appending the processed subgrid's row.
 * Subtleties: Components may overlap in projection but are processed separately; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if empty (all bg or []); handle empty grids gracefully; protrusion trims can loop and chain (e.g., pending state across iterations); no rotation/flipping; assumes grid is rectangular; potential for multiple components per "symbol" but code treats each >=10 separately.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming doesn't handle top/bottom protrusions explicitly (only left/right); special frame adds fixed 3 columns, which may not generalize; concatenation assumes all subgrids same height post-pad (5), but widths vary; bg padding must match subgrid width; component finding uses DFS/stack, which is fine but must mark visited to avoid overlap.
 * General: Puzzle likely renders "text" or "symbols" via these objects; failures often from over-trimming/under-trimming or wrong ordering, leading to shape distortions.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, bounding/extracting them, basic bg trimming, and padding/concatenation framework.
 * What worked: Component detection and basic structure (e.g., outputs are always 5 rows; finds non-bg blobs >=10); ordering by min_row (reverse) seems to place top objects first; handles empty cases.
 * What didn't: Protrusion trims are flawed heuristics, leading to incomplete cleaning (e.g., leaves extra 8s or distorts shapes); special frame doesn't trigger or fix relevant cases; no top/bottom trimming, causing height issues pre-pad; concatenation works but with dirty subgrids, so overall output polluted.
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in rows 1/3—has [6,1,1,8,8,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,...], indicating failed left trim (left object not fully cleaned to 1s, left 8s as bg or protrusion); symmetric top/bot rows match, middle row2 correct, right parts ok—suggests partial trim success but missed inner details (unknown why exactly, perhaps pending state bug or wrong uniqueness check).
 * Train2: Generated is ~5x14 but wrong structure/content (e.g., starts with [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs expected much longer ~5x22 with different ordering/layout); likely missed multiple components or wrong bounding/trim (e.g., didn't extract separate left/center/right objects fully; protrusion rules over-trimmed or concatenated prematurely); expected has repeated 4s/1s patterns suggesting multiple padded symbols, but generated merges/distorts them.
 * Overall: Core extraction good, but cleaning/processing steps brittle—leads to shape errors; no handling for vertical protrusions or general symmetry enforcement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with irregular patterns (e.g., row0 has mixed 1/6/3/7/8; row2/3/4 show vertical stacks of 3/8/6/1/7/9), but it does not look correct—likely over-concatenated or under-trimmed multiple components without proper cleaning, resulting in a "smeared" look (e.g., long horizontal runs of same numbers suggest untrimmed bg or protrusions bleeding across symbols; vertical alignments like 3-8-3-3-3 in col0 imply stacked but uncleaned objects).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Without ground truth, but based on trains, it should be cleaner, separated symbols (e.g., distinct blocks of 1-9 patterns padded to 5-high, no excessive 8s as apparent bg leaks); here, it seems to have extracted ~4-5 components but failed trims (e.g., 8s in row1 col1-8 look like untrimmed right protrusion from a left symbol; 9s in row1/2 col20-22 may be a partial object). This doesn't make sense as a final "rendered" puzzle output—too noisy and asymmetric compared to train expecteds' structured, symmetric symbol rows; probably needs better left/right trim rules and top/bottom handling to isolate clean 5-high blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing shapes or blobs on a background, and the goal is to extract large connected components (non-background cells), process them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, handle special shape completions, pad to exactly 5 rows, sort them by their topmost row position (descending), and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid. The output represents an arranged view of cleaned-up shapes, likely for identification or matching in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only keep those with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for components; diagonals do not count.
 * Extract the minimal bounding subgrid for each component, then trim outer pure-background columns from all sides.
 * Trim left protrusions specifically: look for columns with full-height non-background where set includes 4 and <=3 unique values, or follow-up full-height {1} or sparse {1}; similar for right with 5 instead of 4; this seems to remove "antennae" or irregular extensions based on specific numbers like 4/5 (possibly denoting edges) and 1 (possibly a connector or filler).
 * Special handling for 5-row-high subgrids: if left column is uniform non-background C, right column has matching top/bottom D != C/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows on right, then append a copy of column 1 (second column) as new column 3 and a mostly-bg column 4 with 1 at the 4's row— this appears to "complete" an incomplete shape, but only if conditions match exactly.
 * Pad subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible; if over 5 rows, crop center 5.
 * Sort processed components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then horizontally concatenate their padded rows into the output; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming must preserve shape integrity—over-trimming can remove essential parts; special completion assumes exact 5-height and specific patterns, which may not always apply.
 * Output must match expected lengths and values exactly; mismatches often come from incorrect trimming (leaving extra bg or protrusions), wrong sorting/ordering of components, or failing to filter small components.
 * Background value varies per grid (always g[0][0]), and numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 likely represent colors, labels, or shape types that must be preserved.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming uses a "pending" state to chain trims (e.g., after detecting 4/5, allow subsequent {1} columns); without this, partial trims occur.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by top row, vertical alignment is implicit.
 * If subgrid width becomes 0 after trimming, skip it entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and last) submission shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding boxes, basic bg trimming, and padding/sorting logic.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS seems solid (finds blobs >=10); bounding subgrid extraction isolates shapes accurately; vertical padding to 5 rows standardizes output; sorting by min row descending and horizontal concat handles arrangement.
 * What didn't work: Trimming functions (outer_bg, left/right protrusions) are incomplete or buggy— in train 1, generated rows have extra elements (e.g., row 0: 14 elems vs expected 12, with extra 8's; row 1: extra 1,8,8 and misplaced 2's/3's); protrusions not fully removed, leaving bg or filler 1's/8's.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated includes extra 1's and 8's in middle (e.g., row1 has [6,1,1,1,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]—extra 1,8,8, and lengths differ by 2); row2 has extra 1,1,1,1,1 vs expected cleaner [6,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3]; symmetric rows duplicated incorrectly; unknown reason for extras, possibly over-retention in trimming or special_complete_shape adding wrong columns.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Severe—generated rows much longer (e.g., row0: 23 elems vs expected 22), with misplaced 6's/4's/1's at start ( [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs [4,4,4,4,...] ); components seem extracted but not trimmed/sorted right, leading to duplicated or shifted shapes (e.g., 5,3,5 patterns appear early but expected later); protrusions like left 4's/6's not handled, causing overlap or extras.
 * Special_complete_shape likely unhelpful—may be adding phantom columns in train 1 (extras around 8's/1's).
 * Overall, core extraction works, but processing (trimming/special) fails to clean shapes, leading to polluted outputs; no small components included (good), but large ones not refined properly.
 * Function trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but only does columns—may need row trimming for full cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as the program failed both training examples with similar trimming/processing errors (extras, length mismatches, misplaced values), suggesting it would mishandle test's complex grid similarly.
 * Issues: Rows have varying lengths (e.g., row0: 34 elems, but inconsistent patterns like clustered 3's/1's/6's/4's/7's/8's/9's suggest untrimmed protrusions or incomplete component isolation; e.g., repeated 3's and 8's look like retained bg or partial shapes.
 * Missing expected cleanliness: Expected output should have distinct, trimmed shapes concatenated without extras (e.g., no long runs of 8's/bg if trimmed right); here, dense 3's/8's/9's indicate over-retention, and values like 7/9 may be from unprocessed parts.
 * Does not make sense: Patterns like vertical 3's on left and scattered 1's/4's/6's suggest multiple components concatenated but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left columns have full-height 3's that might be protrusions per rules); special shapes not completed properly, leading to asymmetric or incomplete blobs; overall too noisy compared to cleaner expected trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected non-background components (objects or "blobs") must be extracted, trimmed to remove backgrounds and irregular protrusions, potentially modified with special rules (like completing frames), padded to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, sorted by the objects' original topmost row position in descending order (top-to-bottom priority).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (e.g., 6 in train1, 4 in train2 expected); all processing treats cells != bg as part of objects.
 * Only components with >=10 connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) are considered "large" and extracted; smaller ones are ignored.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes around components, then trims outer full-bg columns.
 * Trimming protrusions is asymmetric and rule-based: left side trims columns with <=3 non-bg cells containing 4 or 5, or full columns of 8; enters "pending" mode for follow-up {1,8}-only columns; right side similar but focused on 5 and 8, without the 4 condition.
 * Special rule: For 5-row subgrids, if left column is uniform non-bg color (except bg), and right has specific pattern (top/bottom matching non-bg, not equal to left color, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3), append 3 bg-padded cells with a 1 in the row matching the 4's position— this seems to "complete" an incomplete frame but is very narrow and may over-apply or miss.
 * Padding: Center-pad or crop to exactly 5 rows with bg; if >5 rows, crop from middle; if <5, symmetric bg rows top/bottom.
 * Final output: Sort extracted/padded subgrids by min_row descending (top objects first), concatenate rows horizontally; if no objects, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must preserve object integrity (e.g., don't remove core shapes); special frame only for exact 5-high cases and may add width unexpectedly; sorting ensures vertical order but assumes non-overlapping components; connected components must ignore bg strictly; potential for multiple objects per row or stacked vertically; outputs retain original colors (1-9 likely represent shapes/colors); easy to miss: protrusion rules are color-specific (e.g., 1,4,5,8) and stateful (pending flag), leading to over/under-trimming; bounding box may include extra bg if not trimmed fully; no vertical trimming mentioned, so heights vary before padding.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle asymmetric shapes (e.g., protrusions only on sides); verify component size threshold (10 may be too high/low for some); special rules might be over-generalized or buggy (e.g., applies when not needed); concatenation assumes fixed 5 rows but variable widths; test for overlapping components or bg enclaves inside objects (current flood-fill ignores inner bg holes).

    # Pads/crops subgrid to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering where possible.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding subgrids, and applying basic trimming/padding/concatenation/sorting.
 * What worked: Component detection via flood-fill is solid (finds non-bg blobs >=10 cells); bounding extraction and outer bg trim work for isolating rough shapes; padding to 5 rows ensures output format; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftward correctly in principle; for train1, the overall structure (e.g., three objects concatenated) is right, and colors mostly match except specific trim failures.
 * What didn't work: Protrusion trimming is incomplete/buggy— in train1, left trim failed to remove a bg column inside the first object, leaving extra 8s instead of connecting 1s (generated row1/3: 1,1,8,... vs expected 1,1,1,...; specific diff: positions 3-4 in first object have 8 where 1 expected, suggesting missed inner bg strip); right trim similar issues; special_complete_frame didn't trigger or apply correctly (no added elements visible, but may not have been needed); for train2, entire output is wrong—generated has wrong widths/heights, misplaced colors (e.g., long 4/6 runs at edges, but expected has reoriented/trimmed objects with different concatenation order/positions like 1,2,1 in row2 vs generated 3,5,6); unknown why train2 objects weren't isolated cleanly (possibly over-trimming or wrong component detection, e.g., merged separate blobs); component size threshold (10) may exclude/include wrongly; no vertical trimming, leading to uneven handling; special frame function is narrow (only 5-high, specific patterns) and likely unhelpful/broken for general cases (doesn't apply in examples but could add spurious width); trim_left/right_protrusions are overly complex/stateful and error-prone (pending logic fails on color sets like {4,5} not propagating correctly, leading to partial trims).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_large_components serves similar role and is essential; overall, attempt shows core extraction/sorting but fails on precise trimming, causing shape distortions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as a messy, wide concatenation (32 cols) with irregular patterns (e.g., scattered 1-9, long 3/8/6 runs, apparent merged blobs like vertical 3s and 4s), but lacks clean isolated objects—e.g., row0 has clustered 1,3,7,4,6 but no clear trimmed shapes; compared to train examples, expected outputs have symmetric/padded objects (e.g., train1 has clean 1/4/1 frames with 8 bg), while this has no obvious bg padding or frames, suggesting over-merging components or failed trims (e.g., untrimmed protrusions like the 7s/8s clusters); widths don't align with expected object isolation (too many cols for 3-4 objects); colors like repeated 3/6/8 indicate possible wrong bg detection or inclusion of small components; it does not match a mentally simulated correct output, which should have 3-5 trimmed 5-row objects (e.g., a left blob with 2/4/3, middle with 1/7/8 frame, right with 6/9/3) concatenated cleanly with bg spaces, but this seems to include extraneous connections (e.g., the 7 in row2/3 connects what should be separate).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.

    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns across all rows; returns empty if fully bg.
    # Basic cleanup; works well for outer padding.
```
```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or crops to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering vertically if short, or cropping from top if tall.
    # Handles height normalization; note: width unchanged, assumes sub is non-empty.
```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-processing puzzle where large non-background connected components (representing "objects" or shapes) are extracted from an input grid, normalized through bounding, trimming protrusions and backgrounds, optional special completions for specific patterns, and padding to exactly 5 rows, then concatenated horizontally in top-to-bottom order to form a final 5-row output grid. The goal is to clean and arrange these objects to match an expected composite image, likely for a rebus or shape-based riddle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify background as the value at g[0][0] and only process components of size >=10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for flood-fill to find components; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.
 * Bounding subgrid must tightly crop around the component's min/max rows/cols, but subsequent trims handle outer pure-bg columns.
 * Trimming outer bg removes full columns of bg on left/right, but only after bounding; if trimming empties the subgrid, handle gracefully (e.g., return empty rows).
 * Left protrusion trim: Iteratively remove leftmost column if non-bg cells are few (<=3 unique values including 4) or single value 1; this targets irregular "stubs" without removing core shape.
 * Right protrusion trim: Similar to left but checks for 5 in non-bg or single 1; asymmetric conditions suggest puzzle shapes have direction-specific irregularities (e.g., 4 on left, 5 on right as markers).
 * Special complete: Only for exactly 5-row subgrids; checks uniform non-bg left column (L), uniform top/bottom right column (R != bg, !=L), exactly one 4 in middle right positions (rows 1-3), then appends duplicated penultimate column, followed by two columns with 1 at the 4's row position and bg elsewhere—this seems to "fill" or symmetrize specific incomplete shapes like letters or symbols.
 * Padding: Center to 5 rows with bg if <5 (symmetric top/bottom), or crop center 5 if >5; preserves width per row.
 * Sorting: Process components by min row descending (top-first), concatenate by extending each output row with the processed sub-row; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Assumes all objects fit in 5 rows post-pad; special complete adds width (duplicates +2 cols), which may be key for train2 mismatch; protrusion trims are iterative but stop at w<=1; non-bg uniqueness checks (sets) ignore bg but count only non-bg variety.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5 empty rows; components touching edge may need no extra bg trim; multiple components per "level" aren't handled (all concatenated flatly, but sorting by minr groups vertically).
 * Potential misses: Over-trimming core shape (e.g., if protrusion conditions hit main body); special complete not triggering when it should (e.g., row count exactly 5 pre-pad); concatenation order assumes no overlaps, but visual alignment might require spacing (not implemented).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core component extraction, bounding, basic trimming, and concatenation work for simple cases.
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output is a near-mirror symmetric 5x21 grid with repeated 4/6 blocks on sides, internal 1/3/5/8 patterns, but lacks the expected framing 1's on left/right edges, has mismatched internal placements (e.g., 2 and 3's shifted, extra 8's), and shorter widths per row (21 vs expected 22); top/bottom rows identical in generated but expected has extended 1's.
 * What worked: Large component detection (>=10) and vertical sorting by minr correctly isolated objects; padding to 5 rows preserved shapes in train1.
 * What didn't: For train2, protrusion trims likely over-removed or misapplied (e.g., conditions hit core instead of stubs, removing necessary 1's for framing); special_complete probably didn't trigger or added incorrectly, leading to asymmetric/missing fills (expected has more 1's and structured 3/4/5 blocks); concatenation extended rows unevenly, causing width mismatch.
 * trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but brittle—conditions (e.g., 4/5 presence) may false-positive on complex shapes; unhelpful if shapes have >3 unique non-bg in protrusions.
 * special_complete is key for train2-like cases but overly restrictive (e.g., requires exact uniform left/right, single middle 4); didn't activate properly, missing the expected "completion" of partial symbols.
 * Overall program structure (process -> sort -> concat) is solid but fails on subtleties like exact trim conditions and special patterns, leading to distorted objects in composite.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with dense, irregular patterns (e.g., row0: 3,6,1,3's then 7,4,8,6's; heavy 3/8/6/9 clusters, some 1/7/4 accents), but it looks incorrect—appears over-trimmed or uncompleted, with jagged edges (e.g., varying densities of 3's and 8's suggest untrimmed protrusions or missed special fills) and no clear framing/separation between potential objects, unlike expected structured composites in train2.
 * Doesn't make sense visually: Lacks symmetry or clean shapes (e.g., row2 has isolated 4,8,3 then 7,3,6's; row4 has long 8's then 1,3's), probably from failing to trim properly (e.g., left/right conditions not catching 9's or 7's as protrusions) or special_complete not applying to 5-row objects, resulting in concatenated mess instead of normalized symbols.
 * Compared to train2 failure, similar issues: Missing expected 1-framing and block alignments; widths consistent (25 cols) but content mismatched (e.g., no evident top/bottom mirroring or 4/5 completions); to fix, need broader trim conditions (e.g., include 7/9 in checks) and debug special_complete triggers for test's denser grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on unique non-bg values (<=3 incl. 4 or single 8); over-specific to numbers, causes incorrect trimming in train2 (e.g., removes parts of main object).
    # Broken/not general: Fails when patterns don't match exact conditions, leading to asymmetric or incomplete shapes.
    # Do not reuse without generalization.
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:10:18] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to identify, extract, and standardize "objects" (connected non-background components of size >=10) from an input grid of integers (representing pixel colors/labels), then trim them according to specific protrusion and special rules, pad/crop to exactly 5 rows, and horizontally concatenate them in vertical order (top-to-bottom based on minimum row index) into a fixed 5-row output grid, preserving the background value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores or trims pure bg areas.
 * Connected components use 4-directional adjacency (up/down/left/right); only include cells != bg; must be size >=10 to qualify as an "object".
 * Bounding subgrid extracts the minimal rectangle around a component, but does not initially trim top/bottom (only left/right outer bg columns in trim_outer_bg).
 * Trimming is asymmetric and rule-based: trim_outer_bg removes full left/right columns of bg; trim_left_protrusions uses complex heuristics (e.g., column sets with <=3 types including 4, or "pending" counts of 1's, or single 8) to remove left "protrusions" iteratively; trim_right_protrusions is simpler (e.g., <=2 types including 5, or single 8).
 * apply_special is a niche rule: only for exactly 5-row subgrids with uniform non-bg left column L, right column with matching top/bottom !=bg !=L, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3 of right column; appends two new columns with a single 1 in the row matching the 4's position, rest bg— this seems to "fill" or "correct" specific shapes like incomplete letters/symbols.
 * Padding/cropping to 5 rows: if <5 rows, center-pad with bg rows (top/bottom); if >5, crop to middle 5 rows (not top or bottom aligned); no horizontal padding mentioned, but output is concatenated directly.
 * Output ordering: Sort objects by descending min_row (topmost first), then extend each output row by appending the corresponding row from each processed object horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Trimming rules are heuristic and color-specific (e.g., favoring 1,4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle encodes symbols/letters where certain numbers represent strokes (e.g., 1 for lines, 4/5/8 for curves/hooks); over-trimming can remove valid parts (e.g., turning 1's into 8's/bg); under-trimming leaves protrusions; special rule only triggers on exact 5-high; no rotation/reflection; empty input yields 5 empty rows; components may overlap in horizontal space but are processed independently; output lengths vary based on object widths post-trimming.
 * Easy-to-miss: Top/bottom trimming is absent in current code (only left/right), leading to untrimmed vertical bg; pending_count in left trim is a stateful counter for sequences of 1's, but resets unclearly; right trim lacks pending logic; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftmost, but if min_r ties, order is arbitrary (not specified); generated outputs show length mismatches, indicating width calculation errors post-trimming.

        return padded
    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction and horizontal concatenation but fails on trimming and special rules.
 * find_large_components works well (correctly identifies qualifying objects in train1, as shapes are mostly preserved).
 * trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but incomplete (only handles left/right columns, misses top/bottom full bg rows, leading to potential vertical artifacts).
 * trim_left_protrusions is over-aggressive or miscalibrated: in train1, it incorrectly trims columns containing 1's (replacing them with 8/bg), e.g., row1/4 have 8 where expected 1 (missing third 1 in left object); pending_count logic for 1's seems buggy (resets to non_bg.count(1) but decrements without clear init/reset per object).
 * trim_right_protrusions underperforms in train2: fails to align or trim right-side objects properly, resulting in mismatched widths/positions (e.g., generated has 21+ cols per row vs expected 22, with 4's and 6's shifted left).
 * apply_special did not trigger in train1 (expected no change, but trimming issue masked it); unclear if it fired in train2, but output suggests special "filling" (e.g., extra 1's) was missed.
 * pad_to_5_rows works for vertical standardization but inherits trimming errors; in train2, middle-cropping >5 row objects may have cut key parts.
 * Overall in train1: Left object trimming wrong (generated row1: [6,1,1,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,...]; same for row4; row2/3 correct), right objects intact; lengths match but content differs by one column of 8->1.
 * Overall in train2: Major misalignment—generated starts with left-heavy 4/6/1 blocks out of order (e.g., row1 has [4,6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1] vs expected [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1]); objects concatenated wrong (e.g., 5/3/6 blocks shifted, missing 8's in expected right); lengths similar but positions/contents jumbled, suggesting sort or bounding error.
 * Sorting by -min_r works directionally but may fail on tied min_r or if min_r calc ignores trims.
 * No top/bottom trim function, leading to potential unhandled vertical protrusions (unobserved in trains but likely in test).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It's a 5x27 grid (very wide), with jumbled, asymmetric shapes (e.g., row0 has scattered 3/1/6/7/8/9, row2 has dense 3/8/1/7/6/9 blocks) that don't form coherent "symbols" like in trains (e.g., no clear letter-like clusters post-trim); lengths are inconsistent across rows? No, all 27, but visually messy with repeating 3/8 patterns suggesting under-trimmed protrusions or wrong component merging.
 * Compared to trains, it over-concatenates (27 cols vs train1's 12, train2's ~22), implying too many/large objects extracted or widths not trimmed (e.g., long horizontal 3/8 runs in row1/4 look like untrimmed bg-adjacent lines).
 * Missing expected "clean" separation: e.g., row2 has [4,3,8,3,...] starting with 4 (possibly a special case), but no obvious padding or filling; likely trimming failed (left/right rules didn't handle 3/6/7/9 mixes), and ordering placed bottom objects left (if min_r sort inverted).
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution—appears raw/unprocessed grid dump rather than standardized 5-row symbols; probably extracts extra small components or skips size check; unknown why so many 3/8/9 but no 2/4/5 balance like trains.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:10:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) where the task is to identify, extract, and process large non-background connected components (shapes or "objects") by trimming borders and protrusions based on specific color patterns, padding them to a uniform 5-row height, ordering them from top to bottom in the grid, and concatenating them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and pure background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color (e.g., 0), and components are 4-way connected non-bg cells; only include components with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting a bounding box for each component, trim outer columns that are entirely bg to minimize whitespace, but avoid over-trimming to empty shapes.
 * Subtle trimming rules for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where non-bg cells are limited to specific patterns like only color 8 (ls==1 and 8 present) or small sets (ls<=3) including 4; on the right, remove columns with small sets (ls<=2) including 5—these seem to target irregular extensions or noise based on color diversity and presence of key colors (4,5,8).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the shape (using integer division for top/bottom padding).
 * Order shapes by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first), then place them side-by-side in the output without gaps or additional padding between them; total width is the sum of individual widths.
 * Handle edge cases like empty grids (return empty list), single-cell or tiny components (skip), fully trimmable shapes (skip if width becomes 0), and ensure no index errors from invalid bounds.
 * Colors like 4,5,8 appear in trimming rules, suggesting they are markers for specific structural elements (e.g., 4 for left-side features, 5 for right, 8 for uniform strips); missing these patterns preserves core shape.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows high, with width determined by concatenated shapes; if no valid shapes, output empty or all-bg 5x0 implicitly.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must not remove essential parts—e.g., don't trim if column has diverse colors or key ones absent; padding assumes h <=5, but code doesn't handle h>5 (potential crash source); component finding uses DFS/stack correctly but assumes rectangular grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Core component extraction via DFS (helpful, as it correctly identifies connected non-bg regions)
def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform bg color from top-left
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-way connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(comp) >= 10:
                    components.append(comp)
    return components
```

```python
# Bounding box extraction (helpful for isolating subgrids)
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not comp:
        return []
    minr = min(r for r, c in comp)
    maxr = max(r for r, c in comp)
    minc = min(c for r, c in comp)
    maxc = max(c for r, c in comp)
    h, w = maxr - minr + 1, maxc - minc + 1
    return [[g[minr + ii][minc + jj] for jj in range(w)] for ii in range(h)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented component finding, bounding box extraction, bg trimming, protrusion trimming (left/right based on color sets with 4,5,8), padding to 5 rows, top-to-bottom ordering, and horizontal concatenation, showing partial understanding of extraction and processing pipeline.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS correctly filters large (>=10 cells) non-bg blobs; basic bg border trimming reduces unnecessary space; ordering by minr descending prioritizes top shapes as expected.
 * What didn't work: Crashed on all inputs with execution errors—'int' has no len() on training examples 1/2 (likely from assuming non-list bg or empty subgrid in len() calls, e.g., if g[0][0] mishandled or sub empty); 'list index out of range' on test (probably from invalid minc/maxc bounds or post-trim w=0 then accessing sub[ii][jj] where jj exceeds).
 * Over-trimming logic may be too aggressive (e.g., left trim condition allows skipping columns with ls<=3 and 4 present, but unclear if it preserves core shapes); no handling for h>5 or non-rectangular components post-trim.
 * Padding assumes h<=5 but doesn't clamp or error-check, potentially causing issues if shapes are taller.
 * No validation for bg assumption (top-left cell); if grid lacks uniform bg, everything fails early.
 * The protrusion trimming function is partially helpful but broken in context (relies on post-trim sub without bounds checks, leading to index errors); avoid using without fixing len() and range guards.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core pipeline (extract -> trim -> pad -> order -> concat) but lacks robustness, causing total failure on all samples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ('list index out of range'), so it generated no valid grid—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a 5-row output with processed shapes or empty if none qualify.
 * Unlike training errors (len() on int, suggesting empty/None subgrid issues), this points to array access beyond bounds during trimming/padding (e.g., after trimming w to 0 or negative, then jj in range(w) but sub[ii] shortened incorrectly).
 * Expected test output (inferred): A 5xW grid with 1-3 top-ordered shapes concatenated, trimmed of bg/protrusions (e.g., preserving main blobs with colors like 1-9, removing side strips of 4/5/8), but since code crashed, it doesn't match—likely missing key shapes or order due to early failure.
 * No visual match possible due to error; subtleties like test-specific large/tall shapes or protrusion patterns (e.g., more 5's on right) weren't handled, exacerbating index issues.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to extract and refine large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes in a 2D grid of integers), then arranging these refined subgrids side-by-side into a fixed 5-row output, sorted by their original vertical position in the input grid. The goal is to isolate meaningful "objects" by trimming backgrounds and protrusions while preserving key structural elements like specific digit patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only retain "large" ones with at least 10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrids for each component, then trim full columns of background from left/right edges to tighten the bounds.
 * Handle left-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they contain only 1s (or after a 4-column), as these may be stems or attachments; track pending trims to chain 4-then-1 patterns.
 * Handle right-side protrusions: trim columns that are entirely non-background if they have few unique values (≤2) including 5, suggesting thin extensions.
 * Subtle duplication rule: if the rightmost column has 4 or 9 (non-background), duplicate the penultimate column to the right, possibly to symmetrize or complete shapes like loops or mirrors.
 * Pad or crop subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background fill, to standardize for output assembly.
 * Sort extracted subgrids by their minimum row index (topmost position) descending, then concatenate horizontally row-by-row to form the output; if no components, return empty 5-row grid.
 * Edge cases: empty input returns empty 5x0 grid; subgrids must be non-empty after processing; assume uniform grid dimensions and integer values (likely digits 0-9 for background/shapes).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: component connectivity is 4-directional (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); trimming stops if a column has mixed background/non-background or doesn't match protrusion criteria; duplication only appends without trimming further; output rows may have varying lengths if subgrids differ in width, but all are 5 rows high.
 * General considerations: grids may have multiple components at different heights; background can appear inside objects (holes not trimmed); no rotation or flipping; preserve exact cell values during extraction/processing.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts to find large components, extract/trim subgrids, and assemble a 5-row output, showing partial understanding of object isolation and arrangement.
 * Crashes on all inputs (training 1, training 2, test) due to invalid min/max on generator of tuples in get_bounding_subgrid: "minr, minc = min((r, c) for r, c in comp), ..." fails because min returns a single tuple, not unpacked values; similarly for max (bad operand for unary - on tuple, likely from a sort key elsewhere, but primary error is unpacking).
 * trim_outer_bg works conceptually (removes full bg columns from edges) but untested due to crash.
 * trim_left_protrusions has logic for chaining 4-then-1 trims (pending flag), but complex and untested; may over-trim if patterns misdetected.
 * trim_right_protrusions limits to ≤2 unique values with 5, but untested; could miss if >2 uniques.
 * maybe_duplicate_penultimate only triggers on right column having 4 or 9, appending penultimate—subtle but potentially key for shape completion; untested.
 * Overall assembly (sort by -minr, horizontal concat per row) is a good structure but fails due to early crash; no outputs generated, so can't assess trimming accuracy.
 * find_large_components and pad_to_5_rows seem solid and bug-free (BFS/DFS style, size filter, centering).
 * get_bounding_subgrid is broken due to min/max unpacking error—fix by computing minr/minc/maxr/maxc separately.
 * No successful processing, so unknown if protrusion rules match puzzle (e.g., why 4/1 left, 5 right, 4/9 duplicate).
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but basic; could be extended for top/bottom if needed (not in code).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error (bad operand type for unary - on tuple), identical to training examples, so no actual grid generated—does not make sense or match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Expected test output should be a valid 5-row grid with refined objects concatenated horizontally, preserving digit patterns without crashes; this attempt produces nothing usable, missing all core processing steps after component finding.
 * Error likely propagates from get_bounding_subgrid to later sort (key=lambda x: -x[0], where x[0] is minr but assignment failed earlier); confirms no output to evaluate against test input's visual rules (e.g., specific shape extractions).
 * Without generated grids, can't confirm if components are correctly sized/filtered or trims applied, but crash indicates fundamental syntax bug prevents any validation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where non-background connected components (blobs or objects) of size 5 or larger are extracted from an input grid, trimmed according to specific rules for borders and protrusions, potentially duplicated in parts, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their top-left position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid representing the "solution" arrangement of these processed objects. The background is assumed to be the value at g[0][0], and the goal is to isolate and normalize these objects while preserving their internal patterns (numbers like 1-9 representing pixel colors or shapes).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and components are 4-connected groups of non-bg cells; only include those with len(comp) >= 5 to filter noise or small artifacts.
 * After extracting the bounding subgrid for a component, trim any full outer columns of pure bg on left/right to remove padding, but do not trim top/bottom in bounding step (padding happens later).
 * Left protrusion trimming: Remove leftmost columns where non-bg cells are either a subset of {1,4}, exactly {8}, and either fill the full height (h) or are sparse (num_non <=1); this targets thin vertical "handles" or borders that are not core to the object.
 * Right protrusion trimming: Remove rightmost columns where non-bg includes 5, the set has len <=2, and again full height or sparse (<=1 non-bg); this is asymmetric and specific to certain number patterns (e.g., 5 as a marker for trimmable extensions).
 * Duplication rule: If the rightmost column after trimming has 4 or 9 in its non-bg set, duplicate the penultimate (second-to-last) column twice by appending it to the end; this seems to handle symmetric or mirrored elements in objects like frames or repeated patterns, but only applies if width >=2 post-trimming.
 * Padding: Always normalize to exactly 5 rows by cropping from center if >5, or adding bg rows top/bottom (centered) if <5; widths are preserved and concatenated without additional spacing.
 * Sorting and output: Sort processed objects by (min_row, min_col) of their original positions, then extend each of the 5 output rows by appending the corresponding sub-row; if no valid components, return empty 5x0 grid.
 * Subtle elements: Trimming conditions are highly specific to number sets (e.g., {1,4} on left vs. including 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle encodes object types via numbers (1-9 as shapes/colors); duplication is rare and conditional on 4/9 presence, easy to over-apply; components must ignore bg entirely in connectivity; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if original grid height differs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5x0; single-cell or small components ignored; overlapping bounding boxes possible but sorting handles order; no vertical concatenation—only horizontal after sorting; bg can appear inside objects post-trimming (e.g., holes), but not trimmed further.
 * All attempts so far assume 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right, no diagonals); numbers 6,8,9 often appear as borders/frames, while 1-5 are fills or details.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies bg and finds large components (>=5 cells) using DFS, which works for extracting candidates in both training examples.
 * Bounding subgrid extraction is accurate, preserving object shapes without distortion.
 * Outer bg trimming (full left/right columns) partially works but is incomplete, as it doesn't handle partial bg rows and leads to extra width in outputs.
 * Left protrusion trimming condition (subset {1,4} or {8}, full/sparse) is too permissive or misapplied, resulting in over-trimming or under-trimming; in train1, it fails to isolate the central 1/4 pattern properly.
 * Right protrusion trimming (includes 5, len<=2, full/sparse) is broken or overly specific, causing no trimming in cases with 3/2 patterns, leading to wider-than-expected objects.
 * Duplication rule (append penultimate col twice if 4/9 on right) is incorrectly triggered or applied, causing symmetric but duplicated rows in train1 generated output (e.g., row0/row4 have extra 8s and misplaced 6/9), and doesn't match expected frame-like borders.
 * Padding to 5 rows works but is applied too early or on untrimmed subs, exacerbating width issues when concatenating.
 * Sorting by (minr, minc) is correct in principle but fails due to poor subgrid quality, leading to misordered or extra objects in train1 (18 cols vs. expected 12) and train2 (24 cols vs. expected 22, with misplaced 4/1 patterns).
 * Overall, train1 generated a near-symmetric but oversized grid with duplicated 8/1 rows and wrong positioning of 6/9 borders, differing from expected by including untrimmed protrusions and extra columns (e.g., generated has 8s where expected has cleaner 6/8/9 frames and isolated 2/3 blob).
 * Train2 generated includes untrimmed left 4/1 extensions and fails to group 3/5 properly, resulting in fragmented objects (e.g., separate 4/6 blocks instead of consolidated 4/3/5/6), differing from expected by extra 4/1 columns on left and misaligned 8/bg.
 * No vertical trimming or rotation considered, which may be needed for some objects but not evident in examples.
 * The trim_outer_bg function is somewhat helpful but incomplete (only left/right, no top/bottom, and assumes uniform columns); trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are unhelpful as currently implemented due to buggy conditions—do not reuse without major fixes, as they cause the core mismatches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it is excessively wide (37 columns per row) with apparent bg (8) intrusions and fragmented patterns, suggesting multiple under-trimmed or incorrectly merged components (e.g., long stretches of 6/8/3/4 without clear object boundaries).
 * It includes what seem like partial objects (e.g., 1/3/7/8 clusters) but fails to isolate clean 5-row blocks, differing from expected clean concatenations by having irregular widths and numbers like 7/9 that may indicate untrimmed protrusions or missed duplications.
 * Patterns like repeated 3/4 columns and scattered 6/8 suggest over-extraction of connected areas without proper trimming, and the output lacks the symmetric frame-like structures seen in train1 expected (e.g., no clear 6/9 borders); this does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it appears noisy rather than normalized objects.
 * Likely missing correct left/right protrusion rules for numbers like 7/1, leading to inclusion of "handles" that should be trimmed; test case probably has 3-4 objects that should concatenate to ~20-25 cols, not 37.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify, extract, trim, and modify connected "objects" or components (non-background regions) from an input grid, then rearrange and concatenate them horizontally into a standardized 5-row output, likely representing isolated and cleaned puzzle elements like shapes or symbols while preserving their essential structure and order (e.g., bottom-to-top).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value (e.g., 8 in training 1, 4 in training 2); all processing revolves around distinguishing non-bg cells, but bg must be dynamically detected as g[0][0] or similar.
 * Components are 4-connected regions of non-bg cells; only large ones (>=10 cells) are considered "objects" to extract, ignoring small noise or debris.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes, but outputs must trim outer/full bg columns entirely, and handle protrusions: left-side if full-height non-bg with <=3 distinct values including 4 (suggesting a specific "handle" or artifact to remove); right-side if full-height or sparse (<=1 non-bg) with <=2 distinct values including 5 (possibly another artifact type).
 * Subtle filling rule: Sparse/single isolated 1's in a column should propagate to adjacent rows in the same column if neighboring columns have 1's nearby (within row ±1), iteratively, to "complete" incomplete shapes—but only for 1's, not other values, and only if exactly one non-bg per column initially.
 * Padding: Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, centered vertically with bg if shorter, or cropped centered if taller; no horizontal padding mentioned, but concatenation is horizontal across processed objects.
 * Ordering: Sort components by minimum row index descending (bottom-most first), then concatenate their subgrids side-by-side without separators, resulting in a wide 5-row grid.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming must preserve core shapes (e.g., don't over-trim if condition not met exactly); filling is column-wise and iterative but limited to 1's adjacent to other 1's; components might overlap or be adjacent, but extraction treats them separately; output rows must match expected exactly, including bg placements; test inputs may have more complex layouts with multiple objects vertically stacked or offset.
 * General: Grids can vary in size; empty inputs return 5 empty rows; no rotation or vertical concatenation—always horizontal after sorting; numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 represent colors or labels, with 1 often being fillable "ink" and higher numbers structural.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * `trim_left_protrusions`: Condition (full height non-bg, <=3 types including 4) is too specific/fragile; over-trims or under-trims shapes, leading to extra 1's in training 1 (e.g., fails to remove protrusions properly, leaving artifacts).
 * `trim_right_protrusions`: Similar issue (full/sparse height, <=2 types including 5); condition allows num_non<=1 which is too loose, causing misalignment in training 2 (e.g., doesn't trim correctly, resulting in shifted structures).
 * `fill_sparse_ones`: Iterative filling of 1's based on adjacent columns is conceptually good but broken in scope—only checks immediate left/right columns and ±1 rows, but doesn't propagate fully or handle non-1 adjacents; causes over-filling in training 1 (e.g., adds 1's where bg expected) and under-filling in training 2.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies large components (>=10 cells) and extracts bounding subgrids, which is core to isolating objects (worked in concept but size threshold may be off for some cases).
 * Sorting by min_r descending (bottom-first) and horizontal concatenation is a good high-level structure, but fails in practice due to poor trimming/filling, leading to incorrect widths and placements.
 * Training 1: Generated has extra 1's in rows 1 and 3 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 8,8), making shapes wider/uncleaned; top/bottom rows match expected (bg borders preserved), but middle rows mismatch due to over-trimming or failed filling (unknown exact cause, but likely protrusion trim didn't remove left artifacts properly).
 * Training 2: Generated is severely mismatched—rows have wrong lengths/orders (e.g., row 0 starts with [4,6,6,6,...] but expected [4,4,4,...] with different concatenation); structures like the 6-block and 1/3/4 shapes are jumbled/shifted, likely from incorrect component ordering or over-aggressive trimming that altered bounding boxes; left-side elements (1's,4's) are misplaced compared to expected centered layout.
 * `trim_outer_bg` and `pad_to_5_rows` seem to work partially (preserve heights), but overall pipeline breaks on subtleties like exact protrusion detection.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction but misses precise cleaning rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a 5x34 grid with dense concatenation of what seem like multiple objects (e.g., 3/4/6/7/8/9 regions), but lacks the clean isolation seen in training expecteds—e.g., rows have irregular bg placements (many 8's scattered) and shapes like a 3-block with 1's/6's appear fused or untrimmed, unlike training's separated, trimmed symbols.
 * Missing proper trimming: e.g., row 2 has [4,4,1,4,4,3,...] which looks like unremoved protrusions (1 in middle of 4's), and right side has clustered 6/1/7/8/3/9 without clear boundaries, suggesting failed left/right protrusion removal.
 * Over-filling or no filling: Sparse 1's (e.g., in row 0 positions 5-6:1,6,1) aren't propagated cleanly, leading to jagged edges; concatenation order may be wrong (bottom-first but test has top-heavy look).
 * Doesn't match expected puzzle logic: If test has multiple vertical objects (e.g., 3/4 tower left, 6/7/8/9 right), output should separate them into distinct 5-row blocks horizontally, but here they're mushed with extra widths; bg=3? (common value), but handling seems inconsistent.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large connected components of non-background cells (objects or blobs), extracting minimal bounding subgrids for each, trimming extraneous background and protrusion columns based on specific rules, padding them to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenating these subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output, sorted by the topmost row position of each component (descending order to prioritize higher components).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all components must exclude bg cells and only consider 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right).
 * Only include components with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are omitted entirely.
 * After bounding box extraction, trim outer pure-bg columns from left/right, but do not trim rows (vertical trimming is not applied).
 * Trim "protrusions" iteratively from left/right: remove a column if its non-bg cells have <=2 unique values including 4 or 5, or exactly 1 unique value of 8 (this seems to target thin, simple extensions like lines or bars, but may over-trim complex shapes).
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering the subgrid if shorter or truncating from center if longer (though truncation is rare given component sizes).
 * Sort components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then concatenate their 5-row subgrids side-by-side into the output; no vertical stacking or other arrangements.
 * Output must be exactly 5 rows, with varying column lengths per row only if subgrids have different widths, but in practice, they should align as a flat concatenation.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are value-specific (e.g., 4/5/8 trigger removal), suggesting the grid uses numbered cells representing colors/shapes, and protrusions are often uniform or low-variety "noise" like borders or antennas.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are separated by bg; bounding boxes may include internal bg holes, which are preserved (no infilling).
 * Easy to miss: Sorting is by -minr (top-first), not by left position or size; if multiple top-aligned, order is unstable (as-is from discovery).
 * Empty input or no large components should return 5 empty rows.
 * Potential over-trimming: The protrusion rule may remove valid parts of objects if they match the criteria (e.g., a column with only 4's and 5's gets trimmed even if integral to the shape).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only provided) attempt; it correctly identifies large components and extracts/concatenates them, but fails on trimming and arrangement.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 9's in top/bottom rows (e.g., [6,8,9,9,8,...] vs expected [6,8,9,8,8,...] with single 9), and inner structure mismatches (e.g., row2 has 4,4 vs expected 4,1; overall shape bloated on left with duplicated 1's and 8's), likely due to over-retention of bg or protrusion columns; right side (2's/3's) is close but shifted.
 * Train 1: Sorting by -minr works in concept, but concatenation includes untrimmed parts, leading to wider-than-expected output (13 cols vs expected 12).
 * Train 2: Generated a symmetric but incorrect layout with 6's on left/top and duplicated patterns (e.g., row0 starts [6,6,6,4,...] vs expected [4,4,4,...] with 6's later); right side has 1's/3's mismatched (e.g., row1 ends [...,3,3,1] vs expected [...,3,3,1] but overall order wrong, with 20+ cols vs expected 22); suggests wrong component discovery or trimming removed too much/too little, flipping left/right elements.
 * Train 2: Protrusion trimming likely failed to remove intended bars (e.g., 6's or 8's), causing misaligned concatenation; expected has longer, more spread-out components including 8's not in generated.
 * Over-trimming in protrusions: Rule catches simple columns (e.g., all 8's or 4/5 mixes) but may spare complex ones incorrectly, or vice versa; in train1, it didn't trim enough to remove extra 9's.
 * find_large_components is helpful and likely correct (size threshold and connectivity match needs), but may include bg-adjacent noise if threshold too low.
 * trim_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Its criteria (ls<=2 with 4/5, or single 8) are too narrow/specific, missing other protrusion types (e.g., 6's, 9's, or 1/2/3 mixes in examples); it under-trims in train1 (extra 9's) and over-trims or misapplies in train2 (wrong symmetry); do not use without generalization (e.g., expand to more values or count non-bg density).
 * get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows are helpful and seem correct, preserving shapes and standardizing height.
 * trim_outer_bg is helpful but insufficient alone; needs better protrusion handling.
 * Overall program: Concatenation logic is close (horizontal, top-sorted), but fails due to upstream trimming errors; empty handling is good.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a 5-row grid with inconsistent widths (row0: 26 elements, row1: 26, row2: 26, row3: 26, row4: 26, but visually misaligned in listing), featuring clustered numbers like multiple 3's/8's on left/middle and 1's/6's/7's/9's scattered, suggesting multiple components were found and concatenated but poorly trimmed (e.g., excess 8's as bg intrusions, untrimmed protrusions like vertical 3's or 6's).
 * Compared to training failures, it inherits issues: Likely over-retention of bg/protrusions (e.g., lines of 8's or 3's that should be trimmed), wrong sorting (components appear jumbled, not strictly top-first), and value mismatches (7's and 9's prominent, possibly untrimmed edges like in train1).
 * Does not make sense as a clean puzzle solution: Output has dense, asymmetric blobs (e.g., row4 ends with 1,1,1,3,3,3 but starts with 3,8,8,...), lacking the structured symmetry or separation seen in expected training outputs; probably includes small/noisy components or fails to isolate core shapes (e.g., the 7's might be protrusions not caught by trim rules).
 * To handle test: Need broader trimming (e.g., remove columns with <50% non-bg or specific patterns beyond 4/5/8), verify component count/order against expected (test seems to have 3-4 objects based on shifts at cols ~6,12,20), and ensure no internal bg inflation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing symbols or colors on a background (bg, often 0 or similar), where the goal is to identify large connected non-background components (objects/symbols), extract and clean them via bounding boxes, trim extraneous backgrounds and protrusions based on shape heuristics, apply special framing rules for incomplete shapes, pad them to exactly 5 rows, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered by their vertical position in the original grid (top-to-bottom or similar).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "large" components as connected (4-directional adjacency) groups of non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller ones are ignored as noise.
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg from bg.
 * Extraction uses bounding subgrids, but must handle irregular shapes by trimming outer pure-bg columns (left/right/top/bottom implicitly via bounding).
 * Trimming protrusions is heuristic and shape-specific: left-side checks column diversity (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 triggers trim; single 1 after pending; single 8 resets pending); right-side similar but with 5/3/8 patterns— these seem tailored to specific symbol "artifacts" like stems or bars, but are brittle and miss general cases.
 * Special framing rule only for exactly 5-high subgrids: if uniform left column (non-bg), and right column has matching top/bot (non-bg, !=left), with a single 4 in rows 1-3 on right, then extend right by 3 columns of bg and place 1s in the "k" row— this is a very narrow fix for one incomplete frame type, easy to miss or overapply.
 * Padding to 5 rows: center vertically with bg rows if <5, truncate center if >5; widths preserved but concatenated horizontally.
 * Ordering: sort by minimum row index of component (descending/reverse, so topmost first?), then extend each output row by appending the processed subgrid's row.
 * Subtleties: Components may overlap in projection but are processed separately; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if empty (all bg or []); handle empty grids gracefully; protrusion trims can loop and chain (e.g., pending state across iterations); no rotation/flipping; assumes grid is rectangular; potential for multiple components per "symbol" but code treats each >=10 separately.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming doesn't handle top/bottom protrusions explicitly (only left/right); special frame adds fixed 3 columns, which may not generalize; concatenation assumes all subgrids same height post-pad (5), but widths vary; bg padding must match subgrid width; component finding uses DFS/stack, which is fine but must mark visited to avoid overlap.
 * General: Puzzle likely renders "text" or "symbols" via these objects; failures often from over-trimming/under-trimming or wrong ordering, leading to shape distortions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Extracts connected components of non-bg cells (4-dir) with size >=10 using DFS/stack and visited matrix.
    # Useful for isolating objects; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Works well as core extraction step.
```

```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes tight bounding box subgrid for a component, slicing original grid.
    # Essential for isolating each object without extra bg.
```

```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or truncates to exactly 5 rows, centering with bg rows; preserves width.
    # Helpful for standardization, but note: if h>5, it crops center—may lose top/bot details if asymmetric.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Trims pure-bg columns from left/right (vertical strips).
    # Basic but useful; doesn't handle top/bottom explicitly (could be added).
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on left column diversity (e.g., <=3 uniq with 4; pending for 1; single 8).
    # Broken: over-trims or under-trims specific shapes, causing distortions (e.g., leaves artifacts in train1).
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar heuristic for right (with 5/3/8).
    # Broken: inconsistent with left, misses cases, leads to asymmetric shapes.
```

```python
def special_complete_frame(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Narrow rule to add 3 bg columns + 1s in one row for specific 5-high frame.
    # Unhelpful: too specific (only triggers on exact left uniform + right patterns with single 4); doesn't apply broadly and may add wrong elements.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, bounding/extracting them, basic bg trimming, and padding/concatenation framework.
 * What worked: Component detection and basic structure (e.g., outputs are always 5 rows; finds non-bg blobs >=10); ordering by min_row (reverse) seems to place top objects first; handles empty cases.
 * What didn't: Protrusion trims are flawed heuristics, leading to incomplete cleaning (e.g., leaves extra 8s or distorts shapes); special frame doesn't trigger or fix relevant cases; no top/bottom trimming, causing height issues pre-pad; concatenation works but with dirty subgrids, so overall output polluted.
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in rows 1/3—has [6,1,1,8,8,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,...], indicating failed left trim (left object not fully cleaned to 1s, left 8s as bg or protrusion); symmetric top/bot rows match, middle row2 correct, right parts ok—suggests partial trim success but missed inner details (unknown why exactly, perhaps pending state bug or wrong uniqueness check).
 * Train2: Generated is ~5x14 but wrong structure/content (e.g., starts with [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs expected much longer ~5x22 with different ordering/layout); likely missed multiple components or wrong bounding/trim (e.g., didn't extract separate left/center/right objects fully; protrusion rules over-trimmed or concatenated prematurely); expected has repeated 4s/1s patterns suggesting multiple padded symbols, but generated merges/distorts them.
 * Overall: Core extraction good, but cleaning/processing steps brittle—leads to shape errors; no handling for vertical protrusions or general symmetry enforcement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with irregular patterns (e.g., row0 has mixed 1/6/3/7/8; row2/3/4 show vertical stacks of 3/8/6/1/7/9), but it does not look correct—likely over-concatenated or under-trimmed multiple components without proper cleaning, resulting in a "smeared" look (e.g., long horizontal runs of same numbers suggest untrimmed bg or protrusions bleeding across symbols; vertical alignments like 3-8-3-3-3 in col0 imply stacked but uncleaned objects).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Without ground truth, but based on trains, it should be cleaner, separated symbols (e.g., distinct blocks of 1-9 patterns padded to 5-high, no excessive 8s as apparent bg leaks); here, it seems to have extracted ~4-5 components but failed trims (e.g., 8s in row1 col1-8 look like untrimmed right protrusion from a left symbol; 9s in row1/2 col20-22 may be a partial object). This doesn't make sense as a final "rendered" puzzle output—too noisy and asymmetric compared to train expecteds' structured, symmetric symbol rows; probably needs better left/right trim rules and top/bottom handling to isolate clean 5-high blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing shapes or blobs on a background, and the goal is to extract large connected components (non-background cells), process them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, handle special shape completions, pad to exactly 5 rows, sort them by their topmost row position (descending), and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid. The output represents an arranged view of cleaned-up shapes, likely for identification or matching in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only keep those with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for components; diagonals do not count.
 * Extract the minimal bounding subgrid for each component, then trim outer pure-background columns from all sides.
 * Trim left protrusions specifically: look for columns with full-height non-background where set includes 4 and <=3 unique values, or follow-up full-height {1} or sparse {1}; similar for right with 5 instead of 4; this seems to remove "antennae" or irregular extensions based on specific numbers like 4/5 (possibly denoting edges) and 1 (possibly a connector or filler).
 * Special handling for 5-row-high subgrids: if left column is uniform non-background C, right column has matching top/bottom D != C/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows on right, then append a copy of column 1 (second column) as new column 3 and a mostly-bg column 4 with 1 at the 4's row— this appears to "complete" an incomplete shape, but only if conditions match exactly.
 * Pad subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible; if over 5 rows, crop center 5.
 * Sort processed components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then horizontally concatenate their padded rows into the output; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming must preserve shape integrity—over-trimming can remove essential parts; special completion assumes exact 5-height and specific patterns, which may not always apply.
 * Output must match expected lengths and values exactly; mismatches often come from incorrect trimming (leaving extra bg or protrusions), wrong sorting/ordering of components, or failing to filter small components.
 * Background value varies per grid (always g[0][0]), and numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 likely represent colors, labels, or shape types that must be preserved.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming uses a "pending" state to chain trims (e.g., after detecting 4/5, allow subsequent {1} columns); without this, partial trims occur.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by top row, vertical alignment is implicit.
 * If subgrid width becomes 0 after trimming, skip it entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and last) submission shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding boxes, basic bg trimming, and padding/sorting logic.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS seems solid (finds blobs >=10); bounding subgrid extraction isolates shapes accurately; vertical padding to 5 rows standardizes output; sorting by min row descending and horizontal concat handles arrangement.
 * What didn't work: Trimming functions (outer_bg, left/right protrusions) are incomplete or buggy— in train 1, generated rows have extra elements (e.g., row 0: 14 elems vs expected 12, with extra 8's; row 1: extra 1,8,8 and misplaced 2's/3's); protrusions not fully removed, leaving bg or filler 1's/8's.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated includes extra 1's and 8's in middle (e.g., row1 has [6,1,1,1,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]—extra 1,8,8, and lengths differ by 2); row2 has extra 1,1,1,1,1 vs expected cleaner [6,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3]; symmetric rows duplicated incorrectly; unknown reason for extras, possibly over-retention in trimming or special_complete_shape adding wrong columns.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Severe—generated rows much longer (e.g., row0: 23 elems vs expected 22), with misplaced 6's/4's/1's at start ( [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs [4,4,4,4,...] ); components seem extracted but not trimmed/sorted right, leading to duplicated or shifted shapes (e.g., 5,3,5 patterns appear early but expected later); protrusions like left 4's/6's not handled, causing overlap or extras.
 * Special_complete_shape likely unhelpful—may be adding phantom columns in train 1 (extras around 8's/1's).
 * Overall, core extraction works, but processing (trimming/special) fails to clean shapes, leading to polluted outputs; no small components included (good), but large ones not refined properly.
 * Function trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but only does columns—may need row trimming for full cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as the program failed both training examples with similar trimming/processing errors (extras, length mismatches, misplaced values), suggesting it would mishandle test's complex grid similarly.
 * Issues: Rows have varying lengths (e.g., row0: 34 elems, but inconsistent patterns like clustered 3's/1's/6's/4's/7's/8's/9's suggest untrimmed protrusions or incomplete component isolation; e.g., repeated 3's and 8's look like retained bg or partial shapes.
 * Missing expected cleanliness: Expected output should have distinct, trimmed shapes concatenated without extras (e.g., no long runs of 8's/bg if trimmed right); here, dense 3's/8's/9's indicate over-retention, and values like 7/9 may be from unprocessed parts.
 * Does not make sense: Patterns like vertical 3's on left and scattered 1's/4's/6's suggest multiple components concatenated but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left columns have full-height 3's that might be protrusions per rules); special shapes not completed properly, leading to asymmetric or incomplete blobs; overall too noisy compared to cleaner expected trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected non-background components (objects or "blobs") must be extracted, trimmed to remove backgrounds and irregular protrusions, potentially modified with special rules (like completing frames), padded to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, sorted by the objects' original topmost row position in descending order (top-to-bottom priority).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (e.g., 6 in train1, 4 in train2 expected); all processing treats cells != bg as part of objects.
 * Only components with >=10 connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) are considered "large" and extracted; smaller ones are ignored.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes around components, then trims outer full-bg columns.
 * Trimming protrusions is asymmetric and rule-based: left side trims columns with <=3 non-bg cells containing 4 or 5, or full columns of 8; enters "pending" mode for follow-up {1,8}-only columns; right side similar but focused on 5 and 8, without the 4 condition.
 * Special rule: For 5-row subgrids, if left column is uniform non-bg color (except bg), and right has specific pattern (top/bottom matching non-bg, not equal to left color, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3), append 3 bg-padded cells with a 1 in the row matching the 4's position— this seems to "complete" an incomplete frame but is very narrow and may over-apply or miss.
 * Padding: Center-pad or crop to exactly 5 rows with bg; if >5 rows, crop from middle; if <5, symmetric bg rows top/bottom.
 * Final output: Sort extracted/padded subgrids by min_row descending (top objects first), concatenate rows horizontally; if no objects, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must preserve object integrity (e.g., don't remove core shapes); special frame only for exact 5-high cases and may add width unexpectedly; sorting ensures vertical order but assumes non-overlapping components; connected components must ignore bg strictly; potential for multiple objects per row or stacked vertically; outputs retain original colors (1-9 likely represent shapes/colors); easy to miss: protrusion rules are color-specific (e.g., 1,4,5,8) and stateful (pending flag), leading to over/under-trimming; bounding box may include extra bg if not trimmed fully; no vertical trimming mentioned, so heights vary before padding.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle asymmetric shapes (e.g., protrusions only on sides); verify component size threshold (10 may be too high/low for some); special rules might be over-generalized or buggy (e.g., applies when not needed); concatenation assumes fixed 5 rows but variable widths; test for overlapping components or bg enclaves inside objects (current flood-fill ignores inner bg holes).

    # Pads/crops subgrid to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering where possible.
    # Essential for uniform output height; handles varying original heights.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding subgrids, and applying basic trimming/padding/concatenation/sorting.
 * What worked: Component detection via flood-fill is solid (finds non-bg blobs >=10 cells); bounding extraction and outer bg trim work for isolating rough shapes; padding to 5 rows ensures output format; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftward correctly in principle; for train1, the overall structure (e.g., three objects concatenated) is right, and colors mostly match except specific trim failures.
 * What didn't work: Protrusion trimming is incomplete/buggy— in train1, left trim failed to remove a bg column inside the first object, leaving extra 8s instead of connecting 1s (generated row1/3: 1,1,8,... vs expected 1,1,1,...; specific diff: positions 3-4 in first object have 8 where 1 expected, suggesting missed inner bg strip); right trim similar issues; special_complete_frame didn't trigger or apply correctly (no added elements visible, but may not have been needed); for train2, entire output is wrong—generated has wrong widths/heights, misplaced colors (e.g., long 4/6 runs at edges, but expected has reoriented/trimmed objects with different concatenation order/positions like 1,2,1 in row2 vs generated 3,5,6); unknown why train2 objects weren't isolated cleanly (possibly over-trimming or wrong component detection, e.g., merged separate blobs); component size threshold (10) may exclude/include wrongly; no vertical trimming, leading to uneven handling; special frame function is narrow (only 5-high, specific patterns) and likely unhelpful/broken for general cases (doesn't apply in examples but could add spurious width); trim_left/right_protrusions are overly complex/stateful and error-prone (pending logic fails on color sets like {4,5} not propagating correctly, leading to partial trims).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_large_components serves similar role and is essential; overall, attempt shows core extraction/sorting but fails on precise trimming, causing shape distortions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as a messy, wide concatenation (32 cols) with irregular patterns (e.g., scattered 1-9, long 3/8/6 runs, apparent merged blobs like vertical 3s and 4s), but lacks clean isolated objects—e.g., row0 has clustered 1,3,7,4,6 but no clear trimmed shapes; compared to train examples, expected outputs have symmetric/padded objects (e.g., train1 has clean 1/4/1 frames with 8 bg), while this has no obvious bg padding or frames, suggesting over-merging components or failed trims (e.g., untrimmed protrusions like the 7s/8s clusters); widths don't align with expected object isolation (too many cols for 3-4 objects); colors like repeated 3/6/8 indicate possible wrong bg detection or inclusion of small components; it does not match a mentally simulated correct output, which should have 3-5 trimmed 5-row objects (e.g., a left blob with 2/4/3, middle with 1/7/8 frame, right with 6/9/3) concatenated cleanly with bg spaces, but this seems to include extraneous connections (e.g., the 7 in row2/3 connects what should be separate).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to identify, extract, and standardize "objects" (connected non-background components of size >=10) from an input grid of integers (representing pixel colors/labels), then trim them according to specific protrusion and special rules, pad/crop to exactly 5 rows, and horizontally concatenate them in vertical order (top-to-bottom based on minimum row index) into a fixed 5-row output grid, preserving the background value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores or trims pure bg areas.
 * Connected components use 4-directional adjacency (up/down/left/right); only include cells != bg; must be size >=10 to qualify as an "object".
 * Bounding subgrid extracts the minimal rectangle around a component, but does not initially trim top/bottom (only left/right outer bg columns in trim_outer_bg).
 * Trimming is asymmetric and rule-based: trim_outer_bg removes full left/right columns of bg; trim_left_protrusions uses complex heuristics (e.g., column sets with <=3 types including 4, or "pending" counts of 1's, or single 8) to remove left "protrusions" iteratively; trim_right_protrusions is simpler (e.g., <=2 types including 5, or single 8).
 * apply_special is a niche rule: only for exactly 5-row subgrids with uniform non-bg left column L, right column with matching top/bottom !=bg !=L, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3 of right column; appends two new columns with a single 1 in the row matching the 4's position, rest bg— this seems to "fill" or "correct" specific shapes like incomplete letters/symbols.
 * Padding/cropping to 5 rows: if <5 rows, center-pad with bg rows (top/bottom); if >5, crop to middle 5 rows (not top or bottom aligned); no horizontal padding mentioned, but output is concatenated directly.
 * Output ordering: Sort objects by descending min_row (topmost first), then extend each output row by appending the corresponding row from each processed object horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Trimming rules are heuristic and color-specific (e.g., favoring 1,4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle encodes symbols/letters where certain numbers represent strokes (e.g., 1 for lines, 4/5/8 for curves/hooks); over-trimming can remove valid parts (e.g., turning 1's into 8's/bg); under-trimming leaves protrusions; special rule only triggers on exact 5-high; no rotation/reflection; empty input yields 5 empty rows; components may overlap in horizontal space but are processed independently; output lengths vary based on object widths post-trimming.
 * Easy-to-miss: Top/bottom trimming is absent in current code (only left/right), leading to untrimmed vertical bg; pending_count in left trim is a stateful counter for sequences of 1's, but resets unclearly; right trim lacks pending logic; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftmost, but if min_r ties, order is arbitrary (not specified); generated outputs show length mismatches, indicating width calculation errors post-trimming.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction and horizontal concatenation but fails on trimming and special rules.
 * find_large_components works well (correctly identifies qualifying objects in train1, as shapes are mostly preserved).
 * trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but incomplete (only handles left/right columns, misses top/bottom full bg rows, leading to potential vertical artifacts).
 * trim_left_protrusions is over-aggressive or miscalibrated: in train1, it incorrectly trims columns containing 1's (replacing them with 8/bg), e.g., row1/4 have 8 where expected 1 (missing third 1 in left object); pending_count logic for 1's seems buggy (resets to non_bg.count(1) but decrements without clear init/reset per object).
 * trim_right_protrusions underperforms in train2: fails to align or trim right-side objects properly, resulting in mismatched widths/positions (e.g., generated has 21+ cols per row vs expected 22, with 4's and 6's shifted left).
 * apply_special did not trigger in train1 (expected no change, but trimming issue masked it); unclear if it fired in train2, but output suggests special "filling" (e.g., extra 1's) was missed.
 * pad_to_5_rows works for vertical standardization but inherits trimming errors; in train2, middle-cropping >5 row objects may have cut key parts.
 * Overall in train1: Left object trimming wrong (generated row1: [6,1,1,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,...]; same for row4; row2/3 correct), right objects intact; lengths match but content differs by one column of 8->1.
 * Overall in train2: Major misalignment—generated starts with left-heavy 4/6/1 blocks out of order (e.g., row1 has [4,6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1] vs expected [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1]); objects concatenated wrong (e.g., 5/3/6 blocks shifted, missing 8's in expected right); lengths similar but positions/contents jumbled, suggesting sort or bounding error.
 * Sorting by -min_r works directionally but may fail on tied min_r or if min_r calc ignores trims.
 * No top/bottom trim function, leading to potential unhandled vertical protrusions (unobserved in trains but likely in test).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It's a 5x27 grid (very wide), with jumbled, asymmetric shapes (e.g., row0 has scattered 3/1/6/7/8/9, row2 has dense 3/8/1/7/6/9 blocks) that don't form coherent "symbols" like in trains (e.g., no clear letter-like clusters post-trim); lengths are inconsistent across rows? No, all 27, but visually messy with repeating 3/8 patterns suggesting under-trimmed protrusions or wrong component merging.
 * Compared to trains, it over-concatenates (27 cols vs train1's 12, train2's ~22), implying too many/large objects extracted or widths not trimmed (e.g., long horizontal 3/8 runs in row1/4 look like untrimmed bg-adjacent lines).
 * Missing expected "clean" separation: e.g., row2 has [4,3,8,3,...] starting with 4 (possibly a special case), but no obvious padding or filling; likely trimming failed (left/right rules didn't handle 3/6/7/9 mixes), and ordering placed bottom objects left (if min_r sort inverted).
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution—appears raw/unprocessed grid dump rather than standardized 5-row symbols; probably extracts extra small components or skips size check; unknown why so many 3/8/9 but no 2/4/5 balance like trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-processing puzzle where large non-background connected components (representing "objects" or shapes) are extracted from an input grid, normalized through bounding, trimming protrusions and backgrounds, optional special completions for specific patterns, and padding to exactly 5 rows, then concatenated horizontally in top-to-bottom order to form a final 5-row output grid. The goal is to clean and arrange these objects to match an expected composite image, likely for a rebus or shape-based riddle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify background as the value at g[0][0] and only process components of size >=10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for flood-fill to find components; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.
 * Bounding subgrid must tightly crop around the component's min/max rows/cols, but subsequent trims handle outer pure-bg columns.
 * Trimming outer bg removes full columns of bg on left/right, but only after bounding; if trimming empties the subgrid, handle gracefully (e.g., return empty rows).
 * Left protrusion trim: Iteratively remove leftmost column if non-bg cells are few (<=3 unique values including 4) or single value 1; this targets irregular "stubs" without removing core shape.
 * Right protrusion trim: Similar to left but checks for 5 in non-bg or single 1; asymmetric conditions suggest puzzle shapes have direction-specific irregularities (e.g., 4 on left, 5 on right as markers).
 * Special complete: Only for exactly 5-row subgrids; checks uniform non-bg left column (L), uniform top/bottom right column (R != bg, !=L), exactly one 4 in middle right positions (rows 1-3), then appends duplicated penultimate column, followed by two columns with 1 at the 4's row position and bg elsewhere—this seems to "fill" or symmetrize specific incomplete shapes like letters or symbols.
 * Padding: Center to 5 rows with bg if <5 (symmetric top/bottom), or crop center 5 if >5; preserves width per row.
 * Sorting: Process components by min row descending (top-first), concatenate by extending each output row with the processed sub-row; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Assumes all objects fit in 5 rows post-pad; special complete adds width (duplicates +2 cols), which may be key for train2 mismatch; protrusion trims are iterative but stop at w<=1; non-bg uniqueness checks (sets) ignore bg but count only non-bg variety.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5 empty rows; components touching edge may need no extra bg trim; multiple components per "level" aren't handled (all concatenated flatly, but sorting by minr groups vertically).
 * Potential misses: Over-trimming core shape (e.g., if protrusion conditions hit main body); special complete not triggering when it should (e.g., row count exactly 5 pre-pad); concatenation order assumes no overlaps, but visual alignment might require spacing (not implemented).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core component extraction, bounding, basic trimming, and concatenation work for simple cases.
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output is a near-mirror symmetric 5x21 grid with repeated 4/6 blocks on sides, internal 1/3/5/8 patterns, but lacks the expected framing 1's on left/right edges, has mismatched internal placements (e.g., 2 and 3's shifted, extra 8's), and shorter widths per row (21 vs expected 22); top/bottom rows identical in generated but expected has extended 1's.
 * What worked: Large component detection (>=10) and vertical sorting by minr correctly isolated objects; padding to 5 rows preserved shapes in train1.
 * What didn't: For train2, protrusion trims likely over-removed or misapplied (e.g., conditions hit core instead of stubs, removing necessary 1's for framing); special_complete probably didn't trigger or added incorrectly, leading to asymmetric/missing fills (expected has more 1's and structured 3/4/5 blocks); concatenation extended rows unevenly, causing width mismatch.
 * trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but brittle—conditions (e.g., 4/5 presence) may false-positive on complex shapes; unhelpful if shapes have >3 unique non-bg in protrusions.
 * special_complete is key for train2-like cases but overly restrictive (e.g., requires exact uniform left/right, single middle 4); didn't activate properly, missing the expected "completion" of partial symbols.
 * Overall program structure (process -> sort -> concat) is solid but fails on subtleties like exact trim conditions and special patterns, leading to distorted objects in composite.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with dense, irregular patterns (e.g., row0: 3,6,1,3's then 7,4,8,6's; heavy 3/8/6/9 clusters, some 1/7/4 accents), but it looks incorrect—appears over-trimmed or uncompleted, with jagged edges (e.g., varying densities of 3's and 8's suggest untrimmed protrusions or missed special fills) and no clear framing/separation between potential objects, unlike expected structured composites in train2.
 * Doesn't make sense visually: Lacks symmetry or clean shapes (e.g., row2 has isolated 4,8,3 then 7,3,6's; row4 has long 8's then 1,3's), probably from failing to trim properly (e.g., left/right conditions not catching 9's or 7's as protrusions) or special_complete not applying to 5-row objects, resulting in concatenated mess instead of normalized symbols.
 * Compared to train2 failure, similar issues: Missing expected 1-framing and block alignments; widths consistent (25 cols) but content mismatched (e.g., no evident top/bottom mirroring or 4/5 completions); to fix, need broader trim conditions (e.g., include 7/9 in checks) and debug special_complete triggers for test's denser grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:17:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected components (non-background cells) are extracted from an input grid, trimmed and modified according to specific rules to form subgrids, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their bottom-most position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and background (bg) elements. The goal is to isolate and refine "objects" or "shapes" in the grid to match expected clean, compact representations without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0], and components are 4-way connected groups of non-bg cells; only components with more than 10 cells are processed to avoid noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrid for each component, then trim full outer bg columns (left/right) that span all rows.
 * Trim left protrusions iteratively: remove leftmost column if it's all bg, or if non-bg cells have <=3 unique values including 4, or exactly one unique value which is 8; this targets irregular extensions on the left side.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with stricter conditions: remove rightmost column if all bg, or non-bg has <=2 unique including 5, or single 8; this handles asymmetric right-side irregularities.
 * Special completion applies only to 5-row subgrids with width >=3: if left column is all the same non-bg value L (no bg mixed in), and right column has matching top/bottom non-bg non-L values, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3, then duplicate the penultimate column, append two full bg columns, and place 1's in the new columns at the row index of the single 4—this seems to "complete" incomplete shapes like adding symmetric elements or holes.
 * Pad subgrids to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering if too tall (trim to 5) or adding symmetric bg rows if short; if after processing a subgrid is empty, skip it.
 * Sort processed subgrids by descending min row index (bottom-first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; if no valid components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming is iterative and column-specific, so order matters (trim outer bg first, then protrusions); special completion can widen the subgrid unexpectedly, potentially adding columns that need further consideration.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are processed separately; concatenation extends rows horizontally without vertical stacking.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion rules are asymmetric (left tolerates more variety with 4, right stricter with 5), and special completion requires exact conditions (e.g., no bg in left, exactly one 4 on right middle)—mismatches here can leave artifacts.
 * Handle empty/edge cases: zero rows/cols return empty 5x0; bg=8 in some examples but varies (e.g., 6 in train1).
 * Output must match expected length and values exactly; extra/duplicated cells indicate over-processing or failed trimming.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt processes multiple large components (>10 cells) separately, trims them, applies special rules, pads to 5 rows, sorts bottom-first, and concatenates horizontally, which captures the core structure but fails on training examples due to over-inclusion or failed trimming.
 * Train 1 (bg=6?): Generated output has 15 columns per row vs. expected 12; it duplicates middle sections (e.g., [1,8,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,...] appears symmetric but with extra 8's and 1's not in expected [1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]); likely protrusion trimming didn't remove enough, or special completion misapplied, leaving artifacts like extra 8's around the 9 and in the middle blob.
 * Train 1 also shows top/bottom rows with extra 8's after the 9 (e.g., generated [6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] vs. expected [6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]), suggesting outer trim or padding failed to compact.
 * Train 2 (bg=4?): Generated has 21 columns vs. expected 22, but mismatched positions (e.g., generated row 0 starts [4,6,6,6,4,...] and includes misplaced 1's/3's/5's early, while expected shifts elements rightward with 4's filling left and 8's in specific spots); concatenation order or component bounding seems wrong, as it didn't align the 6's and 3's properly, and protrusion rules may have over-trimmed right side (missing some 8's).
 * Train 2 generated symmetric but bloated rows (e.g., row 2 has [3,5,3,6,6,1,2,1,3,3,...] vs. expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] starting later), indicating multiple components concatenated out of order or without proper left-trim for the key shape.
 * Overall, what worked: Component detection and basic bounding/padding seem functional (outputs are 5 rows, non-empty for valid inputs); sorting by minr descending places bottom objects first.
 * What didn't: Trimming protrusions is too aggressive or condition-mismatched (e.g., left trim removes too much variety, failing on sets without 4); special completion likely not triggering correctly (no evidence of added 1's in outputs); multi-component handling concatenates extras instead of selecting/isolating the main object(s); no vertical trimming beyond padding, so tall components may bloat.
 * The main program function is helpful as a skeleton but needs refined conditions in trims and better component filtering (e.g., perhaps merge overlapping or select only the largest).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all provided (find_components, bounding, trims, special, pad) are relevant, though trim conditions are buggy/subtly wrong for these cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (5 rows, ~27 columns each) does not look correct; it appears as a single bloated concatenation without clear object separation (e.g., row 0 mixes 3's,1's,6's,7's,8's irregularly like [3,1,6,1,3,3,3,1,7,1,4,1,7,8,6,6,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,6,6], suggesting multiple untrimmed components smashed together without proper bounding or protrusion removal.
 * It lacks compactness—expected should be shorter, cleaner subgrids (e.g., trimmed to remove bg=3? protrusions, with special completion if applicable), but this has repeating 3's/8's/6's that look like unprocessed edges or failed trims (e.g., long runs of 3's on right in row 0, mismatched with row 4's 8's/1's/3's).
 * No obvious special completion effects (e.g., no added 1's in bg columns), and the irregularity (e.g., row 2 has isolated 9's and 7's not aligned across rows) suggests the program over-concatenated small/large components or skipped size filter inconsistently; it doesn't resemble a refined puzzle output and likely fails if expected is a simple 5x12-15 grid like training.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:17:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing symbols or colors on a background (bg, often 0 or similar), where the goal is to identify large connected non-background components (objects/symbols), extract and clean them via bounding boxes, trim extraneous backgrounds and protrusions based on shape heuristics, apply special framing rules for incomplete shapes, pad them to exactly 5 rows, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered by their vertical position in the original grid (top-to-bottom or similar).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "large" components as connected (4-directional adjacency) groups of non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller ones are ignored as noise.
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg from bg.
 * Extraction uses bounding subgrids, but must handle irregular shapes by trimming outer pure-bg columns (left/right/top/bottom implicitly via bounding).
 * Trimming protrusions is heuristic and shape-specific: left-side checks column diversity (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 triggers trim; single 1 after pending; single 8 resets pending); right-side similar but with 5/3/8 patterns— these seem tailored to specific symbol "artifacts" like stems or bars, but are brittle and miss general cases.
 * Special framing rule only for exactly 5-high subgrids: if uniform left column (non-bg), and right column has matching top/bot (non-bg, !=left), with a single 4 in rows 1-3 on right, then extend right by 3 columns of bg and place 1s in the "k" row— this is a very narrow fix for one incomplete frame type, easy to miss or overapply.
 * Padding to 5 rows: center vertically with bg rows if <5, truncate center if >5; widths preserved but concatenated horizontally.
 * Ordering: sort by minimum row index of component (descending/reverse, so topmost first?), then extend each output row by appending the processed subgrid's row.
 * Subtleties: Components may overlap in projection but are processed separately; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if empty (all bg or []); handle empty grids gracefully; protrusion trims can loop and chain (e.g., pending state across iterations); no rotation/flipping; assumes grid is rectangular; potential for multiple components per "symbol" but code treats each >=10 separately.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming doesn't handle top/bottom protrusions explicitly (only left/right); special frame adds fixed 3 columns, which may not generalize; concatenation assumes all subgrids same height post-pad (5), but widths vary; bg padding must match subgrid width; component finding uses DFS/stack, which is fine but must mark visited to avoid overlap.
 * General: Puzzle likely renders "text" or "symbols" via these objects; failures often from over-trimming/under-trimming or wrong ordering, leading to shape distortions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Extracts connected components of non-bg cells (4-dir) with size >=10 using DFS/stack and visited matrix.
    # Useful for isolating objects; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Works well as core extraction step.
```

```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes tight bounding box subgrid for a component, slicing original grid.
    # Essential for isolating each object without extra bg.
```

```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or truncates to exactly 5 rows, centering with bg rows; preserves width.
    # Helpful for standardization, but note: if h>5, it crops center—may lose top/bot details if asymmetric.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Trims pure-bg columns from left/right (vertical strips).
    # Basic but useful; doesn't handle top/bottom explicitly (could be added).
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on left column diversity (e.g., <=3 uniq with 4; pending for 1; single 8).
    # Broken: over-trims or under-trims specific shapes, causing distortions (e.g., leaves artifacts in train1).
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar heuristic for right (with 5/3/8).
    # Broken: inconsistent with left, misses cases, leads to asymmetric shapes.
```

```python
def special_complete_frame(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Narrow rule to add 3 bg columns + 1s in one row for specific 5-high frame.
    # Unhelpful: too specific (only triggers on exact left uniform + right patterns with single 4); doesn't apply broadly and may add wrong elements.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, bounding/extracting them, basic bg trimming, and padding/concatenation framework.
 * What worked: Component detection and basic structure (e.g., outputs are always 5 rows; finds non-bg blobs >=10); ordering by min_row (reverse) seems to place top objects first; handles empty cases.
 * What didn't: Protrusion trims are flawed heuristics, leading to incomplete cleaning (e.g., leaves extra 8s or distorts shapes); special frame doesn't trigger or fix relevant cases; no top/bottom trimming, causing height issues pre-pad; concatenation works but with dirty subgrids, so overall output polluted.
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in rows 1/3—has [6,1,1,8,8,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,...], indicating failed left trim (left object not fully cleaned to 1s, left 8s as bg or protrusion); symmetric top/bot rows match, middle row2 correct, right parts ok—suggests partial trim success but missed inner details (unknown why exactly, perhaps pending state bug or wrong uniqueness check).
 * Train2: Generated is ~5x14 but wrong structure/content (e.g., starts with [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs expected much longer ~5x22 with different ordering/layout); likely missed multiple components or wrong bounding/trim (e.g., didn't extract separate left/center/right objects fully; protrusion rules over-trimmed or concatenated prematurely); expected has repeated 4s/1s patterns suggesting multiple padded symbols, but generated merges/distorts them.
 * Overall: Core extraction good, but cleaning/processing steps brittle—leads to shape errors; no handling for vertical protrusions or general symmetry enforcement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with irregular patterns (e.g., row0 has mixed 1/6/3/7/8; row2/3/4 show vertical stacks of 3/8/6/1/7/9), but it does not look correct—likely over-concatenated or under-trimmed multiple components without proper cleaning, resulting in a "smeared" look (e.g., long horizontal runs of same numbers suggest untrimmed bg or protrusions bleeding across symbols; vertical alignments like 3-8-3-3-3 in col0 imply stacked but uncleaned objects).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Without ground truth, but based on trains, it should be cleaner, separated symbols (e.g., distinct blocks of 1-9 patterns padded to 5-high, no excessive 8s as apparent bg leaks); here, it seems to have extracted ~4-5 components but failed trims (e.g., 8s in row1 col1-8 look like untrimmed right protrusion from a left symbol; 9s in row1/2 col20-22 may be a partial object). This doesn't make sense as a final "rendered" puzzle output—too noisy and asymmetric compared to train expecteds' structured, symmetric symbol rows; probably needs better left/right trim rules and top/bottom handling to isolate clean 5-high blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing shapes or blobs on a background, and the goal is to extract large connected components (non-background cells), process them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, handle special shape completions, pad to exactly 5 rows, sort them by their topmost row position (descending), and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid. The output represents an arranged view of cleaned-up shapes, likely for identification or matching in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only keep those with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for components; diagonals do not count.
 * Extract the minimal bounding subgrid for each component, then trim outer pure-background columns from all sides.
 * Trim left protrusions specifically: look for columns with full-height non-background where set includes 4 and <=3 unique values, or follow-up full-height {1} or sparse {1}; similar for right with 5 instead of 4; this seems to remove "antennae" or irregular extensions based on specific numbers like 4/5 (possibly denoting edges) and 1 (possibly a connector or filler).
 * Special handling for 5-row-high subgrids: if left column is uniform non-background C, right column has matching top/bottom D != C/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows on right, then append a copy of column 1 (second column) as new column 3 and a mostly-bg column 4 with 1 at the 4's row— this appears to "complete" an incomplete shape, but only if conditions match exactly.
 * Pad subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible; if over 5 rows, crop center 5.
 * Sort processed components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then horizontally concatenate their padded rows into the output; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming must preserve shape integrity—over-trimming can remove essential parts; special completion assumes exact 5-height and specific patterns, which may not always apply.
 * Output must match expected lengths and values exactly; mismatches often come from incorrect trimming (leaving extra bg or protrusions), wrong sorting/ordering of components, or failing to filter small components.
 * Background value varies per grid (always g[0][0]), and numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 likely represent colors, labels, or shape types that must be preserved.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming uses a "pending" state to chain trims (e.g., after detecting 4/5, allow subsequent {1} columns); without this, partial trims occur.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by top row, vertical alignment is implicit.
 * If subgrid width becomes 0 after trimming, skip it entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and last) submission shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding boxes, basic bg trimming, and padding/sorting logic.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS seems solid (finds blobs >=10); bounding subgrid extraction isolates shapes accurately; vertical padding to 5 rows standardizes output; sorting by min row descending and horizontal concat handles arrangement.
 * What didn't work: Trimming functions (outer_bg, left/right protrusions) are incomplete or buggy— in train 1, generated rows have extra elements (e.g., row 0: 14 elems vs expected 12, with extra 8's; row 1: extra 1,8,8 and misplaced 2's/3's); protrusions not fully removed, leaving bg or filler 1's/8's.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated includes extra 1's and 8's in middle (e.g., row1 has [6,1,1,1,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]—extra 1,8,8, and lengths differ by 2); row2 has extra 1,1,1,1,1 vs expected cleaner [6,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3]; symmetric rows duplicated incorrectly; unknown reason for extras, possibly over-retention in trimming or special_complete_shape adding wrong columns.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Severe—generated rows much longer (e.g., row0: 23 elems vs expected 22), with misplaced 6's/4's/1's at start ( [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs [4,4,4,4,...] ); components seem extracted but not trimmed/sorted right, leading to duplicated or shifted shapes (e.g., 5,3,5 patterns appear early but expected later); protrusions like left 4's/6's not handled, causing overlap or extras.
 * Special_complete_shape likely unhelpful—may be adding phantom columns in train 1 (extras around 8's/1's).
 * Overall, core extraction works, but processing (trimming/special) fails to clean shapes, leading to polluted outputs; no small components included (good), but large ones not refined properly.
 * Function trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but only does columns—may need row trimming for full cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as the program failed both training examples with similar trimming/processing errors (extras, length mismatches, misplaced values), suggesting it would mishandle test's complex grid similarly.
 * Issues: Rows have varying lengths (e.g., row0: 34 elems, but inconsistent patterns like clustered 3's/1's/6's/4's/7's/8's/9's suggest untrimmed protrusions or incomplete component isolation; e.g., repeated 3's and 8's look like retained bg or partial shapes.
 * Missing expected cleanliness: Expected output should have distinct, trimmed shapes concatenated without extras (e.g., no long runs of 8's/bg if trimmed right); here, dense 3's/8's/9's indicate over-retention, and values like 7/9 may be from unprocessed parts.
 * Does not make sense: Patterns like vertical 3's on left and scattered 1's/4's/6's suggest multiple components concatenated but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left columns have full-height 3's that might be protrusions per rules); special shapes not completed properly, leading to asymmetric or incomplete blobs; overall too noisy compared to cleaner expected trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected non-background components (objects or "blobs") must be extracted, trimmed to remove backgrounds and irregular protrusions, potentially modified with special rules (like completing frames), padded to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, sorted by the objects' original topmost row position in descending order (top-to-bottom priority).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (e.g., 6 in train1, 4 in train2 expected); all processing treats cells != bg as part of objects.
 * Only components with >=10 connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) are considered "large" and extracted; smaller ones are ignored.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes around components, then trims outer full-bg columns.
 * Trimming protrusions is asymmetric and rule-based: left side trims columns with <=3 non-bg cells containing 4 or 5, or full columns of 8; enters "pending" mode for follow-up {1,8}-only columns; right side similar but focused on 5 and 8, without the 4 condition.
 * Special rule: For 5-row subgrids, if left column is uniform non-bg color (except bg), and right has specific pattern (top/bottom matching non-bg, not equal to left color, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3), append 3 bg-padded cells with a 1 in the row matching the 4's position— this seems to "complete" an incomplete frame but is very narrow and may over-apply or miss.
 * Padding: Center-pad or crop to exactly 5 rows with bg; if >5 rows, crop from middle; if <5, symmetric bg rows top/bottom.
 * Final output: Sort extracted/padded subgrids by min_row descending (top objects first), concatenate rows horizontally; if no objects, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must preserve object integrity (e.g., don't remove core shapes); special frame only for exact 5-high cases and may add width unexpectedly; sorting ensures vertical order but assumes non-overlapping components; connected components must ignore bg strictly; potential for multiple objects per row or stacked vertically; outputs retain original colors (1-9 likely represent shapes/colors); easy to miss: protrusion rules are color-specific (e.g., 1,4,5,8) and stateful (pending flag), leading to over/under-trimming; bounding box may include extra bg if not trimmed fully; no vertical trimming mentioned, so heights vary before padding.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle asymmetric shapes (e.g., protrusions only on sides); verify component size threshold (10 may be too high/low for some); special rules might be over-generalized or buggy (e.g., applies when not needed); concatenation assumes fixed 5 rows but variable widths; test for overlapping components or bg enclaves inside objects (current flood-fill ignores inner bg holes).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Flood-fill to find connected components >=10 cells, ignoring bg; uses DFS stack.

    # Note: Assumes 4-connectivity; visited matrix prevents revisits.

    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid bounding the component cells.
    # Helpful as starting point for per-object processing; includes some bg edges.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns from subgrid.

```

```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads/crops subgrid to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering where possible.
    # Essential for uniform output height; handles varying original heights.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding subgrids, and applying basic trimming/padding/concatenation/sorting.
 * What worked: Component detection via flood-fill is solid (finds non-bg blobs >=10 cells); bounding extraction and outer bg trim work for isolating rough shapes; padding to 5 rows ensures output format; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftward correctly in principle; for train1, the overall structure (e.g., three objects concatenated) is right, and colors mostly match except specific trim failures.
 * What didn't work: Protrusion trimming is incomplete/buggy— in train1, left trim failed to remove a bg column inside the first object, leaving extra 8s instead of connecting 1s (generated row1/3: 1,1,8,... vs expected 1,1,1,...; specific diff: positions 3-4 in first object have 8 where 1 expected, suggesting missed inner bg strip); right trim similar issues; special_complete_frame didn't trigger or apply correctly (no added elements visible, but may not have been needed); for train2, entire output is wrong—generated has wrong widths/heights, misplaced colors (e.g., long 4/6 runs at edges, but expected has reoriented/trimmed objects with different concatenation order/positions like 1,2,1 in row2 vs generated 3,5,6); unknown why train2 objects weren't isolated cleanly (possibly over-trimming or wrong component detection, e.g., merged separate blobs); component size threshold (10) may exclude/include wrongly; no vertical trimming, leading to uneven handling; special frame function is narrow (only 5-high, specific patterns) and likely unhelpful/broken for general cases (doesn't apply in examples but could add spurious width); trim_left/right_protrusions are overly complex/stateful and error-prone (pending logic fails on color sets like {4,5} not propagating correctly, leading to partial trims).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_large_components serves similar role and is essential; overall, attempt shows core extraction/sorting but fails on precise trimming, causing shape distortions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as a messy, wide concatenation (32 cols) with irregular patterns (e.g., scattered 1-9, long 3/8/6 runs, apparent merged blobs like vertical 3s and 4s), but lacks clean isolated objects—e.g., row0 has clustered 1,3,7,4,6 but no clear trimmed shapes; compared to train examples, expected outputs have symmetric/padded objects (e.g., train1 has clean 1/4/1 frames with 8 bg), while this has no obvious bg padding or frames, suggesting over-merging components or failed trims (e.g., untrimmed protrusions like the 7s/8s clusters); widths don't align with expected object isolation (too many cols for 3-4 objects); colors like repeated 3/6/8 indicate possible wrong bg detection or inclusion of small components; it does not match a mentally simulated correct output, which should have 3-5 trimmed 5-row objects (e.g., a left blob with 2/4/3, middle with 1/7/8 frame, right with 6/9/3) concatenated cleanly with bg spaces, but this seems to include extraneous connections (e.g., the 7 in row2/3 connects what should be separate).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to identify, extract, and standardize "objects" (connected non-background components of size >=10) from an input grid of integers (representing pixel colors/labels), then trim them according to specific protrusion and special rules, pad/crop to exactly 5 rows, and horizontally concatenate them in vertical order (top-to-bottom based on minimum row index) into a fixed 5-row output grid, preserving the background value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores or trims pure bg areas.
 * Connected components use 4-directional adjacency (up/down/left/right); only include cells != bg; must be size >=10 to qualify as an "object".
 * Bounding subgrid extracts the minimal rectangle around a component, but does not initially trim top/bottom (only left/right outer bg columns in trim_outer_bg).
 * Trimming is asymmetric and rule-based: trim_outer_bg removes full left/right columns of bg; trim_left_protrusions uses complex heuristics (e.g., column sets with <=3 types including 4, or "pending" counts of 1's, or single 8) to remove left "protrusions" iteratively; trim_right_protrusions is simpler (e.g., <=2 types including 5, or single 8).
 * apply_special is a niche rule: only for exactly 5-row subgrids with uniform non-bg left column L, right column with matching top/bottom !=bg !=L, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3 of right column; appends two new columns with a single 1 in the row matching the 4's position, rest bg— this seems to "fill" or "correct" specific shapes like incomplete letters/symbols.
 * Padding/cropping to 5 rows: if <5 rows, center-pad with bg rows (top/bottom); if >5, crop to middle 5 rows (not top or bottom aligned); no horizontal padding mentioned, but output is concatenated directly.
 * Output ordering: Sort objects by descending min_row (topmost first), then extend each output row by appending the corresponding row from each processed object horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Trimming rules are heuristic and color-specific (e.g., favoring 1,4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle encodes symbols/letters where certain numbers represent strokes (e.g., 1 for lines, 4/5/8 for curves/hooks); over-trimming can remove valid parts (e.g., turning 1's into 8's/bg); under-trimming leaves protrusions; special rule only triggers on exact 5-high; no rotation/reflection; empty input yields 5 empty rows; components may overlap in horizontal space but are processed independently; output lengths vary based on object widths post-trimming.
 * Easy-to-miss: Top/bottom trimming is absent in current code (only left/right), leading to untrimmed vertical bg; pending_count in left trim is a stateful counter for sequences of 1's, but resets unclearly; right trim lacks pending logic; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftmost, but if min_r ties, order is arbitrary (not specified); generated outputs show length mismatches, indicating width calculation errors post-trimming.

    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction and horizontal concatenation but fails on trimming and special rules.
 * find_large_components works well (correctly identifies qualifying objects in train1, as shapes are mostly preserved).
 * trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but incomplete (only handles left/right columns, misses top/bottom full bg rows, leading to potential vertical artifacts).
 * trim_left_protrusions is over-aggressive or miscalibrated: in train1, it incorrectly trims columns containing 1's (replacing them with 8/bg), e.g., row1/4 have 8 where expected 1 (missing third 1 in left object); pending_count logic for 1's seems buggy (resets to non_bg.count(1) but decrements without clear init/reset per object).
 * trim_right_protrusions underperforms in train2: fails to align or trim right-side objects properly, resulting in mismatched widths/positions (e.g., generated has 21+ cols per row vs expected 22, with 4's and 6's shifted left).
 * apply_special did not trigger in train1 (expected no change, but trimming issue masked it); unclear if it fired in train2, but output suggests special "filling" (e.g., extra 1's) was missed.
 * pad_to_5_rows works for vertical standardization but inherits trimming errors; in train2, middle-cropping >5 row objects may have cut key parts.
 * Overall in train1: Left object trimming wrong (generated row1: [6,1,1,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,...]; same for row4; row2/3 correct), right objects intact; lengths match but content differs by one column of 8->1.
 * Overall in train2: Major misalignment—generated starts with left-heavy 4/6/1 blocks out of order (e.g., row1 has [4,6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1] vs expected [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1]); objects concatenated wrong (e.g., 5/3/6 blocks shifted, missing 8's in expected right); lengths similar but positions/contents jumbled, suggesting sort or bounding error.
 * Sorting by -min_r works directionally but may fail on tied min_r or if min_r calc ignores trims.
 * No top/bottom trim function, leading to potential unhandled vertical protrusions (unobserved in trains but likely in test).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It's a 5x27 grid (very wide), with jumbled, asymmetric shapes (e.g., row0 has scattered 3/1/6/7/8/9, row2 has dense 3/8/1/7/6/9 blocks) that don't form coherent "symbols" like in trains (e.g., no clear letter-like clusters post-trim); lengths are inconsistent across rows? No, all 27, but visually messy with repeating 3/8 patterns suggesting under-trimmed protrusions or wrong component merging.
 * Compared to trains, it over-concatenates (27 cols vs train1's 12, train2's ~22), implying too many/large objects extracted or widths not trimmed (e.g., long horizontal 3/8 runs in row1/4 look like untrimmed bg-adjacent lines).
 * Missing expected "clean" separation: e.g., row2 has [4,3,8,3,...] starting with 4 (possibly a special case), but no obvious padding or filling; likely trimming failed (left/right rules didn't handle 3/6/7/9 mixes), and ordering placed bottom objects left (if min_r sort inverted).
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution—appears raw/unprocessed grid dump rather than standardized 5-row symbols; probably extracts extra small components or skips size check; unknown why so many 3/8/9 but no 2/4/5 balance like trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected components (non-background cells) are extracted from an input grid, trimmed and modified according to specific rules to form subgrids, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their bottom-most position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and background (bg) elements. The goal is to isolate and refine "objects" or "shapes" in the grid to match expected clean, compact representations without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0], and components are 4-way connected groups of non-bg cells; only components with more than 10 cells are processed to avoid noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrid for each component, then trim full outer bg columns (left/right) that span all rows.
 * Trim left protrusions iteratively: remove leftmost column if it's all bg, or if non-bg cells have <=3 unique values including 4, or exactly one unique value which is 8; this targets irregular extensions on the left side.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with stricter conditions: remove rightmost column if all bg, or non-bg has <=2 unique including 5, or single 8; this handles asymmetric right-side irregularities.
 * Special completion applies only to 5-row subgrids with width >=3: if left column is all the same non-bg value L (no bg mixed in), and right column has matching top/bottom non-bg non-L values, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3, then duplicate the penultimate column, append two full bg columns, and place 1's in the new columns at the row index of the single 4—this seems to "complete" incomplete shapes like adding symmetric elements or holes.
 * Pad subgrids to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering if too tall (trim to 5) or adding symmetric bg rows if short; if after processing a subgrid is empty, skip it.
 * Sort processed subgrids by descending min row index (bottom-first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; if no valid components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming is iterative and column-specific, so order matters (trim outer bg first, then protrusions); special completion can widen the subgrid unexpectedly, potentially adding columns that need further consideration.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are processed separately; concatenation extends rows horizontally without vertical stacking.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion rules are asymmetric (left tolerates more variety with 4, right stricter with 5), and special completion requires exact conditions (e.g., no bg in left, exactly one 4 on right middle)—mismatches here can leave artifacts.
 * Handle empty/edge cases: zero rows/cols return empty 5x0; bg=8 in some examples but varies (e.g., 6 in train1).
 * Output must match expected length and values exactly; extra/duplicated cells indicate over-processing or failed trimming.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt processes multiple large components (>10 cells) separately, trims them, applies special rules, pads to 5 rows, sorts bottom-first, and concatenates horizontally, which captures the core structure but fails on training examples due to over-inclusion or failed trimming.
 * Train 1 (bg=6?): Generated output has 15 columns per row vs. expected 12; it duplicates middle sections (e.g., [1,8,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,...] appears symmetric but with extra 8's and 1's not in expected [1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]); likely protrusion trimming didn't remove enough, or special completion misapplied, leaving artifacts like extra 8's around the 9 and in the middle blob.
 * Train 1 also shows top/bottom rows with extra 8's after the 9 (e.g., generated [6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] vs. expected [6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]), suggesting outer trim or padding failed to compact.
 * Train 2 (bg=4?): Generated has 21 columns vs. expected 22, but mismatched positions (e.g., generated row 0 starts [4,6,6,6,4,...] and includes misplaced 1's/3's/5's early, while expected shifts elements rightward with 4's filling left and 8's in specific spots); concatenation order or component bounding seems wrong, as it didn't align the 6's and 3's properly, and protrusion rules may have over-trimmed right side (missing some 8's).
 * Train 2 generated symmetric but bloated rows (e.g., row 2 has [3,5,3,6,6,1,2,1,3,3,...] vs. expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] starting later), indicating multiple components concatenated out of order or without proper left-trim for the key shape.
 * Overall, what worked: Component detection and basic bounding/padding seem functional (outputs are 5 rows, non-empty for valid inputs); sorting by minr descending places bottom objects first.
 * What didn't: Trimming protrusions is too aggressive or condition-mismatched (e.g., left trim removes too much variety, failing on sets without 4); special completion likely not triggering correctly (no evidence of added 1's in outputs); multi-component handling concatenates extras instead of selecting/isolating the main object(s); no vertical trimming beyond padding, so tall components may bloat.
 * The main program function is helpful as a skeleton but needs refined conditions in trims and better component filtering (e.g., perhaps merge overlapping or select only the largest).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all provided (find_components, bounding, trims, special, pad) are relevant, though trim conditions are buggy/subtly wrong for these cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (5 rows, ~27 columns each) does not look correct; it appears as a single bloated concatenation without clear object separation (e.g., row 0 mixes 3's,1's,6's,7's,8's irregularly like [3,1,6,1,3,3,3,1,7,1,4,1,7,8,6,6,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,6,6], suggesting multiple untrimmed components smashed together without proper bounding or protrusion removal.
 * It lacks compactness—expected should be shorter, cleaner subgrids (e.g., trimmed to remove bg=3? protrusions, with special completion if applicable), but this has repeating 3's/8's/6's that look like unprocessed edges or failed trims (e.g., long runs of 3's on right in row 0, mismatched with row 4's 8's/1's/3's).
 * No obvious special completion effects (e.g., no added 1's in bg columns), and the irregularity (e.g., row 2 has isolated 9's and 7's not aligned across rows) suggests the program over-concatenated small/large components or skipped size filter inconsistently; it doesn't resemble a refined puzzle output and likely fails if expected is a simple 5x12-15 grid like training.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.

    # Pads or crops to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering vertically if short, or cropping from top if tall.
    # Handles height normalization; note: width unchanged, assumes sub is non-empty.
```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-processing puzzle where large non-background connected components (representing "objects" or shapes) are extracted from an input grid, normalized through bounding, trimming protrusions and backgrounds, optional special completions for specific patterns, and padding to exactly 5 rows, then concatenated horizontally in top-to-bottom order to form a final 5-row output grid. The goal is to clean and arrange these objects to match an expected composite image, likely for a rebus or shape-based riddle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify background as the value at g[0][0] and only process components of size >=10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for flood-fill to find components; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.
 * Bounding subgrid must tightly crop around the component's min/max rows/cols, but subsequent trims handle outer pure-bg columns.
 * Trimming outer bg removes full columns of bg on left/right, but only after bounding; if trimming empties the subgrid, handle gracefully (e.g., return empty rows).
 * Left protrusion trim: Iteratively remove leftmost column if non-bg cells are few (<=3 unique values including 4) or single value 1; this targets irregular "stubs" without removing core shape.
 * Right protrusion trim: Similar to left but checks for 5 in non-bg or single 1; asymmetric conditions suggest puzzle shapes have direction-specific irregularities (e.g., 4 on left, 5 on right as markers).
 * Special complete: Only for exactly 5-row subgrids; checks uniform non-bg left column (L), uniform top/bottom right column (R != bg, !=L), exactly one 4 in middle right positions (rows 1-3), then appends duplicated penultimate column, followed by two columns with 1 at the 4's row position and bg elsewhere—this seems to "fill" or symmetrize specific incomplete shapes like letters or symbols.
 * Padding: Center to 5 rows with bg if <5 (symmetric top/bottom), or crop center 5 if >5; preserves width per row.
 * Sorting: Process components by min row descending (top-first), concatenate by extending each output row with the processed sub-row; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Assumes all objects fit in 5 rows post-pad; special complete adds width (duplicates +2 cols), which may be key for train2 mismatch; protrusion trims are iterative but stop at w<=1; non-bg uniqueness checks (sets) ignore bg but count only non-bg variety.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5 empty rows; components touching edge may need no extra bg trim; multiple components per "level" aren't handled (all concatenated flatly, but sorting by minr groups vertically).
 * Potential misses: Over-trimming core shape (e.g., if protrusion conditions hit main body); special complete not triggering when it should (e.g., row count exactly 5 pre-pad); concatenation order assumes no overlaps, but visual alignment might require spacing (not implemented).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core component extraction, bounding, basic trimming, and concatenation work for simple cases.
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output is a near-mirror symmetric 5x21 grid with repeated 4/6 blocks on sides, internal 1/3/5/8 patterns, but lacks the expected framing 1's on left/right edges, has mismatched internal placements (e.g., 2 and 3's shifted, extra 8's), and shorter widths per row (21 vs expected 22); top/bottom rows identical in generated but expected has extended 1's.
 * What worked: Large component detection (>=10) and vertical sorting by minr correctly isolated objects; padding to 5 rows preserved shapes in train1.
 * What didn't: For train2, protrusion trims likely over-removed or misapplied (e.g., conditions hit core instead of stubs, removing necessary 1's for framing); special_complete probably didn't trigger or added incorrectly, leading to asymmetric/missing fills (expected has more 1's and structured 3/4/5 blocks); concatenation extended rows unevenly, causing width mismatch.
 * trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but brittle—conditions (e.g., 4/5 presence) may false-positive on complex shapes; unhelpful if shapes have >3 unique non-bg in protrusions.
 * special_complete is key for train2-like cases but overly restrictive (e.g., requires exact uniform left/right, single middle 4); didn't activate properly, missing the expected "completion" of partial symbols.
 * Overall program structure (process -> sort -> concat) is solid but fails on subtleties like exact trim conditions and special patterns, leading to distorted objects in composite.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with dense, irregular patterns (e.g., row0: 3,6,1,3's then 7,4,8,6's; heavy 3/8/6/9 clusters, some 1/7/4 accents), but it looks incorrect—appears over-trimmed or uncompleted, with jagged edges (e.g., varying densities of 3's and 8's suggest untrimmed protrusions or missed special fills) and no clear framing/separation between potential objects, unlike expected structured composites in train2.
 * Doesn't make sense visually: Lacks symmetry or clean shapes (e.g., row2 has isolated 4,8,3 then 7,3,6's; row4 has long 8's then 1,3's), probably from failing to trim properly (e.g., left/right conditions not catching 9's or 7's as protrusions) or special_complete not applying to 5-row objects, resulting in concatenated mess instead of normalized symbols.
 * Compared to train2 failure, similar issues: Missing expected 1-framing and block alignments; widths consistent (25 cols) but content mismatched (e.g., no evident top/bottom mirroring or 4/5 completions); to fix, need broader trim conditions (e.g., include 7/9 in checks) and debug special_complete triggers for test's denser grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:21:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected "objects" (non-background components) from a 2D grid, processing them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, applying special rules for completion or adjustment, padding to a fixed 5-row height, and then horizontally concatenating them in vertical order (top-to-bottom) to form a new 5-row output grid representing the arranged puzzle solution.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the top-left cell value (often 8), and objects are 4-way connected non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller components are ignored.
 * Extract bounding boxes for each large component, then trim outer full-bg columns and rows to isolate the object tightly.
 * Subtle protrusion trims: Remove left columns if they are all bg or have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 (suggesting a "handle" or artifact); similarly for right columns but checking for 5 instead of 4— this seems asymmetric and potentially buggy for certain shapes.
 * Special completion rule only for exact 5-row subgrids: If left column has exactly one unique non-bg value L, and right column has matching top/bottom non-bg (not bg or L), with exactly one 4 in rows 1-3, duplicate the penultimate column and add two bg columns, then place 1's in specific positions based on the 4's row— this appears to "complete" incomplete shapes but is overly specific and may not trigger correctly.
 * After all trims and special rules, pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering if needed; if height >5, crop to center 5 rows.
 * Concatenate processed objects horizontally in order of decreasing max row index (topmost first), extending each of the 5 output rows; empty or all-bg objects are skipped.
 * Outputs must match exact lengths and values per row; mismatches often from over-trimming (losing parts), under-trimming (extra bg), wrong sorting/order, or special rule misapplication leading to added/duplicated cells.
 * Grids may have multiple objects; order matters (top-to-bottom), and no vertical stacking— all side-by-side in one 5-row canvas.
 * Subtleties: Protrusion rules might remove valid parts if sets include wrong numbers (e.g., len(s)<=3 and 4/5 present); special completion adds cells only under strict conditions, potentially missing "incomplete" objects; trimming after special completion can re-remove added parts; background assumption (top-left) fails if grid is empty or malformed.
 * Easy to miss: Components must be exactly >=10 cells; 4-way connectivity only (no diagonals); after all processing, if subgrid becomes empty, skip it; output rows may vary in length if objects have different widths, but expected often has uniform or specific lengths without trailing bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, finds large (>=10 cell) 4-way components, extracts bounding subgrids, and pads to 5 rows, but fails in trimming and special processing, leading to incorrect shapes and lengths in outputs.
 * Train 1 generated output has extra 8's (bg) inserted in rows 1-3 (e.g., row1: [6,1,1,1,8,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]— extras at positions ~6-8 and 10-11, and row2 has 1,4,1,1,1,1 vs expected 1,4,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3 with misplaced 2's/3's; row0/4 longer by 3 bg's)— likely from protrusion trims removing too little or special completion not applying, causing misaligned concatenation.
 * Train 2 generated output is much longer and jumbled (e.g., row0 starts [4,6,6,6,4,4,...1,1,1,1] vs expected [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,4,...1,1,1,1]— wrong order of objects, extra leading 6's, and row2 has 3,5,3,6,...4,4,1,4,4,1 vs expected 1,2,1,3,...8,4,4,1,4,4,1 with missing leading 1's/2's and extra 3's/5's)— suggests multiple components found but sorted/concatenated in wrong order (not purely by max_r descending) or over-trimming creating artifacts.
 * Sorting by -max_r (top-first) is present but may not handle ties or vertical overlaps correctly; concatenation extends rows without trimming trailing bg, leading to extra lengths.
 * Protrusion trim functions (trim_left_protrusions, trim_right_protrusions) are helpful in concept for removing artifacts but buggy— left checks for 4 in set, right for 5 (asymmetric, possibly wrong for puzzle); they loop to remove multiple columns but may strip valid parts if sets match criteria unexpectedly.
 * Special completion (apply_special_completion) is overly restrictive (requires h==5 pre-trim, exact one L on left, specific right column pattern with one 4)— didn't trigger in train1 (expected has a "completed" look with 2's/3's aligned), adding wrong cells or skipping when needed.
 * trim_outer_columns called twice (before/after protrusions) is redundant but helpful; however, row trim after special completion removes added bg, potentially undoing it.
 * Overall, core extraction works (components found), but processing chain (trims + special + pad + concat) introduces errors; no handling for diagonal connectivity or <10 components being valid in some cases.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are partially helpful but broken due to hardcoded 4/5 checks— adjust criteria or make symmetric; apply_special_completion is unhelpful as-is (too specific, doesn't fix train cases)— revise or remove.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as five uneven rows with mixed numbers (1,3,6,7,8,9) in a jumbled, non-object-like arrangement (e.g., row0: [1,6,1,3,3,3,1,7,1,1,7,8,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,3,3] starts with scattered 1/3/6/7, suggesting multiple poorly trimmed objects concatenated without proper isolation).
 * Unlike training expecteds (clean, aligned shapes like borders of 6/8/9 or 4/1/3 patterns), this has no clear 5-row object boundaries— e.g., vertical stacks of 3's and 8's look like untrimmed grid remnants rather than extracted/padded items, with extras like repeated 6's/8's indicating over-inclusion of bg or wrong component merging.
 * Row lengths are ~26-28 but inconsistent in structure (e.g., row4 ends with many 3's, row2 has isolated 7/9's), vs. expecteds' tighter ~12-23 lengths with symmetric padding; likely protrusion trims failed to remove "handles" (e.g., the 7's might be artifacts), and special completion didn't apply to "fix" incomplete shapes like the 9's cluster.
 * No obvious top-to-bottom ordering (e.g., 9's in row1/3 suggest mid-level object not sorted correctly); output includes small clusters (<10 cells?) like isolated 7's, violating size filter— mentally, test input seems to have 3-4 large objects (e.g., 3/8 borders, 6/9 blocks, 1/7 protrusions), but output mashes them without cleaning, missing subtle rules like completing 4/5 patterns or symmetric trims.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:21:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing symbols or colors on a background (bg, often 0 or similar), where the goal is to identify large connected non-background components (objects/symbols), extract and clean them via bounding boxes, trim extraneous backgrounds and protrusions based on shape heuristics, apply special framing rules for incomplete shapes, pad them to exactly 5 rows, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered by their vertical position in the original grid (top-to-bottom or similar).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "large" components as connected (4-directional adjacency) groups of non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller ones are ignored as noise.
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg from bg.
 * Extraction uses bounding subgrids, but must handle irregular shapes by trimming outer pure-bg columns (left/right/top/bottom implicitly via bounding).
 * Trimming protrusions is heuristic and shape-specific: left-side checks column diversity (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 triggers trim; single 1 after pending; single 8 resets pending); right-side similar but with 5/3/8 patterns— these seem tailored to specific symbol "artifacts" like stems or bars, but are brittle and miss general cases.
 * Special framing rule only for exactly 5-high subgrids: if uniform left column (non-bg), and right column has matching top/bot (non-bg, !=left), with a single 4 in rows 1-3 on right, then extend right by 3 columns of bg and place 1s in the "k" row— this is a very narrow fix for one incomplete frame type, easy to miss or overapply.
 * Padding to 5 rows: center vertically with bg rows if <5, truncate center if >5; widths preserved but concatenated horizontally.
 * Ordering: sort by minimum row index of component (descending/reverse, so topmost first?), then extend each output row by appending the processed subgrid's row.
 * Subtleties: Components may overlap in projection but are processed separately; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if empty (all bg or []); handle empty grids gracefully; protrusion trims can loop and chain (e.g., pending state across iterations); no rotation/flipping; assumes grid is rectangular; potential for multiple components per "symbol" but code treats each >=10 separately.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming doesn't handle top/bottom protrusions explicitly (only left/right); special frame adds fixed 3 columns, which may not generalize; concatenation assumes all subgrids same height post-pad (5), but widths vary; bg padding must match subgrid width; component finding uses DFS/stack, which is fine but must mark visited to avoid overlap.
 * General: Puzzle likely renders "text" or "symbols" via these objects; failures often from over-trimming/under-trimming or wrong ordering, leading to shape distortions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Extracts connected components of non-bg cells (4-dir) with size >=10 using DFS/stack and visited matrix.
    # Useful for isolating objects; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Works well as core extraction step.
```

```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes tight bounding box subgrid for a component, slicing original grid.
    # Essential for isolating each object without extra bg.
```

```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or truncates to exactly 5 rows, centering with bg rows; preserves width.
    # Helpful for standardization, but note: if h>5, it crops center—may lose top/bot details if asymmetric.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Trims pure-bg columns from left/right (vertical strips).
    # Basic but useful; doesn't handle top/bottom explicitly (could be added).
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on left column diversity (e.g., <=3 uniq with 4; pending for 1; single 8).
    # Broken: over-trims or under-trims specific shapes, causing distortions (e.g., leaves artifacts in train1).
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar heuristic for right (with 5/3/8).
    # Broken: inconsistent with left, misses cases, leads to asymmetric shapes.
```

```python
def special_complete_frame(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Narrow rule to add 3 bg columns + 1s in one row for specific 5-high frame.
    # Unhelpful: too specific (only triggers on exact left uniform + right patterns with single 4); doesn't apply broadly and may add wrong elements.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, bounding/extracting them, basic bg trimming, and padding/concatenation framework.
 * What worked: Component detection and basic structure (e.g., outputs are always 5 rows; finds non-bg blobs >=10); ordering by min_row (reverse) seems to place top objects first; handles empty cases.
 * What didn't: Protrusion trims are flawed heuristics, leading to incomplete cleaning (e.g., leaves extra 8s or distorts shapes); special frame doesn't trigger or fix relevant cases; no top/bottom trimming, causing height issues pre-pad; concatenation works but with dirty subgrids, so overall output polluted.
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in rows 1/3—has [6,1,1,8,8,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,...], indicating failed left trim (left object not fully cleaned to 1s, left 8s as bg or protrusion); symmetric top/bot rows match, middle row2 correct, right parts ok—suggests partial trim success but missed inner details (unknown why exactly, perhaps pending state bug or wrong uniqueness check).
 * Train2: Generated is ~5x14 but wrong structure/content (e.g., starts with [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs expected much longer ~5x22 with different ordering/layout); likely missed multiple components or wrong bounding/trim (e.g., didn't extract separate left/center/right objects fully; protrusion rules over-trimmed or concatenated prematurely); expected has repeated 4s/1s patterns suggesting multiple padded symbols, but generated merges/distorts them.
 * Overall: Core extraction good, but cleaning/processing steps brittle—leads to shape errors; no handling for vertical protrusions or general symmetry enforcement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with irregular patterns (e.g., row0 has mixed 1/6/3/7/8; row2/3/4 show vertical stacks of 3/8/6/1/7/9), but it does not look correct—likely over-concatenated or under-trimmed multiple components without proper cleaning, resulting in a "smeared" look (e.g., long horizontal runs of same numbers suggest untrimmed bg or protrusions bleeding across symbols; vertical alignments like 3-8-3-3-3 in col0 imply stacked but uncleaned objects).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Without ground truth, but based on trains, it should be cleaner, separated symbols (e.g., distinct blocks of 1-9 patterns padded to 5-high, no excessive 8s as apparent bg leaks); here, it seems to have extracted ~4-5 components but failed trims (e.g., 8s in row1 col1-8 look like untrimmed right protrusion from a left symbol; 9s in row1/2 col20-22 may be a partial object). This doesn't make sense as a final "rendered" puzzle output—too noisy and asymmetric compared to train expecteds' structured, symmetric symbol rows; probably needs better left/right trim rules and top/bottom handling to isolate clean 5-high blocks.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing shapes or blobs on a background, and the goal is to extract large connected components (non-background cells), process them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, handle special shape completions, pad to exactly 5 rows, sort them by their topmost row position (descending), and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid. The output represents an arranged view of cleaned-up shapes, likely for identification or matching in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only keep those with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for components; diagonals do not count.
 * Extract the minimal bounding subgrid for each component, then trim outer pure-background columns from all sides.
 * Trim left protrusions specifically: look for columns with full-height non-background where set includes 4 and <=3 unique values, or follow-up full-height {1} or sparse {1}; similar for right with 5 instead of 4; this seems to remove "antennae" or irregular extensions based on specific numbers like 4/5 (possibly denoting edges) and 1 (possibly a connector or filler).
 * Special handling for 5-row-high subgrids: if left column is uniform non-background C, right column has matching top/bottom D != C/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows on right, then append a copy of column 1 (second column) as new column 3 and a mostly-bg column 4 with 1 at the 4's row— this appears to "complete" an incomplete shape, but only if conditions match exactly.
 * Pad subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible; if over 5 rows, crop center 5.
 * Sort processed components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then horizontally concatenate their padded rows into the output; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming must preserve shape integrity—over-trimming can remove essential parts; special completion assumes exact 5-height and specific patterns, which may not always apply.
 * Output must match expected lengths and values exactly; mismatches often come from incorrect trimming (leaving extra bg or protrusions), wrong sorting/ordering of components, or failing to filter small components.
 * Background value varies per grid (always g[0][0]), and numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 likely represent colors, labels, or shape types that must be preserved.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming uses a "pending" state to chain trims (e.g., after detecting 4/5, allow subsequent {1} columns); without this, partial trims occur.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by top row, vertical alignment is implicit.
 * If subgrid width becomes 0 after trimming, skip it entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and last) submission shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding boxes, basic bg trimming, and padding/sorting logic.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS seems solid (finds blobs >=10); bounding subgrid extraction isolates shapes accurately; vertical padding to 5 rows standardizes output; sorting by min row descending and horizontal concat handles arrangement.
 * What didn't work: Trimming functions (outer_bg, left/right protrusions) are incomplete or buggy— in train 1, generated rows have extra elements (e.g., row 0: 14 elems vs expected 12, with extra 8's; row 1: extra 1,8,8 and misplaced 2's/3's); protrusions not fully removed, leaving bg or filler 1's/8's.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated includes extra 1's and 8's in middle (e.g., row1 has [6,1,1,1,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]—extra 1,8,8, and lengths differ by 2); row2 has extra 1,1,1,1,1 vs expected cleaner [6,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3]; symmetric rows duplicated incorrectly; unknown reason for extras, possibly over-retention in trimming or special_complete_shape adding wrong columns.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Severe—generated rows much longer (e.g., row0: 23 elems vs expected 22), with misplaced 6's/4's/1's at start ( [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs [4,4,4,4,...] ); components seem extracted but not trimmed/sorted right, leading to duplicated or shifted shapes (e.g., 5,3,5 patterns appear early but expected later); protrusions like left 4's/6's not handled, causing overlap or extras.
 * Special_complete_shape likely unhelpful—may be adding phantom columns in train 1 (extras around 8's/1's).
 * Overall, core extraction works, but processing (trimming/special) fails to clean shapes, leading to polluted outputs; no small components included (good), but large ones not refined properly.
 * Function trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but only does columns—may need row trimming for full cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as the program failed both training examples with similar trimming/processing errors (extras, length mismatches, misplaced values), suggesting it would mishandle test's complex grid similarly.
 * Issues: Rows have varying lengths (e.g., row0: 34 elems, but inconsistent patterns like clustered 3's/1's/6's/4's/7's/8's/9's suggest untrimmed protrusions or incomplete component isolation; e.g., repeated 3's and 8's look like retained bg or partial shapes.
 * Missing expected cleanliness: Expected output should have distinct, trimmed shapes concatenated without extras (e.g., no long runs of 8's/bg if trimmed right); here, dense 3's/8's/9's indicate over-retention, and values like 7/9 may be from unprocessed parts.
 * Does not make sense: Patterns like vertical 3's on left and scattered 1's/4's/6's suggest multiple components concatenated but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left columns have full-height 3's that might be protrusions per rules); special shapes not completed properly, leading to asymmetric or incomplete blobs; overall too noisy compared to cleaner expected trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected non-background components (objects or "blobs") must be extracted, trimmed to remove backgrounds and irregular protrusions, potentially modified with special rules (like completing frames), padded to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, sorted by the objects' original topmost row position in descending order (top-to-bottom priority).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (e.g., 6 in train1, 4 in train2 expected); all processing treats cells != bg as part of objects.
 * Only components with >=10 connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) are considered "large" and extracted; smaller ones are ignored.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes around components, then trims outer full-bg columns.
 * Trimming protrusions is asymmetric and rule-based: left side trims columns with <=3 non-bg cells containing 4 or 5, or full columns of 8; enters "pending" mode for follow-up {1,8}-only columns; right side similar but focused on 5 and 8, without the 4 condition.
 * Special rule: For 5-row subgrids, if left column is uniform non-bg color (except bg), and right has specific pattern (top/bottom matching non-bg, not equal to left color, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3), append 3 bg-padded cells with a 1 in the row matching the 4's position— this seems to "complete" an incomplete frame but is very narrow and may over-apply or miss.
 * Padding: Center-pad or crop to exactly 5 rows with bg; if >5 rows, crop from middle; if <5, symmetric bg rows top/bottom.
 * Final output: Sort extracted/padded subgrids by min_row descending (top objects first), concatenate rows horizontally; if no objects, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must preserve object integrity (e.g., don't remove core shapes); special frame only for exact 5-high cases and may add width unexpectedly; sorting ensures vertical order but assumes non-overlapping components; connected components must ignore bg strictly; potential for multiple objects per row or stacked vertically; outputs retain original colors (1-9 likely represent shapes/colors); easy to miss: protrusion rules are color-specific (e.g., 1,4,5,8) and stateful (pending flag), leading to over/under-trimming; bounding box may include extra bg if not trimmed fully; no vertical trimming mentioned, so heights vary before padding.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle asymmetric shapes (e.g., protrusions only on sides); verify component size threshold (10 may be too high/low for some); special rules might be over-generalized or buggy (e.g., applies when not needed); concatenation assumes fixed 5 rows but variable widths; test for overlapping components or bg enclaves inside objects (current flood-fill ignores inner bg holes).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Flood-fill to find connected components >=10 cells, ignoring bg; uses DFS stack.
    # Helpful for isolating objects; returns list of (row,col) lists per component.
    # Note: Assumes 4-connectivity; visited matrix prevents revisits.
```

def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid bounding the component cells.
    # Helpful as starting point for per-object processing; includes some bg edges.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns from subgrid.
    # Helpful for cleaning bounding box; simple and non-destructive to object.
```

```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads/crops subgrid to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering where possible.
    # Essential for uniform output height; handles varying original heights.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding subgrids, and applying basic trimming/padding/concatenation/sorting.
 * What worked: Component detection via flood-fill is solid (finds non-bg blobs >=10 cells); bounding extraction and outer bg trim work for isolating rough shapes; padding to 5 rows ensures output format; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftward correctly in principle; for train1, the overall structure (e.g., three objects concatenated) is right, and colors mostly match except specific trim failures.
 * What didn't work: Protrusion trimming is incomplete/buggy— in train1, left trim failed to remove a bg column inside the first object, leaving extra 8s instead of connecting 1s (generated row1/3: 1,1,8,... vs expected 1,1,1,...; specific diff: positions 3-4 in first object have 8 where 1 expected, suggesting missed inner bg strip); right trim similar issues; special_complete_frame didn't trigger or apply correctly (no added elements visible, but may not have been needed); for train2, entire output is wrong—generated has wrong widths/heights, misplaced colors (e.g., long 4/6 runs at edges, but expected has reoriented/trimmed objects with different concatenation order/positions like 1,2,1 in row2 vs generated 3,5,6); unknown why train2 objects weren't isolated cleanly (possibly over-trimming or wrong component detection, e.g., merged separate blobs); component size threshold (10) may exclude/include wrongly; no vertical trimming, leading to uneven handling; special frame function is narrow (only 5-high, specific patterns) and likely unhelpful/broken for general cases (doesn't apply in examples but could add spurious width); trim_left/right_protrusions are overly complex/stateful and error-prone (pending logic fails on color sets like {4,5} not propagating correctly, leading to partial trims).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_large_components serves similar role and is essential; overall, attempt shows core extraction/sorting but fails on precise trimming, causing shape distortions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as a messy, wide concatenation (32 cols) with irregular patterns (e.g., scattered 1-9, long 3/8/6 runs, apparent merged blobs like vertical 3s and 4s), but lacks clean isolated objects—e.g., row0 has clustered 1,3,7,4,6 but no clear trimmed shapes; compared to train examples, expected outputs have symmetric/padded objects (e.g., train1 has clean 1/4/1 frames with 8 bg), while this has no obvious bg padding or frames, suggesting over-merging components or failed trims (e.g., untrimmed protrusions like the 7s/8s clusters); widths don't align with expected object isolation (too many cols for 3-4 objects); colors like repeated 3/6/8 indicate possible wrong bg detection or inclusion of small components; it does not match a mentally simulated correct output, which should have 3-5 trimmed 5-row objects (e.g., a left blob with 2/4/3, middle with 1/7/8 frame, right with 6/9/3) concatenated cleanly with bg spaces, but this seems to include extraneous connections (e.g., the 7 in row2/3 connects what should be separate).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to identify, extract, and standardize "objects" (connected non-background components of size >=10) from an input grid of integers (representing pixel colors/labels), then trim them according to specific protrusion and special rules, pad/crop to exactly 5 rows, and horizontally concatenate them in vertical order (top-to-bottom based on minimum row index) into a fixed 5-row output grid, preserving the background value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores or trims pure bg areas.
 * Connected components use 4-directional adjacency (up/down/left/right); only include cells != bg; must be size >=10 to qualify as an "object".
 * Bounding subgrid extracts the minimal rectangle around a component, but does not initially trim top/bottom (only left/right outer bg columns in trim_outer_bg).
 * Trimming is asymmetric and rule-based: trim_outer_bg removes full left/right columns of bg; trim_left_protrusions uses complex heuristics (e.g., column sets with <=3 types including 4, or "pending" counts of 1's, or single 8) to remove left "protrusions" iteratively; trim_right_protrusions is simpler (e.g., <=2 types including 5, or single 8).
 * apply_special is a niche rule: only for exactly 5-row subgrids with uniform non-bg left column L, right column with matching top/bottom !=bg !=L, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3 of right column; appends two new columns with a single 1 in the row matching the 4's position, rest bg— this seems to "fill" or "correct" specific shapes like incomplete letters/symbols.
 * Padding/cropping to 5 rows: if <5 rows, center-pad with bg rows (top/bottom); if >5, crop to middle 5 rows (not top or bottom aligned); no horizontal padding mentioned, but output is concatenated directly.
 * Output ordering: Sort objects by descending min_row (topmost first), then extend each output row by appending the corresponding row from each processed object horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Trimming rules are heuristic and color-specific (e.g., favoring 1,4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle encodes symbols/letters where certain numbers represent strokes (e.g., 1 for lines, 4/5/8 for curves/hooks); over-trimming can remove valid parts (e.g., turning 1's into 8's/bg); under-trimming leaves protrusions; special rule only triggers on exact 5-high; no rotation/reflection; empty input yields 5 empty rows; components may overlap in horizontal space but are processed independently; output lengths vary based on object widths post-trimming.
 * Easy-to-miss: Top/bottom trimming is absent in current code (only left/right), leading to untrimmed vertical bg; pending_count in left trim is a stateful counter for sequences of 1's, but resets unclearly; right trim lacks pending logic; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftmost, but if min_r ties, order is arbitrary (not specified); generated outputs show length mismatches, indicating width calculation errors post-trimming.

        return padded
    return sub
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction and horizontal concatenation but fails on trimming and special rules.
 * find_large_components works well (correctly identifies qualifying objects in train1, as shapes are mostly preserved).
 * trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but incomplete (only handles left/right columns, misses top/bottom full bg rows, leading to potential vertical artifacts).
 * trim_left_protrusions is over-aggressive or miscalibrated: in train1, it incorrectly trims columns containing 1's (replacing them with 8/bg), e.g., row1/4 have 8 where expected 1 (missing third 1 in left object); pending_count logic for 1's seems buggy (resets to non_bg.count(1) but decrements without clear init/reset per object).
 * trim_right_protrusions underperforms in train2: fails to align or trim right-side objects properly, resulting in mismatched widths/positions (e.g., generated has 21+ cols per row vs expected 22, with 4's and 6's shifted left).
 * apply_special did not trigger in train1 (expected no change, but trimming issue masked it); unclear if it fired in train2, but output suggests special "filling" (e.g., extra 1's) was missed.
 * pad_to_5_rows works for vertical standardization but inherits trimming errors; in train2, middle-cropping >5 row objects may have cut key parts.
 * Overall in train1: Left object trimming wrong (generated row1: [6,1,1,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,...]; same for row4; row2/3 correct), right objects intact; lengths match but content differs by one column of 8->1.
 * Overall in train2: Major misalignment—generated starts with left-heavy 4/6/1 blocks out of order (e.g., row1 has [4,6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1] vs expected [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1]); objects concatenated wrong (e.g., 5/3/6 blocks shifted, missing 8's in expected right); lengths similar but positions/contents jumbled, suggesting sort or bounding error.
 * Sorting by -min_r works directionally but may fail on tied min_r or if min_r calc ignores trims.
 * No top/bottom trim function, leading to potential unhandled vertical protrusions (unobserved in trains but likely in test).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It's a 5x27 grid (very wide), with jumbled, asymmetric shapes (e.g., row0 has scattered 3/1/6/7/8/9, row2 has dense 3/8/1/7/6/9 blocks) that don't form coherent "symbols" like in trains (e.g., no clear letter-like clusters post-trim); lengths are inconsistent across rows? No, all 27, but visually messy with repeating 3/8 patterns suggesting under-trimmed protrusions or wrong component merging.
 * Compared to trains, it over-concatenates (27 cols vs train1's 12, train2's ~22), implying too many/large objects extracted or widths not trimmed (e.g., long horizontal 3/8 runs in row1/4 look like untrimmed bg-adjacent lines).
 * Missing expected "clean" separation: e.g., row2 has [4,3,8,3,...] starting with 4 (possibly a special case), but no obvious padding or filling; likely trimming failed (left/right rules didn't handle 3/6/7/9 mixes), and ordering placed bottom objects left (if min_r sort inverted).
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution—appears raw/unprocessed grid dump rather than standardized 5-row symbols; probably extracts extra small components or skips size check; unknown why so many 3/8/9 but no 2/4/5 balance like trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected components (non-background cells) are extracted from an input grid, trimmed and modified according to specific rules to form subgrids, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their bottom-most position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and background (bg) elements. The goal is to isolate and refine "objects" or "shapes" in the grid to match expected clean, compact representations without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0], and components are 4-way connected groups of non-bg cells; only components with more than 10 cells are processed to avoid noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrid for each component, then trim full outer bg columns (left/right) that span all rows.
 * Trim left protrusions iteratively: remove leftmost column if it's all bg, or if non-bg cells have <=3 unique values including 4, or exactly one unique value which is 8; this targets irregular extensions on the left side.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with stricter conditions: remove rightmost column if all bg, or non-bg has <=2 unique including 5, or single 8; this handles asymmetric right-side irregularities.
 * Special completion applies only to 5-row subgrids with width >=3: if left column is all the same non-bg value L (no bg mixed in), and right column has matching top/bottom non-bg non-L values, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3, then duplicate the penultimate column, append two full bg columns, and place 1's in the new columns at the row index of the single 4—this seems to "complete" incomplete shapes like adding symmetric elements or holes.
 * Pad subgrids to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering if too tall (trim to 5) or adding symmetric bg rows if short; if after processing a subgrid is empty, skip it.
 * Sort processed subgrids by descending min row index (bottom-first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; if no valid components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming is iterative and column-specific, so order matters (trim outer bg first, then protrusions); special completion can widen the subgrid unexpectedly, potentially adding columns that need further consideration.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are processed separately; concatenation extends rows horizontally without vertical stacking.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion rules are asymmetric (left tolerates more variety with 4, right stricter with 5), and special completion requires exact conditions (e.g., no bg in left, exactly one 4 on right middle)—mismatches here can leave artifacts.
 * Handle empty/edge cases: zero rows/cols return empty 5x0; bg=8 in some examples but varies (e.g., 6 in train1).
 * Output must match expected length and values exactly; extra/duplicated cells indicate over-processing or failed trimming.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt processes multiple large components (>10 cells) separately, trims them, applies special rules, pads to 5 rows, sorts bottom-first, and concatenates horizontally, which captures the core structure but fails on training examples due to over-inclusion or failed trimming.
 * Train 1 (bg=6?): Generated output has 15 columns per row vs. expected 12; it duplicates middle sections (e.g., [1,8,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,...] appears symmetric but with extra 8's and 1's not in expected [1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]); likely protrusion trimming didn't remove enough, or special completion misapplied, leaving artifacts like extra 8's around the 9 and in the middle blob.
 * Train 1 also shows top/bottom rows with extra 8's after the 9 (e.g., generated [6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] vs. expected [6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]), suggesting outer trim or padding failed to compact.
 * Train 2 (bg=4?): Generated has 21 columns vs. expected 22, but mismatched positions (e.g., generated row 0 starts [4,6,6,6,4,...] and includes misplaced 1's/3's/5's early, while expected shifts elements rightward with 4's filling left and 8's in specific spots); concatenation order or component bounding seems wrong, as it didn't align the 6's and 3's properly, and protrusion rules may have over-trimmed right side (missing some 8's).
 * Train 2 generated symmetric but bloated rows (e.g., row 2 has [3,5,3,6,6,1,2,1,3,3,...] vs. expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] starting later), indicating multiple components concatenated out of order or without proper left-trim for the key shape.
 * Overall, what worked: Component detection and basic bounding/padding seem functional (outputs are 5 rows, non-empty for valid inputs); sorting by minr descending places bottom objects first.
 * What didn't: Trimming protrusions is too aggressive or condition-mismatched (e.g., left trim removes too much variety, failing on sets without 4); special completion likely not triggering correctly (no evidence of added 1's in outputs); multi-component handling concatenates extras instead of selecting/isolating the main object(s); no vertical trimming beyond padding, so tall components may bloat.
 * The main program function is helpful as a skeleton but needs refined conditions in trims and better component filtering (e.g., perhaps merge overlapping or select only the largest).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all provided (find_components, bounding, trims, special, pad) are relevant, though trim conditions are buggy/subtly wrong for these cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (5 rows, ~27 columns each) does not look correct; it appears as a single bloated concatenation without clear object separation (e.g., row 0 mixes 3's,1's,6's,7's,8's irregularly like [3,1,6,1,3,3,3,1,7,1,4,1,7,8,6,6,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,6,6], suggesting multiple untrimmed components smashed together without proper bounding or protrusion removal.
 * It lacks compactness—expected should be shorter, cleaner subgrids (e.g., trimmed to remove bg=3? protrusions, with special completion if applicable), but this has repeating 3's/8's/6's that look like unprocessed edges or failed trims (e.g., long runs of 3's on right in row 0, mismatched with row 4's 8's/1's/3's).
 * No obvious special completion effects (e.g., no added 1's in bg columns), and the irregularity (e.g., row 2 has isolated 9's and 7's not aligned across rows) suggests the program over-concatenated small/large components or skipped size filter inconsistently; it doesn't resemble a refined puzzle output and likely fails if expected is a simple 5x12-15 grid like training.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected "objects" (non-background components) from a 2D grid, processing them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, applying special rules for completion or adjustment, padding to a fixed 5-row height, and then horizontally concatenating them in vertical order (top-to-bottom) to form a new 5-row output grid representing the arranged puzzle solution.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the top-left cell value (often 8), and objects are 4-way connected non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller components are ignored.
 * Extract bounding boxes for each large component, then trim outer full-bg columns and rows to isolate the object tightly.
 * Subtle protrusion trims: Remove left columns if they are all bg or have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 (suggesting a "handle" or artifact); similarly for right columns but checking for 5 instead of 4— this seems asymmetric and potentially buggy for certain shapes.
 * Special completion rule only for exact 5-row subgrids: If left column has exactly one unique non-bg value L, and right column has matching top/bottom non-bg (not bg or L), with exactly one 4 in rows 1-3, duplicate the penultimate column and add two bg columns, then place 1's in specific positions based on the 4's row— this appears to "complete" incomplete shapes but is overly specific and may not trigger correctly.
 * After all trims and special rules, pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering if needed; if height >5, crop to center 5 rows.
 * Concatenate processed objects horizontally in order of decreasing max row index (topmost first), extending each of the 5 output rows; empty or all-bg objects are skipped.
 * Outputs must match exact lengths and values per row; mismatches often from over-trimming (losing parts), under-trimming (extra bg), wrong sorting/order, or special rule misapplication leading to added/duplicated cells.
 * Grids may have multiple objects; order matters (top-to-bottom), and no vertical stacking— all side-by-side in one 5-row canvas.
 * Subtleties: Protrusion rules might remove valid parts if sets include wrong numbers (e.g., len(s)<=3 and 4/5 present); special completion adds cells only under strict conditions, potentially missing "incomplete" objects; trimming after special completion can re-remove added parts; background assumption (top-left) fails if grid is empty or malformed.
 * Easy to miss: Components must be exactly >=10 cells; 4-way connectivity only (no diagonals); after all processing, if subgrid becomes empty, skip it; output rows may vary in length if objects have different widths, but expected often has uniform or specific lengths without trailing bg.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, finds large (>=10 cell) 4-way components, extracts bounding subgrids, and pads to 5 rows, but fails in trimming and special processing, leading to incorrect shapes and lengths in outputs.
 * Train 1 generated output has extra 8's (bg) inserted in rows 1-3 (e.g., row1: [6,1,1,1,8,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]— extras at positions ~6-8 and 10-11, and row2 has 1,4,1,1,1,1 vs expected 1,4,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3 with misplaced 2's/3's; row0/4 longer by 3 bg's)— likely from protrusion trims removing too little or special completion not applying, causing misaligned concatenation.
 * Train 2 generated output is much longer and jumbled (e.g., row0 starts [4,6,6,6,4,4,...1,1,1,1] vs expected [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,4,...1,1,1,1]— wrong order of objects, extra leading 6's, and row2 has 3,5,3,6,...4,4,1,4,4,1 vs expected 1,2,1,3,...8,4,4,1,4,4,1 with missing leading 1's/2's and extra 3's/5's)— suggests multiple components found but sorted/concatenated in wrong order (not purely by max_r descending) or over-trimming creating artifacts.
 * Sorting by -max_r (top-first) is present but may not handle ties or vertical overlaps correctly; concatenation extends rows without trimming trailing bg, leading to extra lengths.
 * Protrusion trim functions (trim_left_protrusions, trim_right_protrusions) are helpful in concept for removing artifacts but buggy— left checks for 4 in set, right for 5 (asymmetric, possibly wrong for puzzle); they loop to remove multiple columns but may strip valid parts if sets match criteria unexpectedly.
 * Special completion (apply_special_completion) is overly restrictive (requires h==5 pre-trim, exact one L on left, specific right column pattern with one 4)— didn't trigger in train1 (expected has a "completed" look with 2's/3's aligned), adding wrong cells or skipping when needed.
 * trim_outer_columns called twice (before/after protrusions) is redundant but helpful; however, row trim after special completion removes added bg, potentially undoing it.
 * Overall, core extraction works (components found), but processing chain (trims + special + pad + concat) introduces errors; no handling for diagonal connectivity or <10 components being valid in some cases.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are partially helpful but broken due to hardcoded 4/5 checks— adjust criteria or make symmetric; apply_special_completion is unhelpful as-is (too specific, doesn't fix train cases)— revise or remove.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as five uneven rows with mixed numbers (1,3,6,7,8,9) in a jumbled, non-object-like arrangement (e.g., row0: [1,6,1,3,3,3,1,7,1,1,7,8,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,3,3] starts with scattered 1/3/6/7, suggesting multiple poorly trimmed objects concatenated without proper isolation).
 * Unlike training expecteds (clean, aligned shapes like borders of 6/8/9 or 4/1/3 patterns), this has no clear 5-row object boundaries— e.g., vertical stacks of 3's and 8's look like untrimmed grid remnants rather than extracted/padded items, with extras like repeated 6's/8's indicating over-inclusion of bg or wrong component merging.
 * Row lengths are ~26-28 but inconsistent in structure (e.g., row4 ends with many 3's, row2 has isolated 7/9's), vs. expecteds' tighter ~12-23 lengths with symmetric padding; likely protrusion trims failed to remove "handles" (e.g., the 7's might be artifacts), and special completion didn't apply to "fix" incomplete shapes like the 9's cluster.
 * No obvious top-to-bottom ordering (e.g., 9's in row1/3 suggest mid-level object not sorted correctly); output includes small clusters (<10 cells?) like isolated 7's, violating size filter— mentally, test input seems to have 3-4 large objects (e.g., 3/8 borders, 6/9 blocks, 1/7 protrusions), but output mashes them without cleaning, missing subtle rules like completing 4/5 patterns or symmetric trims.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.

    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid bounding the component cells from the original grid.
    # Preserves original values (including internal bg or holes); essential for shape fidelity.
```
```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns across all rows; returns empty if fully bg.
    # Basic cleanup; works well for outer padding.
```
```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or crops to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering vertically if short, or cropping from top if tall.
    # Handles height normalization; note: width unchanged, assumes sub is non-empty.
```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-processing puzzle where large non-background connected components (representing "objects" or shapes) are extracted from an input grid, normalized through bounding, trimming protrusions and backgrounds, optional special completions for specific patterns, and padding to exactly 5 rows, then concatenated horizontally in top-to-bottom order to form a final 5-row output grid. The goal is to clean and arrange these objects to match an expected composite image, likely for a rebus or shape-based riddle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify background as the value at g[0][0] and only process components of size >=10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for flood-fill to find components; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.
 * Bounding subgrid must tightly crop around the component's min/max rows/cols, but subsequent trims handle outer pure-bg columns.
 * Trimming outer bg removes full columns of bg on left/right, but only after bounding; if trimming empties the subgrid, handle gracefully (e.g., return empty rows).
 * Left protrusion trim: Iteratively remove leftmost column if non-bg cells are few (<=3 unique values including 4) or single value 1; this targets irregular "stubs" without removing core shape.
 * Right protrusion trim: Similar to left but checks for 5 in non-bg or single 1; asymmetric conditions suggest puzzle shapes have direction-specific irregularities (e.g., 4 on left, 5 on right as markers).
 * Special complete: Only for exactly 5-row subgrids; checks uniform non-bg left column (L), uniform top/bottom right column (R != bg, !=L), exactly one 4 in middle right positions (rows 1-3), then appends duplicated penultimate column, followed by two columns with 1 at the 4's row position and bg elsewhere—this seems to "fill" or symmetrize specific incomplete shapes like letters or symbols.
 * Padding: Center to 5 rows with bg if <5 (symmetric top/bottom), or crop center 5 if >5; preserves width per row.
 * Sorting: Process components by min row descending (top-first), concatenate by extending each output row with the processed sub-row; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Assumes all objects fit in 5 rows post-pad; special complete adds width (duplicates +2 cols), which may be key for train2 mismatch; protrusion trims are iterative but stop at w<=1; non-bg uniqueness checks (sets) ignore bg but count only non-bg variety.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5 empty rows; components touching edge may need no extra bg trim; multiple components per "level" aren't handled (all concatenated flatly, but sorting by minr groups vertically).
 * Potential misses: Over-trimming core shape (e.g., if protrusion conditions hit main body); special complete not triggering when it should (e.g., row count exactly 5 pre-pad); concatenation order assumes no overlaps, but visual alignment might require spacing (not implemented).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core component extraction, bounding, basic trimming, and concatenation work for simple cases.
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output is a near-mirror symmetric 5x21 grid with repeated 4/6 blocks on sides, internal 1/3/5/8 patterns, but lacks the expected framing 1's on left/right edges, has mismatched internal placements (e.g., 2 and 3's shifted, extra 8's), and shorter widths per row (21 vs expected 22); top/bottom rows identical in generated but expected has extended 1's.
 * What worked: Large component detection (>=10) and vertical sorting by minr correctly isolated objects; padding to 5 rows preserved shapes in train1.
 * What didn't: For train2, protrusion trims likely over-removed or misapplied (e.g., conditions hit core instead of stubs, removing necessary 1's for framing); special_complete probably didn't trigger or added incorrectly, leading to asymmetric/missing fills (expected has more 1's and structured 3/4/5 blocks); concatenation extended rows unevenly, causing width mismatch.
 * trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but brittle—conditions (e.g., 4/5 presence) may false-positive on complex shapes; unhelpful if shapes have >3 unique non-bg in protrusions.
 * special_complete is key for train2-like cases but overly restrictive (e.g., requires exact uniform left/right, single middle 4); didn't activate properly, missing the expected "completion" of partial symbols.
 * Overall program structure (process -> sort -> concat) is solid but fails on subtleties like exact trim conditions and special patterns, leading to distorted objects in composite.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with dense, irregular patterns (e.g., row0: 3,6,1,3's then 7,4,8,6's; heavy 3/8/6/9 clusters, some 1/7/4 accents), but it looks incorrect—appears over-trimmed or uncompleted, with jagged edges (e.g., varying densities of 3's and 8's suggest untrimmed protrusions or missed special fills) and no clear framing/separation between potential objects, unlike expected structured composites in train2.
 * Doesn't make sense visually: Lacks symmetry or clean shapes (e.g., row2 has isolated 4,8,3 then 7,3,6's; row4 has long 8's then 1,3's), probably from failing to trim properly (e.g., left/right conditions not catching 9's or 7's as protrusions) or special_complete not applying to 5-row objects, resulting in concatenated mess instead of normalized symbols.
 * Compared to train2 failure, similar issues: Missing expected 1-framing and block alignments; widths consistent (25 cols) but content mismatched (e.g., no evident top/bottom mirroring or 4/5 completions); to fix, need broader trim conditions (e.g., include 7/9 in checks) and debug special_complete triggers for test's denser grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on unique non-bg values (<=3 incl. 4 or single 8); over-specific to numbers, causes incorrect trimming in train2 (e.g., removes parts of main object).
    # Broken/not general: Fails when patterns don't match exact conditions, leading to asymmetric or incomplete shapes.
    # Do not reuse without generalization.
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar to left, but <=2 unique incl. 5; mismatched train2 right side (e.g., disrupts "1" bars or object edges).
    # Broken: Too rigid, doesn't handle variable number patterns; results in width mismatches.
    # Avoid; replace with more robust edge detection.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles component extraction and basic bounding/outer trimming, as evidenced by train1 passing fully.
 * Train1 correct: Likely simple case with one or symmetric components where ordering/trimming didn't interfere.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:26:30] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers to identify, extract, and refine large connected non-background components (objects) into a standardized 5-row output format, where objects are trimmed of backgrounds and protrusions, potentially completed with special rules, padded vertically to 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in reverse row-order priority. The goal is to produce a clean, concatenated representation of these processed objects, likely for a visual puzzle like assembling icons or symbols from a cluttered grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg cells as part of objects.
 * Only components with 10 or more cells are considered "large" and extracted; smaller ones are ignored.
 * Objects are extracted as subgrids based on bounding boxes, then trimmed: remove outer full-bg columns/rows, and iteratively trim left/right columns that are mostly bg or simple protrusions (e.g., sets of <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 on left or 5 on right, or single 1).
 * Special completion rule applies only to 5-row subgrids: if left column is uniform non-bg (L), right column has mismatched top/bottom not equal to L/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows (1-3), append columns to extend rightward with bg and insert 1's at the 4's row position.
 * Padding centers subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg; if >5 rows, crop to central 5.
 * Processed objects are sorted by min_r descending (top-to-bottom reversed) and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid.
 * Subtle: Trimming must be sequential (columns then rows then protrusions) to avoid over-trimming; special completion can extend width dynamically.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right, no diagonals).
 * Output rows can vary in length if no objects, but defaults to empty 5 rows; concatenation preserves all processed widths without further alignment.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming conditions are asymmetric (left checks for 4, right for 5) and allow single-1 columns; special completion requires exact 5 rows pre-padding and specific right-column patterns.
 * If multiple objects, order by reverse min_r ensures "higher" (smaller row index) objects appear rightmost in output.
 * Grids may have varying sizes, but output is always 5 rows; empty or all-bg grids return 5 empty rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT - Successfully extracted, trimmed, and concatenated objects into the expected 5-row format, demonstrating core component finding, bounding, trimming, and ordering work for simple cases.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT - Generated output has symmetric top/bottom rows with [4,6,6,6,4...] starting each, middle rows with mismatched patterns like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] and [3,5,3,6,6,8,...], and shorter lengths (~21 cols/row); expected has asymmetric structure with longer rows (~22 cols), top/bottom [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4...1,1,1,1], middle rows starting with [1,1,1,4...] or [1,2,1,3...] and including trailing 1's, suggesting over-trimming of left/right protrusions, failure to apply special completion correctly, or incorrect concatenation order/positioning of multiple objects.
 * The trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions functions may be too aggressive or misapplied in sequence, removing parts that should be retained (e.g., single-1 or 4/5-inclusive columns that are structural).
 * apply_special_completion did not trigger or extend properly, as generated lacks the expected extended patterns with 1's in specific positions.
 * Sorting by reverse min_r placed objects in wrong horizontal order, leading to mismatched alignments (e.g., generated has repeated 4/6 blocks without the expected 1/2/3 prefixes).
 * pad_to_5_rows works but may interact poorly if subgrids are not pre-trimmed correctly, causing bg padding in wrong places.
 * Overall, component extraction via find_large_components is solid (as it passed train 1), but post-extraction processing (trimming and completion) fails on multi-object or asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x23 grid with patterns like top row [6,1,3,3,3,1,7,1,7,8,6,6,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,6,6], showing clustered 3's, 6's, 8's, and scattered 1/7/9, suggesting multiple concatenated objects (e.g., left block with 6/1/3/7/8, middle with 1/3/8/9, right with 3/6).
 * It does not look fully correct: Patterns appear over-trimmed (e.g., bottom row has long 8's then 3/7/3 block then 1/3's, but lacks symmetry or completion extensions seen in train 2 expected); middle rows have isolated 1's and 7's that might be protrusions not trimmed properly, and the overall structure doesn't align into clean symbols (e.g., no clear 5-row uniform columns for special completion). Compared to train 2 errors, it likely suffers from similar issues: incorrect protrusion removal (retaining or removing 7/9 as non-simple) and no evident special completion (no appended 1's). Without expected test output, it's unclear if lengths match, but the asymmetry and scattered values suggest incomplete handling of object boundaries or ordering.

[2025-10-01 15:26:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing symbols or colors on a background (bg, often 0 or similar), where the goal is to identify large connected non-background components (objects/symbols), extract and clean them via bounding boxes, trim extraneous backgrounds and protrusions based on shape heuristics, apply special framing rules for incomplete shapes, pad them to exactly 5 rows, and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered by their vertical position in the original grid (top-to-bottom or similar).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "large" components as connected (4-directional adjacency) groups of non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller ones are ignored as noise.
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg from bg.
 * Extraction uses bounding subgrids, but must handle irregular shapes by trimming outer pure-bg columns (left/right/top/bottom implicitly via bounding).
 * Trimming protrusions is heuristic and shape-specific: left-side checks column diversity (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 triggers trim; single 1 after pending; single 8 resets pending); right-side similar but with 5/3/8 patterns— these seem tailored to specific symbol "artifacts" like stems or bars, but are brittle and miss general cases.
 * Special framing rule only for exactly 5-high subgrids: if uniform left column (non-bg), and right column has matching top/bot (non-bg, !=left), with a single 4 in rows 1-3 on right, then extend right by 3 columns of bg and place 1s in the "k" row— this is a very narrow fix for one incomplete frame type, easy to miss or overapply.
 * Padding to 5 rows: center vertically with bg rows if <5, truncate center if >5; widths preserved but concatenated horizontally.
 * Ordering: sort by minimum row index of component (descending/reverse, so topmost first?), then extend each output row by appending the processed subgrid's row.
 * Subtleties: Components may overlap in projection but are processed separately; output must be exactly 5 rows, even if empty (all bg or []); handle empty grids gracefully; protrusion trims can loop and chain (e.g., pending state across iterations); no rotation/flipping; assumes grid is rectangular; potential for multiple components per "symbol" but code treats each >=10 separately.
 * Easy-to-miss: Trimming doesn't handle top/bottom protrusions explicitly (only left/right); special frame adds fixed 3 columns, which may not generalize; concatenation assumes all subgrids same height post-pad (5), but widths vary; bg padding must match subgrid width; component finding uses DFS/stack, which is fine but must mark visited to avoid overlap.
 * General: Puzzle likely renders "text" or "symbols" via these objects; failures often from over-trimming/under-trimming or wrong ordering, leading to shape distortions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Extracts connected components of non-bg cells (4-dir) with size >=10 using DFS/stack and visited matrix.
    # Useful for isolating objects; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Works well as core extraction step.
```

```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Computes tight bounding box subgrid for a component, slicing original grid.
    # Essential for isolating each object without extra bg.
```

```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or truncates to exactly 5 rows, centering with bg rows; preserves width.
    # Helpful for standardization, but note: if h>5, it crops center—may lose top/bot details if asymmetric.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Trims pure-bg columns from left/right (vertical strips).
    # Basic but useful; doesn't handle top/bottom explicitly (could be added).
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def trim_left_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Heuristic trim based on left column diversity (e.g., <=3 uniq with 4; pending for 1; single 8).
    # Broken: over-trims or under-trims specific shapes, causing distortions (e.g., leaves artifacts in train1).
```

```python
def trim_right_protrusions(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Similar heuristic for right (with 5/3/8).
    # Broken: inconsistent with left, misses cases, leads to asymmetric shapes.
```

```python
def special_complete_frame(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Narrow rule to add 3 bg columns + 1s in one row for specific 5-high frame.
    # Unhelpful: too specific (only triggers on exact left uniform + right patterns with single 4); doesn't apply broadly and may add wrong elements.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, bounding/extracting them, basic bg trimming, and padding/concatenation framework.
 * What worked: Component detection and basic structure (e.g., outputs are always 5 rows; finds non-bg blobs >=10); ordering by min_row (reverse) seems to place top objects first; handles empty cases.
 * What didn't: Protrusion trims are flawed heuristics, leading to incomplete cleaning (e.g., leaves extra 8s or distorts shapes); special frame doesn't trigger or fix relevant cases; no top/bottom trimming, causing height issues pre-pad; concatenation works but with dirty subgrids, so overall output polluted.
 * Train1: Generated mismatches expected in rows 1/3—has [6,1,1,8,8,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,...], indicating failed left trim (left object not fully cleaned to 1s, left 8s as bg or protrusion); symmetric top/bot rows match, middle row2 correct, right parts ok—suggests partial trim success but missed inner details (unknown why exactly, perhaps pending state bug or wrong uniqueness check).
 * Train2: Generated is ~5x14 but wrong structure/content (e.g., starts with [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs expected much longer ~5x22 with different ordering/layout); likely missed multiple components or wrong bounding/trim (e.g., didn't extract separate left/center/right objects fully; protrusion rules over-trimmed or concatenated prematurely); expected has repeated 4s/1s patterns suggesting multiple padded symbols, but generated merges/distorts them.
 * Overall: Core extraction good, but cleaning/processing steps brittle—leads to shape errors; no handling for vertical protrusions or general symmetry enforcement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with irregular patterns (e.g., row0 has mixed 1/6/3/7/8; row2/3/4 show vertical stacks of 3/8/6/1/7/9), but it does not look correct—likely over-concatenated or under-trimmed multiple components without proper cleaning, resulting in a "smeared" look (e.g., long horizontal runs of same numbers suggest untrimmed bg or protrusions bleeding across symbols; vertical alignments like 3-8-3-3-3 in col0 imply stacked but uncleaned objects).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Without ground truth, but based on trains, it should be cleaner, separated symbols (e.g., distinct blocks of 1-9 patterns padded to 5-high, no excessive 8s as apparent bg leaks); here, it seems to have extracted ~4-5 components but failed trims (e.g., 8s in row1 col1-8 look like untrimmed right protrusion from a left symbol; 9s in row1/2 col20-22 may be a partial object). This doesn't make sense as a final "rendered" puzzle output—too noisy and asymmetric compared to train expecteds' structured, symmetric symbol rows; probably needs better left/right trim rules and top/bottom handling to isolate clean 5-high blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of integers representing shapes or blobs on a background, and the goal is to extract large connected components (non-background cells), process them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, handle special shape completions, pad to exactly 5 rows, sort them by their topmost row position (descending), and concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid. The output represents an arranged view of cleaned-up shapes, likely for identification or matching in a larger puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells (background is the value at g[0][0]), but only keep those with 10 or more cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for components; diagonals do not count.
 * Extract the minimal bounding subgrid for each component, then trim outer pure-background columns from all sides.
 * Trim left protrusions specifically: look for columns with full-height non-background where set includes 4 and <=3 unique values, or follow-up full-height {1} or sparse {1}; similar for right with 5 instead of 4; this seems to remove "antennae" or irregular extensions based on specific numbers like 4/5 (possibly denoting edges) and 1 (possibly a connector or filler).
 * Special handling for 5-row-high subgrids: if left column is uniform non-background C, right column has matching top/bottom D != C/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows on right, then append a copy of column 1 (second column) as new column 3 and a mostly-bg column 4 with 1 at the 4's row— this appears to "complete" an incomplete shape, but only if conditions match exactly.
 * Pad subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible; if over 5 rows, crop center 5.
 * Sort processed components by their minimum row index (top position) in descending order (topmost first), then horizontally concatenate their padded rows into the output; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming must preserve shape integrity—over-trimming can remove essential parts; special completion assumes exact 5-height and specific patterns, which may not always apply.
 * Output must match expected lengths and values exactly; mismatches often come from incorrect trimming (leaving extra bg or protrusions), wrong sorting/ordering of components, or failing to filter small components.
 * Background value varies per grid (always g[0][0]), and numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 likely represent colors, labels, or shape types that must be preserved.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming uses a "pending" state to chain trims (e.g., after detecting 4/5, allow subsequent {1} columns); without this, partial trims occur.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by top row, vertical alignment is implicit.
 * If subgrid width becomes 0 after trimming, skip it entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and last) submission shown; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding boxes, basic bg trimming, and padding/sorting logic.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS seems solid (finds blobs >=10); bounding subgrid extraction isolates shapes accurately; vertical padding to 5 rows standardizes output; sorting by min row descending and horizontal concat handles arrangement.
 * What didn't work: Trimming functions (outer_bg, left/right protrusions) are incomplete or buggy— in train 1, generated rows have extra elements (e.g., row 0: 14 elems vs expected 12, with extra 8's; row 1: extra 1,8,8 and misplaced 2's/3's); protrusions not fully removed, leaving bg or filler 1's/8's.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated includes extra 1's and 8's in middle (e.g., row1 has [6,1,1,1,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]—extra 1,8,8, and lengths differ by 2); row2 has extra 1,1,1,1,1 vs expected cleaner [6,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3]; symmetric rows duplicated incorrectly; unknown reason for extras, possibly over-retention in trimming or special_complete_shape adding wrong columns.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Severe—generated rows much longer (e.g., row0: 23 elems vs expected 22), with misplaced 6's/4's/1's at start ( [4,6,6,6,4,...] vs [4,4,4,4,...] ); components seem extracted but not trimmed/sorted right, leading to duplicated or shifted shapes (e.g., 5,3,5 patterns appear early but expected later); protrusions like left 4's/6's not handled, causing overlap or extras.
 * Special_complete_shape likely unhelpful—may be adding phantom columns in train 1 (extras around 8's/1's).
 * Overall, core extraction works, but processing (trimming/special) fails to clean shapes, leading to polluted outputs; no small components included (good), but large ones not refined properly.
 * Function trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but only does columns—may need row trimming for full cleanup.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as the program failed both training examples with similar trimming/processing errors (extras, length mismatches, misplaced values), suggesting it would mishandle test's complex grid similarly.
 * Issues: Rows have varying lengths (e.g., row0: 34 elems, but inconsistent patterns like clustered 3's/1's/6's/4's/7's/8's/9's suggest untrimmed protrusions or incomplete component isolation; e.g., repeated 3's and 8's look like retained bg or partial shapes.
 * Missing expected cleanliness: Expected output should have distinct, trimmed shapes concatenated without extras (e.g., no long runs of 8's/bg if trimmed right); here, dense 3's/8's/9's indicate over-retention, and values like 7/9 may be from unprocessed parts.
 * Does not make sense: Patterns like vertical 3's on left and scattered 1's/4's/6's suggest multiple components concatenated but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left columns have full-height 3's that might be protrusions per rules); special shapes not completed properly, leading to asymmetric or incomplete blobs; overall too noisy compared to cleaner expected trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected non-background components (objects or "blobs") must be extracted, trimmed to remove backgrounds and irregular protrusions, potentially modified with special rules (like completing frames), padded to exactly 5 rows, and then concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, sorted by the objects' original topmost row position in descending order (top-to-bottom priority).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the top-left cell value (e.g., 6 in train1, 4 in train2 expected); all processing treats cells != bg as part of objects.
 * Only components with >=10 connected cells (4-directional adjacency: up/down/left/right) are considered "large" and extracted; smaller ones are ignored.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes around components, then trims outer full-bg columns.
 * Trimming protrusions is asymmetric and rule-based: left side trims columns with <=3 non-bg cells containing 4 or 5, or full columns of 8; enters "pending" mode for follow-up {1,8}-only columns; right side similar but focused on 5 and 8, without the 4 condition.
 * Special rule: For 5-row subgrids, if left column is uniform non-bg color (except bg), and right has specific pattern (top/bottom matching non-bg, not equal to left color, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3), append 3 bg-padded cells with a 1 in the row matching the 4's position— this seems to "complete" an incomplete frame but is very narrow and may over-apply or miss.
 * Padding: Center-pad or crop to exactly 5 rows with bg; if >5 rows, crop from middle; if <5, symmetric bg rows top/bottom.
 * Final output: Sort extracted/padded subgrids by min_row descending (top objects first), concatenate rows horizontally; if no objects, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Trimming must preserve object integrity (e.g., don't remove core shapes); special frame only for exact 5-high cases and may add width unexpectedly; sorting ensures vertical order but assumes non-overlapping components; connected components must ignore bg strictly; potential for multiple objects per row or stacked vertically; outputs retain original colors (1-9 likely represent shapes/colors); easy to miss: protrusion rules are color-specific (e.g., 1,4,5,8) and stateful (pending flag), leading to over/under-trimming; bounding box may include extra bg if not trimmed fully; no vertical trimming mentioned, so heights vary before padding.
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to handle asymmetric shapes (e.g., protrusions only on sides); verify component size threshold (10 may be too high/low for some); special rules might be over-generalized or buggy (e.g., applies when not needed); concatenation assumes fixed 5 rows but variable widths; test for overlapping components or bg enclaves inside objects (current flood-fill ignores inner bg holes).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it demonstrates partial understanding by correctly identifying large components, extracting bounding subgrids, and applying basic trimming/padding/concatenation/sorting.
 * What worked: Component detection via flood-fill is solid (finds non-bg blobs >=10 cells); bounding extraction and outer bg trim work for isolating rough shapes; padding to 5 rows ensures output format; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftward correctly in principle; for train1, the overall structure (e.g., three objects concatenated) is right, and colors mostly match except specific trim failures.
 * What didn't work: Protrusion trimming is incomplete/buggy— in train1, left trim failed to remove a bg column inside the first object, leaving extra 8s instead of connecting 1s (generated row1/3: 1,1,8,... vs expected 1,1,1,...; specific diff: positions 3-4 in first object have 8 where 1 expected, suggesting missed inner bg strip); right trim similar issues; special_complete_frame didn't trigger or apply correctly (no added elements visible, but may not have been needed); for train2, entire output is wrong—generated has wrong widths/heights, misplaced colors (e.g., long 4/6 runs at edges, but expected has reoriented/trimmed objects with different concatenation order/positions like 1,2,1 in row2 vs generated 3,5,6); unknown why train2 objects weren't isolated cleanly (possibly over-trimming or wrong component detection, e.g., merged separate blobs); component size threshold (10) may exclude/include wrongly; no vertical trimming, leading to uneven handling; special frame function is narrow (only 5-high, specific patterns) and likely unhelpful/broken for general cases (doesn't apply in examples but could add spurious width); trim_left/right_protrusions are overly complex/stateful and error-prone (pending logic fails on color sets like {4,5} not propagating correctly, leading to partial trims).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_large_components serves similar role and is essential; overall, attempt shows core extraction/sorting but fails on precise trimming, causing shape distortions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as a messy, wide concatenation (32 cols) with irregular patterns (e.g., scattered 1-9, long 3/8/6 runs, apparent merged blobs like vertical 3s and 4s), but lacks clean isolated objects—e.g., row0 has clustered 1,3,7,4,6 but no clear trimmed shapes; compared to train examples, expected outputs have symmetric/padded objects (e.g., train1 has clean 1/4/1 frames with 8 bg), while this has no obvious bg padding or frames, suggesting over-merging components or failed trims (e.g., untrimmed protrusions like the 7s/8s clusters); widths don't align with expected object isolation (too many cols for 3-4 objects); colors like repeated 3/6/8 indicate possible wrong bg detection or inclusion of small components; it does not match a mentally simulated correct output, which should have 3-5 trimmed 5-row objects (e.g., a left blob with 2/4/3, middle with 1/7/8 frame, right with 6/9/3) concatenated cleanly with bg spaces, but this seems to include extraneous connections (e.g., the 7 in row2/3 connects what should be separate).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to identify, extract, and standardize "objects" (connected non-background components of size >=10) from an input grid of integers (representing pixel colors/labels), then trim them according to specific protrusion and special rules, pad/crop to exactly 5 rows, and horizontally concatenate them in vertical order (top-to-bottom based on minimum row index) into a fixed 5-row output grid, preserving the background value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the value at g[0][0]; all processing ignores or trims pure bg areas.
 * Connected components use 4-directional adjacency (up/down/left/right); only include cells != bg; must be size >=10 to qualify as an "object".
 * Bounding subgrid extracts the minimal rectangle around a component, but does not initially trim top/bottom (only left/right outer bg columns in trim_outer_bg).
 * Trimming is asymmetric and rule-based: trim_outer_bg removes full left/right columns of bg; trim_left_protrusions uses complex heuristics (e.g., column sets with <=3 types including 4, or "pending" counts of 1's, or single 8) to remove left "protrusions" iteratively; trim_right_protrusions is simpler (e.g., <=2 types including 5, or single 8).
 * apply_special is a niche rule: only for exactly 5-row subgrids with uniform non-bg left column L, right column with matching top/bottom !=bg !=L, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3 of right column; appends two new columns with a single 1 in the row matching the 4's position, rest bg— this seems to "fill" or "correct" specific shapes like incomplete letters/symbols.
 * Padding/cropping to 5 rows: if <5 rows, center-pad with bg rows (top/bottom); if >5, crop to middle 5 rows (not top or bottom aligned); no horizontal padding mentioned, but output is concatenated directly.
 * Output ordering: Sort objects by descending min_row (topmost first), then extend each output row by appending the corresponding row from each processed object horizontally.
 * Subtleties: Trimming rules are heuristic and color-specific (e.g., favoring 1,4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle encodes symbols/letters where certain numbers represent strokes (e.g., 1 for lines, 4/5/8 for curves/hooks); over-trimming can remove valid parts (e.g., turning 1's into 8's/bg); under-trimming leaves protrusions; special rule only triggers on exact 5-high; no rotation/reflection; empty input yields 5 empty rows; components may overlap in horizontal space but are processed independently; output lengths vary based on object widths post-trimming.
 * Easy-to-miss: Top/bottom trimming is absent in current code (only left/right), leading to untrimmed vertical bg; pending_count in left trim is a stateful counter for sequences of 1's, but resets unclearly; right trim lacks pending logic; sorting by -min_r places top objects leftmost, but if min_r ties, order is arbitrary (not specified); generated outputs show length mismatches, indicating width calculation errors post-trimming.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction and horizontal concatenation but fails on trimming and special rules.
 * find_large_components works well (correctly identifies qualifying objects in train1, as shapes are mostly preserved).
 * trim_outer_bg is partially helpful but incomplete (only handles left/right columns, misses top/bottom full bg rows, leading to potential vertical artifacts).
 * trim_left_protrusions is over-aggressive or miscalibrated: in train1, it incorrectly trims columns containing 1's (replacing them with 8/bg), e.g., row1/4 have 8 where expected 1 (missing third 1 in left object); pending_count logic for 1's seems buggy (resets to non_bg.count(1) but decrements without clear init/reset per object).
 * trim_right_protrusions underperforms in train2: fails to align or trim right-side objects properly, resulting in mismatched widths/positions (e.g., generated has 21+ cols per row vs expected 22, with 4's and 6's shifted left).
 * apply_special did not trigger in train1 (expected no change, but trimming issue masked it); unclear if it fired in train2, but output suggests special "filling" (e.g., extra 1's) was missed.
 * pad_to_5_rows works for vertical standardization but inherits trimming errors; in train2, middle-cropping >5 row objects may have cut key parts.
 * Overall in train1: Left object trimming wrong (generated row1: [6,1,1,8,...] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,...]; same for row4; row2/3 correct), right objects intact; lengths match but content differs by one column of 8->1.
 * Overall in train2: Major misalignment—generated starts with left-heavy 4/6/1 blocks out of order (e.g., row1 has [4,6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1] vs expected [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...1,1,1,1]); objects concatenated wrong (e.g., 5/3/6 blocks shifted, missing 8's in expected right); lengths similar but positions/contents jumbled, suggesting sort or bounding error.
 * Sorting by -min_r works directionally but may fail on tied min_r or if min_r calc ignores trims.
 * No top/bottom trim function, leading to potential unhandled vertical protrusions (unobserved in trains but likely in test).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It's a 5x27 grid (very wide), with jumbled, asymmetric shapes (e.g., row0 has scattered 3/1/6/7/8/9, row2 has dense 3/8/1/7/6/9 blocks) that don't form coherent "symbols" like in trains (e.g., no clear letter-like clusters post-trim); lengths are inconsistent across rows? No, all 27, but visually messy with repeating 3/8 patterns suggesting under-trimmed protrusions or wrong component merging.
 * Compared to trains, it over-concatenates (27 cols vs train1's 12, train2's ~22), implying too many/large objects extracted or widths not trimmed (e.g., long horizontal 3/8 runs in row1/4 look like untrimmed bg-adjacent lines).
 * Missing expected "clean" separation: e.g., row2 has [4,3,8,3,...] starting with 4 (possibly a special case), but no obvious padding or filling; likely trimming failed (left/right rules didn't handle 3/6/7/9 mixes), and ordering placed bottom objects left (if min_r sort inverted).
 * Does not make sense as a puzzle solution—appears raw/unprocessed grid dump rather than standardized 5-row symbols; probably extracts extra small components or skips size check; unknown why so many 3/8/9 but no 2/4/5 balance like trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where large connected components (non-background cells) are extracted from an input grid, trimmed and modified according to specific rules to form subgrids, padded to exactly 5 rows, sorted by their bottom-most position, and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, while ignoring small components and background (bg) elements. The goal is to isolate and refine "objects" or "shapes" in the grid to match expected clean, compact representations without extraneous artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the value at g[0][0], and components are 4-way connected groups of non-bg cells; only components with more than 10 cells are processed to avoid noise or small artifacts.
 * Extract bounding subgrid for each component, then trim full outer bg columns (left/right) that span all rows.
 * Trim left protrusions iteratively: remove leftmost column if it's all bg, or if non-bg cells have <=3 unique values including 4, or exactly one unique value which is 8; this targets irregular extensions on the left side.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with stricter conditions: remove rightmost column if all bg, or non-bg has <=2 unique including 5, or single 8; this handles asymmetric right-side irregularities.
 * Special completion applies only to 5-row subgrids with width >=3: if left column is all the same non-bg value L (no bg mixed in), and right column has matching top/bottom non-bg non-L values, exactly one 4 in rows 1-3, then duplicate the penultimate column, append two full bg columns, and place 1's in the new columns at the row index of the single 4—this seems to "complete" incomplete shapes like adding symmetric elements or holes.
 * Pad subgrids to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering if too tall (trim to 5) or adding symmetric bg rows if short; if after processing a subgrid is empty, skip it.
 * Sort processed subgrids by descending min row index (bottom-first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; if no valid components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtle: Trimming is iterative and column-specific, so order matters (trim outer bg first, then protrusions); special completion can widen the subgrid unexpectedly, potentially adding columns that need further consideration.
 * Components may overlap in columns but are processed separately; concatenation extends rows horizontally without vertical stacking.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion rules are asymmetric (left tolerates more variety with 4, right stricter with 5), and special completion requires exact conditions (e.g., no bg in left, exactly one 4 on right middle)—mismatches here can leave artifacts.
 * Handle empty/edge cases: zero rows/cols return empty 5x0; bg=8 in some examples but varies (e.g., 6 in train1).
 * Output must match expected length and values exactly; extra/duplicated cells indicate over-processing or failed trimming.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt processes multiple large components (>10 cells) separately, trims them, applies special rules, pads to 5 rows, sorts bottom-first, and concatenates horizontally, which captures the core structure but fails on training examples due to over-inclusion or failed trimming.
 * Train 1 (bg=6?): Generated output has 15 columns per row vs. expected 12; it duplicates middle sections (e.g., [1,8,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,...] appears symmetric but with extra 8's and 1's not in expected [1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]); likely protrusion trimming didn't remove enough, or special completion misapplied, leaving artifacts like extra 8's around the 9 and in the middle blob.
 * Train 1 also shows top/bottom rows with extra 8's after the 9 (e.g., generated [6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] vs. expected [6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]), suggesting outer trim or padding failed to compact.
 * Train 2 (bg=4?): Generated has 21 columns vs. expected 22, but mismatched positions (e.g., generated row 0 starts [4,6,6,6,4,...] and includes misplaced 1's/3's/5's early, while expected shifts elements rightward with 4's filling left and 8's in specific spots); concatenation order or component bounding seems wrong, as it didn't align the 6's and 3's properly, and protrusion rules may have over-trimmed right side (missing some 8's).
 * Train 2 generated symmetric but bloated rows (e.g., row 2 has [3,5,3,6,6,1,2,1,3,3,...] vs. expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] starting later), indicating multiple components concatenated out of order or without proper left-trim for the key shape.
 * Overall, what worked: Component detection and basic bounding/padding seem functional (outputs are 5 rows, non-empty for valid inputs); sorting by minr descending places bottom objects first.
 * What didn't: Trimming protrusions is too aggressive or condition-mismatched (e.g., left trim removes too much variety, failing on sets without 4); special completion likely not triggering correctly (no evidence of added 1's in outputs); multi-component handling concatenates extras instead of selecting/isolating the main object(s); no vertical trimming beyond padding, so tall components may bloat.
 * The main program function is helpful as a skeleton but needs refined conditions in trims and better component filtering (e.g., perhaps merge overlapping or select only the largest).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all provided (find_components, bounding, trims, special, pad) are relevant, though trim conditions are buggy/subtly wrong for these cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (5 rows, ~27 columns each) does not look correct; it appears as a single bloated concatenation without clear object separation (e.g., row 0 mixes 3's,1's,6's,7's,8's irregularly like [3,1,6,1,3,3,3,1,7,1,4,1,7,8,6,6,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,6,6], suggesting multiple untrimmed components smashed together without proper bounding or protrusion removal.
 * It lacks compactness—expected should be shorter, cleaner subgrids (e.g., trimmed to remove bg=3? protrusions, with special completion if applicable), but this has repeating 3's/8's/6's that look like unprocessed edges or failed trims (e.g., long runs of 3's on right in row 0, mismatched with row 4's 8's/1's/3's).
 * No obvious special completion effects (e.g., no added 1's in bg columns), and the irregularity (e.g., row 2 has isolated 9's and 7's not aligned across rows) suggests the program over-concatenated small/large components or skipped size filter inconsistently; it doesn't resemble a refined puzzle output and likely fails if expected is a simple 5x12-15 grid like training.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected "objects" (non-background components) from a 2D grid, processing them by trimming backgrounds and protrusions, applying special rules for completion or adjustment, padding to a fixed 5-row height, and then horizontally concatenating them in vertical order (top-to-bottom) to form a new 5-row output grid representing the arranged puzzle solution.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is detected as the top-left cell value (often 8), and objects are 4-way connected non-bg cells with size >=10; smaller components are ignored.
 * Extract bounding boxes for each large component, then trim outer full-bg columns and rows to isolate the object tightly.
 * Subtle protrusion trims: Remove left columns if they are all bg or have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 (suggesting a "handle" or artifact); similarly for right columns but checking for 5 instead of 4— this seems asymmetric and potentially buggy for certain shapes.
 * Special completion rule only for exact 5-row subgrids: If left column has exactly one unique non-bg value L, and right column has matching top/bottom non-bg (not bg or L), with exactly one 4 in rows 1-3, duplicate the penultimate column and add two bg columns, then place 1's in specific positions based on the 4's row— this appears to "complete" incomplete shapes but is overly specific and may not trigger correctly.
 * After all trims and special rules, pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering if needed; if height >5, crop to center 5 rows.
 * Concatenate processed objects horizontally in order of decreasing max row index (topmost first), extending each of the 5 output rows; empty or all-bg objects are skipped.
 * Outputs must match exact lengths and values per row; mismatches often from over-trimming (losing parts), under-trimming (extra bg), wrong sorting/order, or special rule misapplication leading to added/duplicated cells.
 * Grids may have multiple objects; order matters (top-to-bottom), and no vertical stacking— all side-by-side in one 5-row canvas.
 * Subtleties: Protrusion rules might remove valid parts if sets include wrong numbers (e.g., len(s)<=3 and 4/5 present); special completion adds cells only under strict conditions, potentially missing "incomplete" objects; trimming after special completion can re-remove added parts; background assumption (top-left) fails if grid is empty or malformed.
 * Easy to miss: Components must be exactly >=10 cells; 4-way connectivity only (no diagonals); after all processing, if subgrid becomes empty, skip it; output rows may vary in length if objects have different widths, but expected often has uniform or specific lengths without trailing bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background, finds large (>=10 cell) 4-way components, extracts bounding subgrids, and pads to 5 rows, but fails in trimming and special processing, leading to incorrect shapes and lengths in outputs.
 * Train 1 generated output has extra 8's (bg) inserted in rows 1-3 (e.g., row1: [6,1,1,1,8,8,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3] vs expected [6,1,1,1,8,8,2,8,2,3,3,3]— extras at positions ~6-8 and 10-11, and row2 has 1,4,1,1,1,1 vs expected 1,4,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,3 with misplaced 2's/3's; row0/4 longer by 3 bg's)— likely from protrusion trims removing too little or special completion not applying, causing misaligned concatenation.
 * Train 2 generated output is much longer and jumbled (e.g., row0 starts [4,6,6,6,4,4,...1,1,1,1] vs expected [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,4,...1,1,1,1]— wrong order of objects, extra leading 6's, and row2 has 3,5,3,6,...4,4,1,4,4,1 vs expected 1,2,1,3,...8,4,4,1,4,4,1 with missing leading 1's/2's and extra 3's/5's)— suggests multiple components found but sorted/concatenated in wrong order (not purely by max_r descending) or over-trimming creating artifacts.
 * Sorting by -max_r (top-first) is present but may not handle ties or vertical overlaps correctly; concatenation extends rows without trimming trailing bg, leading to extra lengths.
 * Protrusion trim functions (trim_left_protrusions, trim_right_protrusions) are helpful in concept for removing artifacts but buggy— left checks for 4 in set, right for 5 (asymmetric, possibly wrong for puzzle); they loop to remove multiple columns but may strip valid parts if sets match criteria unexpectedly.
 * Special completion (apply_special_completion) is overly restrictive (requires h==5 pre-trim, exact one L on left, specific right column pattern with one 4)— didn't trigger in train1 (expected has a "completed" look with 2's/3's aligned), adding wrong cells or skipping when needed.
 * trim_outer_columns called twice (before/after protrusions) is redundant but helpful; however, row trim after special completion removes added bg, potentially undoing it.
 * Overall, core extraction works (components found), but processing chain (trims + special + pad + concat) introduces errors; no handling for diagonal connectivity or <10 components being valid in some cases.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are partially helpful but broken due to hardcoded 4/5 checks— adjust criteria or make symmetric; apply_special_completion is unhelpful as-is (too specific, doesn't fix train cases)— revise or remove.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears as five uneven rows with mixed numbers (1,3,6,7,8,9) in a jumbled, non-object-like arrangement (e.g., row0: [1,6,1,3,3,3,1,7,1,1,7,8,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,1,3,3] starts with scattered 1/3/6/7, suggesting multiple poorly trimmed objects concatenated without proper isolation).
 * Unlike training expecteds (clean, aligned shapes like borders of 6/8/9 or 4/1/3 patterns), this has no clear 5-row object boundaries— e.g., vertical stacks of 3's and 8's look like untrimmed grid remnants rather than extracted/padded items, with extras like repeated 6's/8's indicating over-inclusion of bg or wrong component merging.
 * Row lengths are ~26-28 but inconsistent in structure (e.g., row4 ends with many 3's, row2 has isolated 7/9's), vs. expecteds' tighter ~12-23 lengths with symmetric padding; likely protrusion trims failed to remove "handles" (e.g., the 7's might be artifacts), and special completion didn't apply to "fix" incomplete shapes like the 9's cluster.
 * No obvious top-to-bottom ordering (e.g., 9's in row1/3 suggest mid-level object not sorted correctly); output includes small clusters (<10 cells?) like isolated 7's, violating size filter— mentally, test input seems to have 3-4 large objects (e.g., 3/8 borders, 6/9 blocks, 1/7 protrusions), but output mashes them without cleaning, missing subtle rules like completing 4/5 patterns or symmetric trims.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and extract large connected non-background components (objects) from an input grid, trim and normalize them into 5-row subgrids, and then concatenate these processed subgrids horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, likely representing a reassembly or canonical representation of puzzle elements like shapes or icons. The background value is assumed to be the top-left cell's value, and components must meet size thresholds and trimming rules to qualify.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components of non-background cells using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); only include components with at least 10 cells to filter out small noise or irrelevant parts.
 * Extract a tight bounding subgrid for each qualifying component, then trim uniform background columns from the outer edges to isolate the object.
 * Apply specialized trimming for "protrusions": on the left, remove columns where all non-background cells are from a small set of values (≤3 unique values including 4, or single value 8, and full height non-bg); on the right, similar but stricter (≤2 unique including 5, full height non-bg)—these rules seem tailored to remove specific artifact-like extensions in puzzle objects without affecting core shapes.
 * Pad or crop subgrids to exactly 5 rows, centering them with background padding if shorter, or trimming from the middle if longer, to standardize height.
 * Sort processed objects by their minimum row index in descending order (topmost first) before horizontal concatenation into the output; this may prioritize vertical positioning but can lead to incorrect ordering if objects overlap or if sorting should instead be by leftmost column or another criterion.
 * Assume rectangular input grid; output must be exactly 5 rows, with empty lists if no valid components.
 * Subtle: Trimming rules are highly specific to digit values (e.g., 4,5,8), suggesting the puzzle uses numbered cells representing colors or types, and protrusions are puzzle-specific (e.g., stems or bars that shouldn't be part of the main object).
 * Components must exclude background entirely in connectivity checks; visited matrix prevents reprocessing.
 * If no components or after trimming an object becomes empty, skip it to avoid corrupting output.
 * Potential overlap: If components overlap in rows, concatenation may misalign visually; sorting by -minr places higher (smaller row index) objects first, but this failed in train2, suggesting order might need to be by average row, left position, or puzzle-specific priority (e.g., horizontals before verticals).
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying row lengths aren't handled (assume uniform); very tall objects get cropped centrally, which might lose key details; background is always g[0][0], assuming consistent.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, successfully extracted and concatenated components with proper trimming and sorting, producing exact match—demonstrates core component finding and padding work for simple cases.
 * Train2: Incorrect; generated output starts with symmetric vertical side objects (rows 0/4: [4,6,6,6,4,...] patterns) followed by middle, but expected starts with horizontal top/bottom bars ([4,4,4,...6,6,6,4,...]) then shifted middle rows—likely due to sorting by -minr placing side objects (higher minr?) first instead of horizontals, and/or protrusion trimming removing too much from horizontals or not enough from sides.
 * Trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but overly specific; in train2, left trim condition (ls<=3 with 4 or ls=1 with 8) may have failed to remove protrusions on horizontals, while right trim (ls<=2 with 5) might have over-trimmed sides, leading to mismatched widths and positions (generated has 23 cols per section?, expected has varying but aligned horizontals first).
 * Sorting by -minr (top-first) worked for train1 but failed train2, suggesting it doesn't handle multi-object vertical stacking or needs secondary sort by min col or size.
 * Concatenation extends rows horizontally without alignment or separators, which matched train1 but caused train2 to have misordered elements (e.g., generated row2 has [3,5,3,6,6,8,1,2,1,...] but expected [1,2,1,3,3,...] shifted right).
 * find_large_components is essential and correct (size>=10 filters properly), as is get_bounding_subgrid and pad_to_5_rows.
 * trim_outer_bg is basic but helpful; however, the protrusion trims are puzzle-specific and may be broken for cases with different digit patterns (e.g., if train2 has values outside 4,5,8 rules).
 * Overall, core extraction works (train1 pass), but ordering and trimming subtleties cause failures—unknown why generated train2 mirrors top/bottom but expected doesn't, possibly due to undetected components or wrong bg assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output concatenates several subgrids horizontally into 5 rows (widths ~34-36 per row, inconsistent?), showing patterns like left block with 3/4/2/1/6/7/8/9 digits forming potential objects (e.g., vertical stacks on left, denser middle with 8s and 6s), but it does not look correct because it appears to include all detected components without proper ordering or trimming—e.g., row0 starts [3,2,3,2,3,1,6,...] suggesting untrimmed protrusions or small components slipped through (size>=10 should filter, but maybe test has many large ones).
 * Compared to expected logic from train2, test output likely misorders objects (e.g., starts with what seems like a left-protruding shape instead of top horizontals), and widths vary slightly per row (e.g., row0 has 34 elems, row1 34, but parsing shows potential misalignment), indicating trimming failed to normalize.
 * Denser right side with 9s and 8s in rows1-4 suggests a large component was extracted but not protrusion-trimmed (e.g., left/right rules didn't trigger for 9-heavy columns), leading to bloated output; this doesn't match the clean, aligned expected from train2.
 * No empty output or skips, but over-inclusion (e.g., possible small objects or bg leaks) makes it incorrect—mentally, test grid has multiple blobs (left verticals, central 8/6 mass, right 9/3 area), but correct output should sort/trim to ~3-4 clean 5-row objects concatenated, not this raw dump.
 * Subtleties missed: Test may have overlapping components or bg=3? (common value), causing find_large_components to merge or skip; generated has repeated 3/8/6 patterns but no clear horizontal-first order.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where large connected non-background components (likely representing objects or shapes) are identified, extracted into bounding subgrids, cleaned of backgrounds and protrusions, padded to exactly 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in descending order of their topmost row position to form a composite output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify components as 4-connected groups of non-background cells with at least 10 cells to filter out noise/small artifacts.
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing excludes it.
 * Extract tight bounding subgrids for each component to isolate shapes.
 * Trim outer full-background columns from the subgrid to remove padding around the entire object.
 * Trim left protrusions conditionally: look for full-height columns with specific values (e.g., 4 triggering pending state, then 1 in sparse/full columns); this seems heuristic for removing "stems" or attachments but may over-trim or under-trim based on value patterns.
 * Trim right protrusions similarly but with different heuristics (e.g., columns with 5 and limited unique values <=2, full or sparse); this appears asymmetric and tailored to specific shapes but risks incorrect cuts.
 * Pad vertically to exactly 5 rows with background, centering if possible, or cropping if taller (though cropping isn't explicitly handled beyond start offset).
 * Sort components by minimum row (top position) descending, so higher-up objects appear leftmost in the output.
 * Output is always 5 rows, with empty/zero-width rows if no components; concatenate subgrids horizontally without separators.
 * Subtle: Protrusion trimming relies on value-specific rules (e.g., 4,1 on left; 5 on right), suggesting the puzzle uses numeric labels for shape parts (e.g., digits as pixel values); mismatches here cause misalignment.
 * Handle empty grids or no large components by returning 5 empty lists.
 * Components may overlap in columns when concatenated, but since sorted by row, vertical alignment isn't enforced.
 * Easy to miss: Trimming must preserve core shape integrity; over-trimming shifts or loses elements (e.g., expected frames in training 2). Also, bounding subgrid includes only component cells but copies full grid values, so internal bg is preserved if present.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS/stack to find 4-connected components of non-bg cells >=10 size; returns list of cell lists per component.
    # Helpful for isolating objects; visited matrix prevents re-processing.
    # Directions: up, down, left, right only (no diagonals).
```
```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid bounding the component cells from the original grid.
    # Preserves original values (including internal bg or holes); essential for shape fidelity.
```
```python
def trim_outer_bg(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing full-bg columns across all rows; returns empty if fully bg.
    # Basic cleanup; works well for outer padding.
```
```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Pads or crops to exactly 5 rows with bg, centering vertically if short, or cropping from top if tall.
    # Handles height normalization; note: width unchanged, assumes sub is non-empty.
```
* trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions: Heuristic-based column removal for "protrusions" using value sets (e.g., full columns with 4 trigger left trim, pending for 1; right trims on 5 with <=2 uniques). Potentially helpful for specific shapes but buggy/unhelpful as-is (see below); value-specific and stateful (pending flag), easy to overgeneralize.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, indicating core component finding, bounding, outer trim, padding, and sorting by min-row descending work for simple cases.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated output shows symmetric top/bottom frames (rows 0/4 with 4-6-4 pattern) but misplaced middle content (e.g., row 1 starts with [5,3,5,6,6,...] instead of expected [1,1,1,4,4,...]; row 2 has [3,5,3,...] vs expected [1,2,1,3,...]). Differences: Components appear concatenated in wrong order/alignment (e.g., left frame duplicated/misplaced, inner shapes shifted right by ~10 columns, losing expected leading 1's and frame extensions). Likely due to faulty protrusion trimming (over-trimming left/right causes width shifts) or incorrect sorting (min-row not capturing vertical position accurately).
 * Overall: Component extraction and padding are solid, but trimming functions fail on complex shapes with specific values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,8), leading to shape distortion/misplacement. No handling for internal holes or non-rectangular alignments. Sorting by -minr places top objects left, which matches expected but fails if trims alter perceived position.
 * Function trim_left_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Pending state and value rules (4 full -> pending, then 1 sparse/full) over-trim in training 2, removing necessary left elements (e.g., expected leading 1's/4's lost). Don't use without refinement.
 * Function trim_right_protrusions is broken/not helpful: Rules (5 in <=2 uniques, full/sparse) under-trim or trim unevenly, causing right-side bloat/shift in generated vs expected (e.g., extra 4's/1's trailing). Avoid until value-agnostic or puzzle-specific fixes.
 * find_large_components and get_bounding_subgrid are essential and correct; reuse them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5 rows x ~34 cols) does not look correct; it appears to concatenate multiple components (e.g., left section with 3-2-3 patterns and 1-6-1, middle with 8-heavy blocks and 4-7-8, right with 3-9-3 and 6-8) but results in jagged, asymmetric shapes without clear object isolation (e.g., row 0 has irregular lengths, row 2 mixes 4-1-4 with 7-3-6).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Based on training 2 failure, likely over-trims protrusions (e.g., left 3-4-4 columns may be incorrectly cut, shifting 8-blocks and 9's rightward); output has no symmetric framing like training 2 expected, and values like 7-8-6-9 suggest untrimmed artifacts or wrong component selection (e.g., including small/sparse groups despite >=10 rule). Doesn't match puzzle's apparent need for clean, horizontally aligned 5-row objects (e.g., missing padding consistency, possible unsorted order causing overlap).
 * Why not correct: Resembles raw concatenation without proper trimming (e.g., excessive 3-8-3 vertical lines suggest untrimmed bg edges; 9's clustered but not bounded tightly). Fails to produce expected "clean extract" like training 1; mentally, test grid seems to have distinct blobs (e.g., a frame-like left object, central 8-filled shape, right 6-9 cluster), but output mangles them into a single messy row without vertical alignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-processing puzzle where large non-background connected components (representing "objects" or shapes) are extracted from an input grid, normalized through bounding, trimming protrusions and backgrounds, optional special completions for specific patterns, and padding to exactly 5 rows, then concatenated horizontally in top-to-bottom order to form a final 5-row output grid. The goal is to clean and arrange these objects to match an expected composite image, likely for a rebus or shape-based riddle.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify background as the value at g[0][0] and only process components of size >=10 cells to filter out noise or small artifacts.
 * Use 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) for flood-fill to find components; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.
 * Bounding subgrid must tightly crop around the component's min/max rows/cols, but subsequent trims handle outer pure-bg columns.
 * Trimming outer bg removes full columns of bg on left/right, but only after bounding; if trimming empties the subgrid, handle gracefully (e.g., return empty rows).
 * Left protrusion trim: Iteratively remove leftmost column if non-bg cells are few (<=3 unique values including 4) or single value 1; this targets irregular "stubs" without removing core shape.
 * Right protrusion trim: Similar to left but checks for 5 in non-bg or single 1; asymmetric conditions suggest puzzle shapes have direction-specific irregularities (e.g., 4 on left, 5 on right as markers).
 * Special complete: Only for exactly 5-row subgrids; checks uniform non-bg left column (L), uniform top/bottom right column (R != bg, !=L), exactly one 4 in middle right positions (rows 1-3), then appends duplicated penultimate column, followed by two columns with 1 at the 4's row position and bg elsewhere—this seems to "fill" or symmetrize specific incomplete shapes like letters or symbols.
 * Padding: Center to 5 rows with bg if <5 (symmetric top/bottom), or crop center 5 if >5; preserves width per row.
 * Sorting: Process components by min row descending (top-first), concatenate by extending each output row with the processed sub-row; if no components, return 5 empty rows.
 * Subtleties: Assumes all objects fit in 5 rows post-pad; special complete adds width (duplicates +2 cols), which may be key for train2 mismatch; protrusion trims are iterative but stop at w<=1; non-bg uniqueness checks (sets) ignore bg but count only non-bg variety.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5 empty rows; components touching edge may need no extra bg trim; multiple components per "level" aren't handled (all concatenated flatly, but sorting by minr groups vertically).
 * Potential misses: Over-trimming core shape (e.g., if protrusion conditions hit main body); special complete not triggering when it should (e.g., row count exactly 5 pre-pad); concatenation order assumes no overlaps, but visual alignment might require spacing (not implemented).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; training example 1 passed correctly, indicating core component extraction, bounding, basic trimming, and concatenation work for simple cases.
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output is a near-mirror symmetric 5x21 grid with repeated 4/6 blocks on sides, internal 1/3/5/8 patterns, but lacks the expected framing 1's on left/right edges, has mismatched internal placements (e.g., 2 and 3's shifted, extra 8's), and shorter widths per row (21 vs expected 22); top/bottom rows identical in generated but expected has extended 1's.
 * What worked: Large component detection (>=10) and vertical sorting by minr correctly isolated objects; padding to 5 rows preserved shapes in train1.
 * What didn't: For train2, protrusion trims likely over-removed or misapplied (e.g., conditions hit core instead of stubs, removing necessary 1's for framing); special_complete probably didn't trigger or added incorrectly, leading to asymmetric/missing fills (expected has more 1's and structured 3/4/5 blocks); concatenation extended rows unevenly, causing width mismatch.
 * trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions are helpful but brittle—conditions (e.g., 4/5 presence) may false-positive on complex shapes; unhelpful if shapes have >3 unique non-bg in protrusions.
 * special_complete is key for train2-like cases but overly restrictive (e.g., requires exact uniform left/right, single middle 4); didn't activate properly, missing the expected "completion" of partial symbols.
 * Overall program structure (process -> sort -> concat) is solid but fails on subtleties like exact trim conditions and special patterns, leading to distorted objects in composite.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x25 grid with dense, irregular patterns (e.g., row0: 3,6,1,3's then 7,4,8,6's; heavy 3/8/6/9 clusters, some 1/7/4 accents), but it looks incorrect—appears over-trimmed or uncompleted, with jagged edges (e.g., varying densities of 3's and 8's suggest untrimmed protrusions or missed special fills) and no clear framing/separation between potential objects, unlike expected structured composites in train2.
 * Doesn't make sense visually: Lacks symmetry or clean shapes (e.g., row2 has isolated 4,8,3 then 7,3,6's; row4 has long 8's then 1,3's), probably from failing to trim properly (e.g., left/right conditions not catching 9's or 7's as protrusions) or special_complete not applying to 5-row objects, resulting in concatenated mess instead of normalized symbols.
 * Compared to train2 failure, similar issues: Missing expected 1-framing and block alignments; widths consistent (25 cols) but content mismatched (e.g., no evident top/bottom mirroring or 4/5 completions); to fix, need broader trim conditions (e.g., include 7/9 in checks) and debug special_complete triggers for test's denser grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers to identify, extract, and refine large connected non-background components (objects) into a standardized 5-row output format, where objects are trimmed of backgrounds and protrusions, potentially completed with special rules, padded vertically to 5 rows, and concatenated horizontally in reverse row-order priority. The goal is to produce a clean, concatenated representation of these processed objects, likely for a visual puzzle like assembling icons or symbols from a cluttered grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg cells as part of objects.
 * Only components with 10 or more cells are considered "large" and extracted; smaller ones are ignored.
 * Objects are extracted as subgrids based on bounding boxes, then trimmed: remove outer full-bg columns/rows, and iteratively trim left/right columns that are mostly bg or simple protrusions (e.g., sets of <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 on left or 5 on right, or single 1).
 * Special completion rule applies only to 5-row subgrids: if left column is uniform non-bg (L), right column has mismatched top/bottom not equal to L/bg, exactly one 4 in middle rows (1-3), append columns to extend rightward with bg and insert 1's at the 4's row position.
 * Padding centers subgrids vertically to exactly 5 rows with bg; if >5 rows, crop to central 5.
 * Processed objects are sorted by min_r descending (top-to-bottom reversed) and concatenated horizontally into a single 5-row grid.
 * Subtle: Trimming must be sequential (columns then rows then protrusions) to avoid over-trimming; special completion can extend width dynamically.
 * Components must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right, no diagonals).
 * Output rows can vary in length if no objects, but defaults to empty 5 rows; concatenation preserves all processed widths without further alignment.
 * Easy to miss: Protrusion trimming conditions are asymmetric (left checks for 4, right for 5) and allow single-1 columns; special completion requires exact 5 rows pre-padding and specific right-column patterns.
 * If multiple objects, order by reverse min_r ensures "higher" (smaller row index) objects appear rightmost in output.
 * Grids may have varying sizes, but output is always 5 rows; empty or all-bg grids return 5 empty rows.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: CORRECT - Successfully extracted, trimmed, and concatenated objects into the expected 5-row format, demonstrating core component finding, bounding, trimming, and ordering work for simple cases.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT - Generated output has symmetric top/bottom rows with [4,6,6,6,4...] starting each, middle rows with mismatched patterns like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] and [3,5,3,6,6,8,...], and shorter lengths (~21 cols/row); expected has asymmetric structure with longer rows (~22 cols), top/bottom [4,4,4,...6,6,6,4...1,1,1,1], middle rows starting with [1,1,1,4...] or [1,2,1,3...] and including trailing 1's, suggesting over-trimming of left/right protrusions, failure to apply special completion correctly, or incorrect concatenation order/positioning of multiple objects.
 * The trim_left_protrusions and trim_right_protrusions functions may be too aggressive or misapplied in sequence, removing parts that should be retained (e.g., single-1 or 4/5-inclusive columns that are structural).
 * apply_special_completion did not trigger or extend properly, as generated lacks the expected extended patterns with 1's in specific positions.
 * Sorting by reverse min_r placed objects in wrong horizontal order, leading to mismatched alignments (e.g., generated has repeated 4/6 blocks without the expected 1/2/3 prefixes).
 * pad_to_5_rows works but may interact poorly if subgrids are not pre-trimmed correctly, causing bg padding in wrong places.
 * Overall, component extraction via find_large_components is solid (as it passed train 1), but post-extraction processing (trimming and completion) fails on multi-object or asymmetric cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 5x23 grid with patterns like top row [6,1,3,3,3,1,7,1,7,8,6,6,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,6,6], showing clustered 3's, 6's, 8's, and scattered 1/7/9, suggesting multiple concatenated objects (e.g., left block with 6/1/3/7/8, middle with 1/3/8/9, right with 3/6).
 * It does not look fully correct: Patterns appear over-trimmed (e.g., bottom row has long 8's then 3/7/3 block then 1/3's, but lacks symmetry or completion extensions seen in train 2 expected); middle rows have isolated 1's and 7's that might be protrusions not trimmed properly, and the overall structure doesn't align into clean symbols (e.g., no clear 5-row uniform columns for special completion). Compared to train 2 errors, it likely suffers from similar issues: incorrect protrusion removal (retaining or removing 7/9 as non-simple) and no evident special completion (no appended 1's). Without expected test output, it's unclear if lengths match, but the asymmetry and scattered values suggest incomplete handling of object boundaries or ordering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of large connected non-background components (blobs or objects) from a 2D grid of integers, where the background value is the top-left cell. The goal is to isolate these components, trim extraneous parts (background borders and specific protrusions), pad them vertically to exactly 5 rows centered with background, and then concatenate them horizontally into a single 5-row output grid, ordered in a specific way (likely top-to-bottom based on the minimum row index of each component).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined as 4-way connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells, with a minimum size threshold of 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Background value (bg) is always g[0][0], and all processing preserves or uses bg for padding/trimming.
 * After finding components, extract a tight bounding subgrid for each, then trim full columns of bg from left and right edges.
 * Additional trimming for "protrusions": On the left, remove columns if they have <=3 unique non-bg values including 4, or exactly 1 unique value which is 8; on the right, remove if <=2 unique non-bg values including 5—these rules seem puzzle-specific to clean up irregular edges but may over-trim or misapply based on number patterns.
 * Vertical padding: Center the subgrid in 5 rows with bg; if taller than 5, crop from the center (but code takes from (h-5)//2, which is top-biased if uneven); if shorter, pad top and bottom evenly.
 * Ordering: Components are sorted by descending minimum row index (minr), placing lower-in-grid components to the left in the output; this may be incorrect, as expected outputs suggest top-to-bottom ordering (ascending minr, upper components left or first).
 * Horizontal concatenation: Append rows of each processed component side-by-side without separators, but expected outputs include patterns like vertical "1" bars that might be part of components or need special handling (e.g., as dividers).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no components returns 5 empty rows; subgrids with zero width after trimming are skipped.
 * Subtle elements: Number values (e.g., 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) likely represent colors, shapes, or pixel types in a visual puzzle (e.g., letters or icons); trimming rules are heuristic and tied to specific numbers, so they may not generalize—over-reliance on them causes mismatches. Outputs must be exactly 5 rows, with variable total width based on components. The puzzle may involve symmetry (e.g., top/bottom bars in train2), and generated outputs disrupt this by misordering or over-trimming.

 * Train2 incorrect: Generated output jumbles components—starts with a hybrid of the horizontal "4" bar and object top (e.g., row1: [4,6,6,6,4,...] instead of pure [4,4,4,...]), disrupts symmetry by placing object parts leftward, and misplaces "1" bars (e.g., row2 generated has early 1's vs. expected later); differences include shifted 6's/8's into bar areas, uneven widths, and wrong ordering (descending minr puts lower components left, but expected has top bar on top rows).
 * Ordering issue: Sorting by -minr (bottom-first) reverses expected top-to-bottom flow, causing concatenation to start with bottom bar/object mix.
 * Trimming protrusions over-applies or misapplies: Left trim removes too much from object (e.g., exposes inner 6's early), right trim cuts "1" separators or object edges incorrectly, leading to generated rows like [5,3,5,6,6,8,...] bleeding into bars.
 * Padding works but inherits upstream errors: 5-row output is correct height, but content is corrupted.
 * No handling for potential separators ("1" columns in expected): These may be separate small components (<10, ignored) or part of larger ones—generated ignores them, but expected includes them on right.
 * Overall: Core blob finding and padding are solid; fails on ordering, protrusion rules (too number-specific, easy to miss generalization need), and component fusion in concat.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (5x26 grid) does not look correct: It appears as a single jumbled concatenation without clear separation of objects, with irregular patterns (e.g., row1 starts [1,6,1,3,...] mixing small 1's with 3's/6's/7's/8's, row5 has long 8's then 3's/1's), lacking symmetry or distinct shapes seen in train2 expected (e.g., no clean horizontal bars or centered objects).
 * Differences from inferred correct: Based on puzzle rules, test input seems to have multiple vertical-ish objects (e.g., clusters of 3's,8's,6's,7's,9's) separated by 1's; correct output should extract 2-3 large components (>=10 cells), trim to clean shapes (e.g., letter-like: tall 8's as one, 3/9 cluster as another), pad to 5 rows, order top-to-bottom (ascending minr), and concat with possible "1" dividers if they qualify as components—generated instead mashes everything left-to-right without dividers, over-trims (e.g., protrusions remove 7/8 edges?), and orders wrong (possibly bottom-first, starting with lower 3/8/9's).
 * Why incorrect: No distinct objects emerge (e.g., row3/4 have scattered 3's/6's/8's vs. expected compact shapes); total width 26 suggests 2-4 components but fused messily; misses subtle rules like preserving "1" as separators (small components ignored, but expected train2 has them—perhaps threshold or inclusion wrong). Mentally simulating: Test grid has ~3 large blobs (left 3/8 tower, middle 7/8/6, right 3/9/6), should output as padded 5-row shapes side-by-side with 1's, but generated is one blob-like output.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Training example 1 result: ERROR - Execution error: cannot access local variable 'w' where it is not associated with a value

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Execution error: cannot access local variable 'w' where it is not associated with a value

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: cannot access local variable 'w' where it is not associated with a value
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:30:48] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify, extract, and refine large non-background connected components (blobs or objects) from an input grid, trim them according to specific rules (e.g., removing outer backgrounds and protrusions), apply conditional completions or modifications, pad or normalize to a 5-row format, and concatenate multiple processed objects horizontally into a single output grid of 5 rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is assumed to be the value at g[0][0]; all processing distinguishes non-bg cells (likely representing object pixels with values like 1,4,5) from bg.
 * Only consider "large" components: connected (4-directional adjacency) non-bg regions with at least 10 cells; smaller ones are ignored entirely.
 * Extraction uses bounding boxes for each component, creating minimal subgrids that tightly enclose the object.
 * Trimming outer bg rows/columns: Remove entirely bg rows from top/bottom and columns from left/right, but only if they are fully bg across the subgrid's width/height; if this empties the subgrid, return empty.
 * Trimming protrusions: For left/right edges, iteratively remove columns if they are fully bg or meet narrow conditions (e.g., <=3 unique non-bg values including 4 on left or 5 on right; full height of single value 1; or single non-bg cell of 1). This seems aimed at cleaning "antennae" or thin extensions but risks over-trimming if conditions are too broad.
 * Special completion: Only applies to 5-row subgrids with full-height uniform non-bg left column (value L), and right column with top/bottom matching (not bg or L), exactly one middle row (index 1-3) with 4. Then, it duplicates the penultimate column, adds two bg columns, and places 1's in the single-4 row at new positions—subtle pattern-filling, possibly for incomplete shapes like letters or symbols.
 * Padding/normalization: Always output exactly 5 rows; if subgrid >5 rows, crop center 5; if <5, pad top/bottom with bg rows centered; if empty or no components, return 5 empty rows. Multiple components are processed independently and concatenated horizontally (no vertical stacking or separation).
 * Sorting components: By top-left corner (min row, then min col) to ensure left-to-right order in output.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns 5 empty rows; no large components does the same; subgrids must be non-empty post-trimming to include in output.
 * Potential pitfalls: Over-trimming could destroy objects (e.g., if a valid thin column matches protrusion rules); special completion assumes exact 5 rows and specific patterns, missing which skips it; concatenation assumes all subs are padded to 5 rows but varying widths; no rotation, reflection, or color-based processing—purely structural.
 * Values like 1 (possibly foreground/object body), 4/5 (markers for protrusions or completion triggers) suggest a symbolic puzzle (e.g., extracting/cleaning icons from a noisy grid).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_large_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Uses DFS (stack-based) to find 4-connected non-bg components >=10 cells.
    # Returns list of cell lists (r,c tuples) for each large component.
    # Helpful for object detection; visited matrix prevents re-processing.
    # Directions: up, down, left, right (no diagonals).
    # Note: Assumes bg = g[0][0]; skips bg cells.
```

```python
def get_bounding_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Extracts minimal rectangular subgrid enclosing the component.
    # Computes min/max row/col from comp cells, slices g accordingly.
    # Helpful for isolating objects without excess bg.
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing fully bg rows from subgrid.
    # Slices sub[top:bottom]; returns empty if all rows bg.
    # Helpful for vertical normalization, but buggy in this version (uses undefined 'w').
```

```python
def trim_outer_bg_columns(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Removes leading/trailing fully bg columns from subgrid.
    # Slices each row[left:right]; returns h empty rows if all columns bg.
    # Helpful for horizontal normalization.
```

```python
def pad_to_5_rows(sub: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Normalizes to exactly 5 rows: crop center if >5, pad top/bottom with bg rows if <5.
    # Ensures consistent height for concatenation/output.
    # Helpful for final formatting; handles empty sub as 5 empty rows.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt implements a full pipeline for component detection, extraction, multi-step trimming, special pattern completion, and horizontal concatenation into 5-row output, showing understanding of object isolation and refinement rules.
 * What worked: find_large_components correctly identifies and sizes connected blobs (>=10 cells), sorting by position ensures order; get_bounding_subgrid pulls tight subgrids; trim_outer_bg_columns and pad_to_5_rows are logically sound for normalization; trim_left/right_protrusions captures subtle protrusion removal (e.g., thin 1's or sets with 4/5); apply_special_completion handles a specific "incomplete" pattern by extending and filling.
 * What didn't work: All runs (training 1, training 2, test) failed with execution error "cannot access local variable 'w' where it is not associated with a value" in trim_outer_bg_rows—'w' is referenced before assignment (line: "w = len(sub[0]) if w > 0 else 0" creates circular reference; should define w first as len(sub[0]) if sub else 0). This crashes before any output, so no generated grids to evaluate.
 * trim_outer_bg_rows is broken due to the 'w' bug and should be fixed (e.g., compute w = len(sub[0]) if sub and sub[0] else 0 before using).
 * trim_left/right_protrusions may be over-aggressive or miss cases (e.g., if protrusions have >3 unique values or don't include 4/5, they stay; unclear if this matches puzzle intent without successful runs).
 * apply_special_completion is narrow (requires exact conditions like full left uniform, single middle 4 on right) and skips otherwise—potentially misses variations.
 * No handling for vertical protrusions or more complex shapes; assumes all objects fit 5 rows post-trim, which may not hold.
 * Overall, structure is promising but untested due to bug; no successful outputs mean can't verify if trimming/completion produces expected clean objects (e.g., letter-like shapes?).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an ERROR (execution failure on undefined 'w' in trim_outer_bg_rows), so no grid is generated—does not make sense or look correct, as the puzzle requires a valid 5-row output grid (likely concatenated cleaned objects).
 * Without a generated grid, can't compare to expected (mentally: test input likely has large components needing trim/completion to form puzzle solution, e.g., symbols or paths; error prevents any processing beyond component finding).
 * This blocks evaluation; fix the bug to generate output, then check if it matches expected clean, concatenated forms (e.g., no protrusions, padded correctly, special fills applied where patterns match).
