=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 13:56:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 14:12:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to identify a background color, detect connected non-background components, select a "main" pattern from the most complex/large component, extract it as a tile, and then reconstruct or clean the entire grid by tiling this pattern across the full grid dimensions while handling or ignoring extraneous components (noise or duplicates) by effectively overwriting them with the tiled pattern or background as needed.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the flattened grid; non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency only—no diagonals).
 * Components are groups of non-background cells; each has positions and a set of distinct colors.
 * Main component selection prioritizes the one with the highest number of distinct colors, breaking ties by size (number of cells)—this captures the "pattern" over simple blobs or noise.
 * Extract the main component's bounding box to get the tile pattern, preserving relative colors and structure.
 * Other non-main components (ignored cells) represent noise or duplicate/partial patterns that should not disrupt the tiling; the goal is to tile the full input grid size with the pattern, overwriting everything (including ignored cells) with repeated instances of the tile, potentially filling gaps with background only if they align with tile edges or specific rules.
 * Subtlety: Tiling must cover the exact input dimensions (e.g., if input is HxW, output must be HxW); do not resize based on ignored components' bounding boxes, as this leads to mismatched or partial outputs.
 * Handle cases with no ignored cells by simply tiling the full grid (input H // tile_h rows of tiles, W // tile_w columns).
 * When ignored cells exist, do not build a mask sized to their bounding box—instead, project ignored positions onto a full-grid tile layout to decide per-tile whether to place the pattern or background, but ultimately aim for a clean, uniform tiling without large arbitrary background blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or all-background returns empty or background-filled; uneven division (H % tile_h != 0) may require partial tiles or background padding, but training suggests exact fits; multiple components with same distinct colors/size need consistent selection.
 * Colors like 3,4,6,8 suggest specific palettes (e.g., 8 as bg, 3 as fill, 4/6 as outlines); preserve exact values in output.
 * Avoid flooding entire grid with background or selecting wrong main (e.g., largest blob if it has fewer colors).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Identifies most common color as background—reliable for noisy grids.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], set]]:
    rows = len(g)
    cols = len(g[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                component_pos = []
                color_set = set()
                q = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    component_pos.append((x, y))
                    color_set.add(g[x][y])
                    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] != bg and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((component_pos, color_set))
    return components
```
(BFS for 4-connected components with positions and color sets—essential for separating pattern from noise.)

```python
def select_main_component(components: List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], set]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    max_distinct = -1
    max_size = -1
    main_pos = []
    for pos, colset in components:
        dist = len(colset)
        size = len(pos)
        if dist > max_distinct or (dist == max_distinct and size > max_size):
            max_distinct = dist
            max_size = size
            main_pos = pos
    return main_pos
```
(Selects main pattern by distinct colors then size—works well for identifying complex tiles over simple noise.)

```python
def get_bounding_box(pos_list: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not pos_list:
        return None, None, None, None
    min_r = min(p[0] for p in pos_list)
    max_r = max(p[0] for p in pos_list)
    min_c = min(p[1] for p in pos_list)
    max_c = max(p[1] for p in pos_list)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c

def extract_pattern(g: List[List[int]], bbox: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[List[List[int]], int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = bbox
    ph = max_r - min_r + 1
    pw = max_c - min_c + 1
    pattern = [[g[min_r + i][min_c + j] for j in range(pw)] for i in range(ph)]
    return pattern, ph, pw
```
(Bounding box and pattern extraction—critical for isolating the tile without extra background.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled training examples 1-3, likely because they had no ignored cells or simple layouts where full tiling (input dims // tile dims) sufficed without mask issues.
 * Failed to handle cases with ignored cells properly: when ignored exist, it incorrectly sizes the output to the ignored components' bounding box (mh, mw from ignored_bbox), leading to undersized or mismatched output grids; instead, always tile to full input size.
 * Mask logic is inverted or misplaced: setting mask[mr][mc] = True for ignored positions, then using if mask[mr][mc] to place pattern (should place pattern everywhere for clean tiling, or use mask to replace ignored with pattern/bg selectively, but not resize).
 * get_ignored_cells and build_mask are partially helpful for identifying noise but broken for tiling—do not use build_mask as-is in future, as it ties size to ignored bbox instead of full grid; repurpose to project ignored positions onto tile grid for per-tile decisions.
 * select_main_component worked well across all cases, correctly picking complex patterns.
 * In cases without ignored, the else branch correctly computes mh = rows // ph, mw = cols // pw and tiles fully—keep this logic, but apply it always, overlaying ignored handling without resizing.
 * No mention of handling partial tiles (if dims not divisible), but training passed, so likely inputs are exact multiples.
 * find_background and find_components are solid and essential—no issues observed.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 25x25 grid (matching likely input size), but it does not look correct: it shows inconsistent partial tiling of a 5x5 pattern (rows like [6,6,3,6,6], [6,4,3,4,6], [3,3,3,3,3] repeated), with large arbitrary blocks of background 8's (e.g., rows 6-10 and 16-20 have 15-col bg strips in the middle, flanked by single-tile patterns on left/right; top 5 rows have 5-col bg borders left/right with 3 tiles in middle).
 * Expected: A clean, uniform tiling of the 5x5 pattern across the full 25x25 (5 tiles high x 5 wide, no bg interruptions), overwriting all non-bg (including ignored components) with repeated pattern to "denoise" the grid into a perfect repeat.
 * Observed differences: Instead of full coverage, it produces "masked" regions with bg blocks sized to ignored components' positions (e.g., middle 15x5 bg strips suggest ignored bbox or mask projecting to skip tiles there), resulting in a patchy, non-uniform grid that retains noise-like gaps; this mismatches a clean solution and indicates the resize/mask bug—it's different because it doesn't fill everything with the pattern, leaving unexplained bg voids where tiling should continue.
 * The pattern itself (colors 3/4/6) is extracted correctly, but application fails; no large uniform bg or wrong main selected, but output isn't a sensible denoised tile repeat.
