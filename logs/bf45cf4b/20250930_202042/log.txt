=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 20:20:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

**High level:** This is a visual tiling puzzle where the input grid contains a background color, a single multi-color connected component (the "motif" pattern to be tiled), and multiple single-color connected components of one specific color (forming a "mask" that defines where to place tiles of the motif). The goal is to expand the motif by tiling it repeatedly into the positions indicated by the mask, filling the output grid with the tiled result while preserving the background elsewhere, resulting in a larger repeated pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is assumed to be at position [0][0] and used to identify non-background pixels; all connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and exclude background.
 * Exactly one multi-color component (len(colors) > 1) must exist, which defines the motif; its bounding box is extracted as a subgrid to tile.
 * Exactly one single-color group (multiple components of the same color) forms the mask; their positions are unioned into a binary grid (1 where mask color present, 0 elsewhere), using the mask's overall bounding box dimensions.
 * Tiling repeats the motif subgrid into every 1-position in the binary mask, scaling the output to mask_height * motif_height by mask_width * motif_width; background fills non-tiled areas.
 * Components must be non-background and connected; multi-color check is per-component (not global).
 * Bounding boxes are tight (min/max row/col per component), and tiling aligns to the mask grid without rotation, scaling, or overlap handling beyond the binary placement.
 * Subtle: Mask components may be disconnected but share the same color; motif may have internal background but is treated as solid for tiling. Output dimensions are derived dynamically from mask and motif sizes. Edge case: Empty mask or multiple multi-color components raise errors (as in code).
 * All training examples (1-3) passed, implying the rules hold for varied motif/mask sizes and positions, but test may involve larger/repeated structures or different color distributions.
 * Considerations across attempts: None prior, but code assumes rectangular tiling without gaps; potential misses include non-rectangular motifs (but code extracts rectangular bounding box, which may include internal bg—though tiling copies raw values, preserving any internal structure).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Set

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts background color simply from top-left; reliable if consistent.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Dict]:
    # (Full DFS-based connected components finder using stack for flood-fill)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'positions' (list of (r,c)), 'colors' (set of ints), and bounding box mins/maxes.
    # 4-directional connectivity; marks visited to avoid reprocessing.
    # Helpful for identifying motif (multi-color) and mask components (single-color).
```
(This is core and correct; handles arbitrary grid sizes and component shapes efficiently.)

(The `program` function itself is helpful as the main solver: identifies motif/mask, extracts binary and motif subgrids, computes output dimensions, and tiles by copying motif into mask=1 positions. Includes error checks for expected structure (one multi-comp, one single-color group).)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:** None in this attempt; all provided functions are relevant and working for training cases. Avoid ad-hoc modifications without testing connectivity or bounding box logic, as they could break on irregular shapes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt shown; it successfully solved all three training examples by correctly identifying the motif (multi-color component), mask (single-color components), extracting bounding boxes, and tiling the motif into the mask positions.
 * What worked: Connected components detection accurately separated motif from mask; binary mask creation and tiling logic scaled/repeated the motif correctly for training grids, preserving colors and background.
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the generated output appears to apply tiling but results in a grid that repeats small patterns (e.g., 6-4-3-4-6 rows interspersed with 3-rows and 8-background borders) in a way that may not fully match an expected larger seamless tiling—specifically, the output has vertical/horizontal repetitions that look like 5x5 motif tiled into a 5x5 mask, but the test input likely has a more complex mask with disconnected components or larger extent, leading to over-expansion or misalignment (e.g., the bottom sections repeat the pattern but with partial 8-background intrusions that don't align with a clean tile grid). It's unknown why the scaling seems off (possibly mask bounding box includes extra space or components are misgrouped), but the output grid (24 rows x 25 cols) differs from a expected tighter or differently proportioned result.
 * Error handling raised no exceptions, so structure assumptions held, but subtle connectivity (e.g., if test has diagonal connections not counted) or color grouping may be the issue.
 * find_components is essential for all object extraction and worked perfectly for training.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it applies the tiling logic (repeating a motif-like pattern of 6,4,3 into mask areas amid 8-background), the resulting 24x25 grid has repetitive blocks (e.g., 5-row motif cycles tiled 4-5 times vertically/horizontally) that create a striped, bordered pattern, but it seems mismatched—expected output should likely be a single large tiled expanse without the interspersed full-background rows/columns (e.g., rows 5-9 and 15-19 have solid 3's but are tiled oddly, and lower sections like rows 20-23 repeat without full integration). Differences include: extra background padding (e.g., 8's in positions where mask should overwrite), potential incorrect mask union (disconnected mask components may not form a uniform binary grid, leading to gaps), and output height/width (24x25) suggesting mask ~5x5 and motif ~5x5, but test input probably expects a 20x25 or similar without the vertical stacking artifacts. It partially makes sense as a tiled result but fails to produce a cohesive puzzle solution, likely due to how single_groups assumes all single-color comps form one mask without verifying spatial layout.
