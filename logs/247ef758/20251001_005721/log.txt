=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:57:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 01:15:54] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

[2025-10-01 01:15:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

[2025-10-01 01:28:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds column j in middle_rows with most uniform non-zero color (max_count of same color), or first uniform non-zero if none.
    # Helpful for identifying central propagation anchor, but may need refinement for ties or partial uniformity.

            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:

    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated colors in top row (differs from left/right neighbors) after row_color_col, up to m-2.
    # Useful for detecting seed points to fill middle rows, but limited to post-spine and may miss left or end cases.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

[2025-10-01 01:28:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 01:40:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by prioritizing maximum uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with a fallback for any uniform column; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 01:40:59] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components Across All Train Examples

After analyzing the three train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** puzzle. These are limited to properties (e.g., position via bbox, pixel count, color) and components (e.g., specific colored blobs) that show direct effects or changes in the same way across all examples. I focused only on elements with clear, repeatable interactions (e.g., one property affecting another's transformation). Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., most border 1-pixel dots that don't change) are excluded. Transformations that are not explainable or consistent (e.g., color changes to Dark Red, which occur in trains 1 and 2 but not 3; exact pixel adjustments like 5→5 vs. 4→4; right-side behaviors, which vary) are called out as unknown rather than forced. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted.

1. **Top-left outer position (bbox min_x=0-1, min_y=0-1, pixels total ≈4-5 across one or more adjacent same-color components) interacts with central position (bbox min_x≈5-8, min_y≈2-3)**:
   - Effect: The component(s) relocate to the central area, preserving color and total pixel count exactly or approximately (5→5 in trains 1 and 3; 4→4 in train 2 via separate 1-pixel moves).
   - Example components: Yellow (train 1, [0,0,2,2] p=5 → [8,3,10,5] p=5); Green (train 3, [0,0,2,2] p=5 → [6,2,8,4] p=5); Orange 1-pixel group (train 2, e.g., [1,0,1,0] p=1 + [0,1,0,1] p=1 + [2,1,2,1] p=1 + [1,2,1,2] p=1 total 4 → scattered central 1-pixel Oranges e.g., [9,4,9,4] p=1 + [8,5,8,5] p=1 + [10,5,10,5] p=1 + [9,6,9,6] p=1 total 4).
   - Unknown: Exact bbox transformation mechanism (e.g., shift amount varies: +8 x in train 1, +6 x in train 3, scattered in train 2); no holes involved (all holes=0).

2. **Left lower/mid position (bbox min_x=0-1, min_y≈4-8, pixels ≈4-9 across one or more same-color components) interacts with central lower position (bbox min_x≈5-9, min_y≈5-6)**:
   - Effect: The component(s) relocate to the central area, preserving color and pixel count approximately (9→8 in train 1; 5→7 in train 2 with minor addition unknown; 4→5 in train 3 via group).
   - Example components: Dark Red (train 1, [0,8,2,10] p=9 → [9,5,11,7] p=8); Dark Red group (train 2, [0,6,2,8] p=5 + [7,0,7,0] p=1 partial overlap in effect → [5,6,8,9] p=7); Pink 1-pixel group (train 3, e.g., [1,4,1,4] p=1 + [0,5,0,5] p=1 + [2,5,2,5] p=1 + [1,6,1,6] p=1 total 4 → central rightish Pinks e.g., [11,5,11,5] p=1 + [10,6,10,6] p=1 + [12,6,13,6] p=2 + [11,7,11,7] p=1 total 5).
   - Unknown: Why pixel count adjusts slightly (+/-1, possibly from unlisted interaction); exact role of color (Dark Red in 1/2, Pink in 3—consistent as "darker/special" color? Unclear); no consistent holes (all 0); in train 3, a similar Dark Red [0,8,2,8] p=3 stays unchanged instead of moving.

3. **Pixelated rendering (all components: sharp bbox boundaries, no gradients, holes=0) interacts with position changes**:
   - Effect: All relocations preserve the blocky, low-res style—no new holes created, no smoothing; bbox expands/contracts to fit new position but maintains integer coordinates and pixel density consistency.
   - Example: Applies to all moved components above (e.g., bbox width/height ≈2-3 before/after in trains 1/3; scattered 1x1 in train 2).
   - Unknown: How pixel count within bbox is recalculated post-move (e.g., [0,0,2,2] p=5 implies non-full fill, preserved but not explained).

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color changes like Green→Dark Red in train 1 only; vertical bar color affecting moves, which varies without clear effect; right-top bars, which move in 1/2 but stay in 3) are consistent across every example. Side border 1-pixel components (e.g., at x=4/17, various y) show no interactions—they remain identical and are excluded. Central black space is implied as the "target" for relocations but not explicitly listed in data, so its role is unknown beyond position effect.

[2025-10-01 01:43:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds column j in middle_rows with most uniform non-zero color (max_count of same color), or first uniform non-zero if none.
    # Helpful for identifying central propagation anchor, but may need refinement for ties or partial uniformity.
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated colors in top row (differs from left/right neighbors) after row_color_col, up to m-2.
    # Useful for detecting seed points to fill middle rows, but limited to post-spine and may miss left or end cases.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by prioritizing maximum uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with a fallback for any uniform column; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components Across All Train Examples

After analyzing the three train input-output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** puzzle. These are limited to properties (e.g., position via bbox, pixel count, color) and components (e.g., specific colored blobs) that show direct effects or changes in the same way across all examples. I focused only on elements with clear, repeatable interactions (e.g., one property affecting another's transformation). Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., most border 1-pixel dots that don't change) are excluded. Transformations that are not explainable or consistent (e.g., color changes to Dark Red, which occur in trains 1 and 2 but not 3; exact pixel adjustments like 5→5 vs. 4→4; right-side behaviors, which vary) are called out as unknown rather than forced. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted.

1. **Top-left outer position (bbox min_x=0-1, min_y=0-1, pixels total ≈4-5 across one or more adjacent same-color components) interacts with central position (bbox min_x≈5-8, min_y≈2-3)**:
   - Effect: The component(s) relocate to the central area, preserving color and total pixel count exactly or approximately (5→5 in trains 1 and 3; 4→4 in train 2 via separate 1-pixel moves).
   - Example components: Yellow (train 1, [0,0,2,2] p=5 → [8,3,10,5] p=5); Green (train 3, [0,0,2,2] p=5 → [6,2,8,4] p=5); Orange 1-pixel group (train 2, e.g., [1,0,1,0] p=1 + [0,1,0,1] p=1 + [2,1,2,1] p=1 + [1,2,1,2] p=1 total 4 → scattered central 1-pixel Oranges e.g., [9,4,9,4] p=1 + [8,5,8,5] p=1 + [10,5,10,5] p=1 + [9,6,9,6] p=1 total 4).
   - Unknown: Exact bbox transformation mechanism (e.g., shift amount varies: +8 x in train 1, +6 x in train 3, scattered in train 2); no holes involved (all holes=0).

2. **Left lower/mid position (bbox min_x=0-1, min_y≈4-8, pixels ≈4-9 across one or more same-color components) interacts with central lower position (bbox min_x≈5-9, min_y≈5-6)**:
   - Effect: The component(s) relocate to the central area, preserving color and pixel count approximately (9→8 in train 1; 5→7 in train 2 with minor addition unknown; 4→5 in train 3 via group).
   - Example components: Dark Red (train 1, [0,8,2,10] p=9 → [9,5,11,7] p=8); Dark Red group (train 2, [0,6,2,8] p=5 + [7,0,7,0] p=1 partial overlap in effect → [5,6,8,9] p=7); Pink 1-pixel group (train 3, e.g., [1,4,1,4] p=1 + [0,5,0,5] p=1 + [2,5,2,5] p=1 + [1,6,1,6] p=1 total 4 → central rightish Pinks e.g., [11,5,11,5] p=1 + [10,6,10,6] p=1 + [12,6,13,6] p=2 + [11,7,11,7] p=1 total 5).
   - Unknown: Why pixel count adjusts slightly (+/-1, possibly from unlisted interaction); exact role of color (Dark Red in 1/2, Pink in 3—consistent as "darker/special" color? Unclear); no consistent holes (all 0); in train 3, a similar Dark Red [0,8,2,8] p=3 stays unchanged instead of moving.

3. **Pixelated rendering (all components: sharp bbox boundaries, no gradients, holes=0) interacts with position changes**:
   - Effect: All relocations preserve the blocky, low-res style—no new holes created, no smoothing; bbox expands/contracts to fit new position but maintains integer coordinates and pixel density consistency.
   - Example: Applies to all moved components above (e.g., bbox width/height ≈2-3 before/after in trains 1/3; scattered 1x1 in train 2).
   - Unknown: How pixel count within bbox is recalculated post-move (e.g., [0,0,2,2] p=5 implies non-full fill, preserved but not explained).

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color changes like Green→Dark Red in train 1 only; vertical bar color affecting moves, which varies without clear effect; right-top bars, which move in 1/2 but stay in 3) are consistent across every example. Side border 1-pixel components (e.g., at x=4/17, various y) show no interactions—they remain identical and are excluded. Central black space is implied as the "target" for relocations but not explicitly listed in data, so its role is unknown beyond position effect.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 01:48:33] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-filling puzzle where colors from the top and bottom rows propagate into the middle rows based on patterns, likely forming "objects" or "blobs" guided by a central "spine" column of consistent color, with rules for filling adjacent cells, avoiding forbidden colors, and handling special transition points in the top row. The goal is to complete the grid by filling zeros with appropriate colors while preserving existing non-zero cells and ensuring symmetry or pattern matching across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) that has the most consistent non-zero color; if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column—subtlety: this spine guides propagation to the rightmost column but only if it's not at the edge.
 * Propagate the color from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) to the last column (m-1) in middle rows, but only for non-zero values.
 * Clear "forbidden" colors in left-side columns (0 to spine-1) of middle rows if those colors appear non-zero in the top or bottom rows from spine to end—this prevents overlap or invalid extensions, but it's easy to miss that forbidden is a set of colors from borders only in right half.
 * Group "specials": these are columns in the top row (from row_color_col+1 to m-2) where the color changes from neighbors (c != left and c != right), indicating starts/ends of patterns; subtlety: group consecutive specials into clusters, and handle singles vs. groups differently (e.g., singles may skip centers under conditions, groups of 2 get extra 3-wide fills in adjacent rows).
 * For filling: Use "homes" (middle rows with the special's color in row_color_col) to fill 3-wide horizontal strips (left=max(row_color_col, j-1) to right=min(m-2, j+1)) in those rows and vertically in adjacent rows (±1), but only zeros and avoiding skips for certain cases; for groups >1, treat as expanded fills without center skips, and for glen=2 add extra 3-wide in adj rows for the second.
 * Subtlety: Half-point (m//2) influences skipping centers for single specials if the color appears only once right of center; also, homes are filtered by row index <= special column j, suggesting left-to-right propagation bias.
 * Border rows (0 and n-1) should remain mostly unchanged except possibly clearing or matching, but code doesn't alter them much—easy to miss that top/bottom guide but aren't filled into.
 * Edge cases: Grids <3 rows return unchanged; no spine or invalid spine returns copy; non-consecutive specials form separate groups; all-zero columns in specials ignored.
 * General: Preserve all existing non-zeros; fills only to zeros; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; patterns seem to form vertical/horizontal extensions of top-row blobs into middle, like a "shadow" or "support" structure.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function is helpful for identifying the guiding spine column based on consistency in middle rows.)

```python
def find_specials(grid_out: List[List[int]], rcc: int, mm: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(rcc + 1, mm - 1):
        c = grid_out[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid_out[0][j - 1] and c != grid_out[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special

def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(These are useful for detecting and clustering transition points in the top row, essential for targeted filling.)

```python
r_cs = defaultdict(list)
for i in middle_rows:
    c = g_out[i][row_color_col]
    if c != 0:
        r_cs[c].append(i)
```
(This defaultdict collects "homes" per color from the row_color_col, key for selecting rows to fill.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the spine in all training examples (e.g., likely column 4 with color 3 in Train 1), propagates to the last column accurately (e.g., ends with 3/4/7/6 as expected), and clears some forbidden left-side cells (e.g., zeros out many left positions in middle rows).
 * What worked: Grouping specials correctly detects transitions (e.g., in Train 1, specials around columns for 6,4,7,6 changes); basic 3-wide fills for singles and groups partially match, like filling 4/7 blobs in rows 4-7 of Train 1; vertical propagation to adj rows works in places (e.g., row 6 in Train 1 gets 7s).
 * What didn't work: Over-fills or incorrect fills in unexpected places, e.g., in Train 1, top row (row 0) position 1 filled with 4 (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]), and row 11 position 1 also 4 vs 0—suggests unintended border modification or propagation leak; in row 4 of Train 1, position 8 has 4 but expected 0? Wait, actually rows 0-11 generated vs expected show minor diffs like row 4 pos 4:4 vs 4 (match), but overall mismatches in left fills.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 4s in top/bottom left (pos 1), and row 5 pos 17:3 vs expected 3 (match?), but row 9 pos 4:6 vs 6 (match)—diffs mainly in borders and some middle left (e.g., row 3 pos 9:4 vs 0? No, row 3: [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] vs expected same, wait—actually close but says INCORRECT, likely subtle like row 4 pos 8:4 vs 0? Upon close check, generated row 4 has pos 8:4 but expected pos 8:0 in some? No, expected row 4: [0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]—yes, pos 8:4 matches, but perhaps row 0/11 extras are the issue; unknown why borders got filled.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated fills too many 4s/7s in middle, e.g., row 1 pos 9-11:4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0; row 2 pos 10:4 vs 7; row 4 pos 7-12:0,4,4,4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0,5,0,0; row 5 pos 5:5 vs 5 (match), but row 6 pos 9:5 vs 5 (match)—over-filling groups without proper skipping or home filtering; also top row pos 1:5 vs 0.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated top row pos 1:3 vs 0; row 1 pos 7:0 vs 0 (match), but row 2 pos 7:3 vs 3 (match?); row 6 pos 13:6 vs 6 (match), but row 8 pos 0-2:7,7,7 vs 7,7,7 (match)—diffs in left fills like row 0 pos 1:3 vs 0, and some middle like row 3 pos 4:3 vs 3 (match), but row 6 pos 4:6 vs 6; seems extra border fills and incomplete clears (e.g., row 9 pos 1-3:0,0,0 vs 0,0,0).
 * Overall: The filling logic for groups (esp. glen=2 with extra adj fills) over-extends horizontally/vertically, ignoring some zero preservations; skip_center logic doesn't trigger properly (e.g., in Train 1 single 6 at pos 6?); home filtering (ii <= j) may be too restrictive or not applied consistently; no extraction of full "objects" or blobs, so misses holistic shape matching—consider adding a function to validate blob connectivity post-fill.
 * Function find_spine is helpful and seems accurate; find_specials and group_specials are useful but may mis-detect if top row has zeros or plateaus; r_cs is essential for per-color homes but could be enhanced to check vertical consistency; the glen>=3 handling as "non-skipping singles" works partially but leads to fragmented fills; no unhelpful functions, but the complex if-else for groups is brittle—easy to miss that for glen=2, first special gets standard fill but second gets extra adj 3-wide, which overfills in Train 2.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits issues from the training failures: e.g., top row (row 0) has pos 1:1 vs likely expected 0 (similar to Train 1/2/3 border overfills); row 12 pos 1:7 vs probably 0; row 14 has many 9s in right but left pos 6-19 overfilled with 9s where patterns like 1-blob or 3/4/6 should be sparser.
 * Middle rows show partial propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3s around pos 5-11, matching a potential 3-blob; row 7-9 have 4s in pos 13-16, good for a 4-group), but overfills like row 3 pos 6-9:1,1,1,1 vs likely narrower (expected might zero some based on top 1 at pos 7); row 10 pos 14-16:6,6,6 good, but row 5 pos 10:3 vs possibly 0 if not a home.
 * Right column (pos 19) consistently filled with 9/1/3/4/6/9 as per propagation, which makes sense if spine is col 4 (3s), but left clears are incomplete (e.g., row 2 pos 7:1 but if 1 forbidden from top, should be 0); vertical fills in adj rows seem spotty, e.g., row 7 pos 5:4 but row 6/8 pos 5:3/0 mismatch.
 * Overall, it partially forms blobs (e.g., 9s in rows 1-2,5,11-14 right-side), but extras like row 14 pos 6:8 (from top?) and missing sparsity in 1/3 areas suggest wrong special grouping or skip logic—does not match expected holistic patterns, likely needs better forbidden application and group handling to avoid dense overfills.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 01:48:44] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on a direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of only those properties, components, or interactions that are **consistent across EVERY train example** (i.e., present and behaving identically in all 3 pairs). I focused solely on obvious, direct connections or effects between elements (e.g., position influencing stability, components affecting each other's presence via fixed framing). No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone single-pixel blocks without positional ties to others) are excluded. Inconsistent changes (e.g., specific color movements or merges that do not occur in all pairs) are noted as unknown where applicable. All listed items involve no holes (consistent holes=0 everywhere, with no interaction via holes observed).

1. **Left vertical bar component interacts with surrounding grid borders via fixed positioning**:
   - Description: A tall, thin (single-column) colored bar on the left side (bbox approx. [3-4,0] to [3-4,9-11], pixels=10-12) remains completely unchanged in color, position, bbox, and pixel count from input to output.
   - Interaction/Effect: Its fixed position anchors the left edge of the overall grid-like border structure, preventing transformation or movement of adjacent border elements (e.g., top and bottom rows). This stability affects the containment of central area changes by maintaining asymmetric frame integrity across all examples.
   - Consistency: Identical in all 3 train pairs (colors vary by example—Red in 1, Green in 2, Blue in 3—but the positional fixity and bordering role are universal).
   - Unknowns: No effect on color changes; bar color does not influence other components.

2. **Top row single-pixel blocks interact with vertical bar via horizontal positional alignment**:
   - Description: Single-pixel (pixels=1) colored blocks at y=0 (various x positions, e.g., [6-11,0] or similar spans) remain unchanged in color, exact x-position, and pixel count.
   - Interaction/Effect: These blocks align horizontally with the top of the left vertical bar, stabilizing the upper border frame. Their fixed positions constrain vertical movement or transformation of any adjacent elements (e.g., no top-row pixels shift downward or change in any pair).
   - Consistency: Present and unchanged in all 3 train pairs (specific colors and x-positions vary, but the row-level stability and alignment with the vertical bar are universal).
   - Unknowns: No observed effect on central or bottom elements; no consistent color-to-position causation.

3. **Bottom row single-pixel blocks interact with vertical bar via horizontal positional alignment**:
   - Description: Single-pixel (pixels=1) colored blocks at bottom y (e.g., y=9 or 11, various x positions) remain unchanged in color, exact x-position, and pixel count.
   - Interaction/Effect: These blocks align horizontally with the bottom of the left vertical bar, stabilizing the lower border frame. Their fixed positions mirror the top row's role, containing any central area reorganizations without allowing bottom-row spillover.
   - Consistency: Present and unchanged in all 3 train pairs (specific colors and x-positions vary, but the row-level stability and alignment with the vertical bar are universal).
   - Unknowns: No observed upward movement or influence on upper elements; no consistent interaction with side protrusions.

4. **Side single-pixel protrusions (e.g., at mid-heights) interact with vertical bar via vertical positional tethering**:
   - Description: Isolated single-pixel (pixels=1) blocks at mid-y positions on left/right edges (e.g., [4 or 17,4-6] or similar) remain unchanged in color, position, and pixel count.
   - Interaction/Effect: These are tethered vertically to the fixed left vertical bar's extent, acting as static "anchors" that prevent horizontal expansion or shift of edge elements. Their presence ensures consistent asymmetry in border framing without affecting central dynamics.
   - Consistency: Small sets of these (2-4 per pair) appear and remain fixed in all 3 train pairs, always aligned with the bar's y-range.
   - Unknowns: No effect on color propagation or merging; exact count varies slightly but positional fixity does not.

5. **Central black square (empty canvas) interacts with all border components via containment**:
   - Description: The large empty rectangular central area (implied by surrounding colored blocks, approx. middle [~5-15, ~3-8]) remains empty and unchanged in bounds.
   - Interaction/Effect: It passively contains transformations in adjacent areas (e.g., new blobs appear within its bounds in outputs), while the fixed border components (vertical bar, top/bottom rows) effect its isolation by not encroaching on it. No pixels are added/removed from the central area itself, but borders enforce its boundaries consistently.
   - Consistency: Universal across all 3 pairs; central emptiness is preserved despite peripheral changes.
   - Unknowns: No active transformation within the central area is consistently explained (e.g., blob appearances vary by color/position); specific causes of central reorganizations are unknown.

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color effects, hole influences, or consistent multi-pixel blob movements/merges) are obvious and present in every train pair. Dynamic changes in central or peripheral multi-pixel blobs (e.g., position shifts or shape reforms) occur in all pairs but lack a uniform, explainable connection (e.g., pixel counts or colors do not consistently preserve across transformations). Elements like L-shaped protrusions or cross-like forms appear in some pairs but do not interact consistently (e.g., positions vary without fixed effects). Irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., maroon singles without ties) were excluded.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds column j in middle_rows with most uniform non-zero color (max_count of same color), or first uniform non-zero if none.
    # Helpful for identifying central propagation anchor, but may need refinement for ties or partial uniformity.
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated colors in top row (differs from left/right neighbors) after row_color_col, up to m-2.
    # Useful for detecting seed points to fill middle rows, but limited to post-spine and may miss left or end cases.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-filling puzzle where colors from the top and bottom rows propagate into the middle rows based on patterns, likely forming "objects" or "blobs" guided by a central "spine" column of consistent color, with rules for filling adjacent cells, avoiding forbidden colors, and handling special transition points in the top row. The goal is to complete the grid by filling zeros with appropriate colors while preserving existing non-zero cells and ensuring symmetry or pattern matching across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) that has the most consistent non-zero color; if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column—subtlety: this spine guides propagation to the rightmost column but only if it's not at the edge.
 * Propagate the color from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) to the last column (m-1) in middle rows, but only for non-zero values.
 * Clear "forbidden" colors in left-side columns (0 to spine-1) of middle rows if those colors appear non-zero in the top or bottom rows from spine to end—this prevents overlap or invalid extensions, but it's easy to miss that forbidden is a set of colors from borders only in right half.
 * Group "specials": these are columns in the top row (from row_color_col+1 to m-2) where the color changes from neighbors (c != left and c != right), indicating starts/ends of patterns; subtlety: group consecutive specials into clusters, and handle singles vs. groups differently (e.g., singles may skip centers under conditions, groups of 2 get extra 3-wide fills in adjacent rows).
 * For filling: Use "homes" (middle rows with the special's color in row_color_col) to fill 3-wide horizontal strips (left=max(row_color_col, j-1) to right=min(m-2, j+1)) in those rows and vertically in adjacent rows (±1), but only zeros and avoiding skips for certain cases; for groups >1, treat as expanded fills without center skips, and for glen=2 add extra 3-wide in adj rows for the second.
 * Subtlety: Half-point (m//2) influences skipping centers for single specials if the color appears only once right of center; also, homes are filtered by row index <= special column j, suggesting left-to-right propagation bias.
 * Border rows (0 and n-1) should remain mostly unchanged except possibly clearing or matching, but code doesn't alter them much—easy to miss that top/bottom guide but aren't filled into.
 * Edge cases: Grids <3 rows return unchanged; no spine or invalid spine returns copy; non-consecutive specials form separate groups; all-zero columns in specials ignored.
 * General: Preserve all existing non-zeros; fills only to zeros; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; patterns seem to form vertical/horizontal extensions of top-row blobs into middle, like a "shadow" or "support" structure.

    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):

        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:

                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function is helpful for identifying the guiding spine column based on consistency in middle rows.)

```python
def find_specials(grid_out: List[List[int]], rcc: int, mm: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(rcc + 1, mm - 1):
        c = grid_out[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid_out[0][j - 1] and c != grid_out[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special

def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(These are useful for detecting and clustering transition points in the top row, essential for targeted filling.)

```python
r_cs = defaultdict(list)
for i in middle_rows:
    c = g_out[i][row_color_col]
    if c != 0:
        r_cs[c].append(i)
```
(This defaultdict collects "homes" per color from the row_color_col, key for selecting rows to fill.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the spine in all training examples (e.g., likely column 4 with color 3 in Train 1), propagates to the last column accurately (e.g., ends with 3/4/7/6 as expected), and clears some forbidden left-side cells (e.g., zeros out many left positions in middle rows).
 * What worked: Grouping specials correctly detects transitions (e.g., in Train 1, specials around columns for 6,4,7,6 changes); basic 3-wide fills for singles and groups partially match, like filling 4/7 blobs in rows 4-7 of Train 1; vertical propagation to adj rows works in places (e.g., row 6 in Train 1 gets 7s).
 * What didn't work: Over-fills or incorrect fills in unexpected places, e.g., in Train 1, top row (row 0) position 1 filled with 4 (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]), and row 11 position 1 also 4 vs 0—suggests unintended border modification or propagation leak; in row 4 of Train 1, position 8 has 4 but expected 0? Wait, actually rows 0-11 generated vs expected show minor diffs like row 4 pos 4:4 vs 4 (match), but overall mismatches in left fills.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 4s in top/bottom left (pos 1), and row 5 pos 17:3 vs expected 3 (match?), but row 9 pos 4:6 vs 6 (match)—diffs mainly in borders and some middle left (e.g., row 3 pos 9:4 vs 0? No, row 3: [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] vs expected same, wait—actually close but says INCORRECT, likely subtle like row 4 pos 8:4 vs 0? Upon close check, generated row 4 has pos 8:4 but expected pos 8:0 in some? No, expected row 4: [0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]—yes, pos 8:4 matches, but perhaps row 0/11 extras are the issue; unknown why borders got filled.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated fills too many 4s/7s in middle, e.g., row 1 pos 9-11:4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0; row 2 pos 10:4 vs 7; row 4 pos 7-12:0,4,4,4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0,5,0,0; row 5 pos 5:5 vs 5 (match), but row 6 pos 9:5 vs 5 (match)—over-filling groups without proper skipping or home filtering; also top row pos 1:5 vs 0.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated top row pos 1:3 vs 0; row 1 pos 7:0 vs 0 (match), but row 2 pos 7:3 vs 3 (match?); row 6 pos 13:6 vs 6 (match), but row 8 pos 0-2:7,7,7 vs 7,7,7 (match)—diffs in left fills like row 0 pos 1:3 vs 0, and some middle like row 3 pos 4:3 vs 3 (match), but row 6 pos 4:6 vs 6; seems extra border fills and incomplete clears (e.g., row 9 pos 1-3:0,0,0 vs 0,0,0).
 * Overall: The filling logic for groups (esp. glen=2 with extra adj fills) over-extends horizontally/vertically, ignoring some zero preservations; skip_center logic doesn't trigger properly (e.g., in Train 1 single 6 at pos 6?); home filtering (ii <= j) may be too restrictive or not applied consistently; no extraction of full "objects" or blobs, so misses holistic shape matching—consider adding a function to validate blob connectivity post-fill.
 * Function find_spine is helpful and seems accurate; find_specials and group_specials are useful but may mis-detect if top row has zeros or plateaus; r_cs is essential for per-color homes but could be enhanced to check vertical consistency; the glen>=3 handling as "non-skipping singles" works partially but leads to fragmented fills; no unhelpful functions, but the complex if-else for groups is brittle—easy to miss that for glen=2, first special gets standard fill but second gets extra adj 3-wide, which overfills in Train 2.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits issues from the training failures: e.g., top row (row 0) has pos 1:1 vs likely expected 0 (similar to Train 1/2/3 border overfills); row 12 pos 1:7 vs probably 0; row 14 has many 9s in right but left pos 6-19 overfilled with 9s where patterns like 1-blob or 3/4/6 should be sparser.
 * Middle rows show partial propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3s around pos 5-11, matching a potential 3-blob; row 7-9 have 4s in pos 13-16, good for a 4-group), but overfills like row 3 pos 6-9:1,1,1,1 vs likely narrower (expected might zero some based on top 1 at pos 7); row 10 pos 14-16:6,6,6 good, but row 5 pos 10:3 vs possibly 0 if not a home.
 * Right column (pos 19) consistently filled with 9/1/3/4/6/9 as per propagation, which makes sense if spine is col 4 (3s), but left clears are incomplete (e.g., row 2 pos 7:1 but if 1 forbidden from top, should be 0); vertical fills in adj rows seem spotty, e.g., row 7 pos 5:4 but row 6/8 pos 5:3/0 mismatch.
 * Overall, it partially forms blobs (e.g., 9s in rows 1-2,5,11-14 right-side), but extras like row 14 pos 6:8 (from top?) and missing sparsity in 1/3 areas suggest wrong special grouping or skip logic—does not match expected holistic patterns, likely needs better forbidden application and group handling to avoid dense overfills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by prioritizing maximum uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with a fallback for any uniform column; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on a direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of only those properties, components, or interactions that are **consistent across EVERY train example** (i.e., present and behaving identically in all 3 pairs). I focused solely on obvious, direct connections or effects between elements (e.g., position influencing stability, components affecting each other's presence via fixed framing). No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone single-pixel blocks without positional ties to others) are excluded. Inconsistent changes (e.g., specific color movements or merges that do not occur in all pairs) are noted as unknown where applicable. All listed items involve no holes (consistent holes=0 everywhere, with no interaction via holes observed).

1. **Left vertical bar component interacts with surrounding grid borders via fixed positioning**:
   - Description: A tall, thin (single-column) colored bar on the left side (bbox approx. [3-4,0] to [3-4,9-11], pixels=10-12) remains completely unchanged in color, position, bbox, and pixel count from input to output.
   - Interaction/Effect: Its fixed position anchors the left edge of the overall grid-like border structure, preventing transformation or movement of adjacent border elements (e.g., top and bottom rows). This stability affects the containment of central area changes by maintaining asymmetric frame integrity across all examples.
   - Consistency: Identical in all 3 train pairs (colors vary by example—Red in 1, Green in 2, Blue in 3—but the positional fixity and bordering role are universal).
   - Unknowns: No effect on color changes; bar color does not influence other components.

2. **Top row single-pixel blocks interact with vertical bar via horizontal positional alignment**:
   - Description: Single-pixel (pixels=1) colored blocks at y=0 (various x positions, e.g., [6-11,0] or similar spans) remain unchanged in color, exact x-position, and pixel count.
   - Interaction/Effect: These blocks align horizontally with the top of the left vertical bar, stabilizing the upper border frame. Their fixed positions constrain vertical movement or transformation of any adjacent elements (e.g., no top-row pixels shift downward or change in any pair).
   - Consistency: Present and unchanged in all 3 train pairs (specific colors and x-positions vary, but the row-level stability and alignment with the vertical bar are universal).
   - Unknowns: No observed effect on central or bottom elements; no consistent color-to-position causation.

3. **Bottom row single-pixel blocks interact with vertical bar via horizontal positional alignment**:
   - Description: Single-pixel (pixels=1) colored blocks at bottom y (e.g., y=9 or 11, various x positions) remain unchanged in color, exact x-position, and pixel count.
   - Interaction/Effect: These blocks align horizontally with the bottom of the left vertical bar, stabilizing the lower border frame. Their fixed positions mirror the top row's role, containing any central area reorganizations without allowing bottom-row spillover.
   - Consistency: Present and unchanged in all 3 train pairs (specific colors and x-positions vary, but the row-level stability and alignment with the vertical bar are universal).
   - Unknowns: No observed upward movement or influence on upper elements; no consistent interaction with side protrusions.

4. **Side single-pixel protrusions (e.g., at mid-heights) interact with vertical bar via vertical positional tethering**:
   - Description: Isolated single-pixel (pixels=1) blocks at mid-y positions on left/right edges (e.g., [4 or 17,4-6] or similar) remain unchanged in color, position, and pixel count.
   - Interaction/Effect: These are tethered vertically to the fixed left vertical bar's extent, acting as static "anchors" that prevent horizontal expansion or shift of edge elements. Their presence ensures consistent asymmetry in border framing without affecting central dynamics.
   - Consistency: Small sets of these (2-4 per pair) appear and remain fixed in all 3 train pairs, always aligned with the bar's y-range.
   - Unknowns: No effect on color propagation or merging; exact count varies slightly but positional fixity does not.

5. **Central black square (empty canvas) interacts with all border components via containment**:
   - Description: The large empty rectangular central area (implied by surrounding colored blocks, approx. middle [~5-15, ~3-8]) remains empty and unchanged in bounds.
   - Interaction/Effect: It passively contains transformations in adjacent areas (e.g., new blobs appear within its bounds in outputs), while the fixed border components (vertical bar, top/bottom rows) effect its isolation by not encroaching on it. No pixels are added/removed from the central area itself, but borders enforce its boundaries consistently.
   - Consistency: Universal across all 3 pairs; central emptiness is preserved despite peripheral changes.
   - Unknowns: No active transformation within the central area is consistently explained (e.g., blob appearances vary by color/position); specific causes of central reorganizations are unknown.

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color effects, hole influences, or consistent multi-pixel blob movements/merges) are obvious and present in every train pair. Dynamic changes in central or peripheral multi-pixel blobs (e.g., position shifts or shape reforms) occur in all pairs but lack a uniform, explainable connection (e.g., pixel counts or colors do not consistently preserve across transformations). Elements like L-shaped protrusions or cross-like forms appear in some pairs but do not interact consistently (e.g., positions vary without fixed effects). Irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., maroon singles without ties) were excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y

[2025-10-01 01:56:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero cells (empty spaces) with appropriate color numbers based on patterns, symmetries, and propagation rules across rows and columns, likely simulating object placement or contour filling in a 2D scene with top/bottom borders and middle "body" rows that extend or match colors from a central "spine" structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that act as fixed borders or outlines, while middle rows (1 to n-2) are where most filling/propagation occurs, often mirroring or extending patterns from these borders without overwriting non-zero cells.
 * Identify a "spine" column (or near it) in middle rows where a single consistent non-zero color dominates vertically; this serves as an anchor for horizontal propagation to the right (e.g., filling the last column with the spine's color) and vertical influences.
 * "Forbidden" colors are collected from top/bottom rows to the right of the spine and used to clear conflicting colors to the left of the spine in middle rows, ensuring no bleed-over from border patterns.
 * "Special" columns are isolated non-zero cells in the top row that differ from immediate neighbors (e.g., peaks or isolated features); these trigger targeted filling in middle rows for matching colors, often limited to homes (rows) associated with that color and propagating horizontally within bounds (e.g., j-1 to j+1, but adjusted near edges) and vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Color "homes" are middle rows grouped by their color in a key column (spine+1), and filling for specials is restricted to homes "below" or at the special's position (e.g., ii <= j), suggesting a downward or positional hierarchy.
 * Propagation is conservative: only fill zeros, avoid overwriting existing non-zeros, and respect grid edges (e.g., no filling beyond m-2 or before spine+1 in some cases); vertical propagation is limited to immediate adjacent rows (dr = -1,1) and only if target is zero.
 * Subtleties: Spine detection prioritizes columns with the most consistent non-zero color in middle rows, falling back to any uniform non-zero; specials skip edge cases (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2). Filling for specials may need to extend further right/left in some cases (e.g., for wider objects like the 7s in train1 row5/6/7). Edge handling is critical near m-3 or later, where left bounds shift rightward. No filling if n<3. Patterns suggest symmetry or object completion (e.g., filling blobs like 7s horizontally across multiple columns if aligned).
 * Across attempts, over-filling or under-filling occurs: e.g., missing horizontal extensions for colors like 7 in train1 (row5 col11=7 expected but 0 generated), incorrect vertical fills (train3 row6 col12=0 expected but 6 generated), or misplaced propagations (train2 row4 col7=0 expected but 4 generated). Test grid shows complex interactions with multiple colors (3,9,1,4,6,7,8) and potential multi-spine or irregular objects.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds column with most consistent non-zero color in middle rows; fallback to first uniform non-zero.
    # Helpful for anchoring propagation, but may need refinement for ties or multiple spines.
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated non-zero cells in top row differing from neighbors, starting after row_color_col.
    # Useful for detecting key features to propagate, but skips m-1 and assumes top row as reference.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies spines in simple cases (e.g., col4 with color 3 in train1/2/3 middles) and propagates last-column fills accurately (e.g., all 3s in train1 middles col17).
 * What worked: Clearing forbidden colors left of spine (e.g., train1 row1-11 col0-3 cleared to 0 where conflicting); basic home grouping by color in row_color_col (spine+1); vertical propagation for specials in adjacent rows if zero (e.g., train3 row7 col11=6 from row6).
 * What didn't work: Under-fills horizontal extensions for specials (train1 row5 col12=0 generated but 7 expected; train1 row7 col9-11=7,7,7 expected but partial/missing); over-fills or misplaces in specials (train2 row4 col7=4 generated but 0 expected; train2 row2 col10=4 generated but 7 expected); incorrect spine fallback or special bounds (train3 row6 col12=6 generated but 0 expected, possibly from over-propagation of 6 homes).
 * Train1: Generated misses 7s in row5 col12, row7 col9-10 (under-fill blob); row3 col17=3 correct but row4 col17=4 expected (wrong last-col prop for color4 row); row8 col9=0 generated but 7 expected (missed vertical from row7).
 * Train2: Generated over-fills row1 col9-10=4,4 but expected 0,0; row2 col10=4 but 7 expected (wrong color prop); row4 col7=4 but 0 expected; row5 col9=4 but 5 expected (misplaced 5); row6 col13-14=0,0 but expected 0,0 correct, but overall pattern mismatches border extensions.
 * Train3: Generated row6 col12=6 but 0 expected (over-fill right of 6); row6 col10=0 but 6 expected (under-fill 6 blob); row7 col12=6 but 0 expected (vertical over-prop).
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; current program lacks blob detection (e.g., connected components for colors like 7s or 4s) which could help complete shapes.
 * Function `program` overall is a good skeleton (copies grid, handles n<3) but broken in special filling bounds/logic (e.g., l/r ranges too narrow, ignores wider objects); find_spine helpful but may pick wrong col if ties; find_specials useful but misses if specials in bottom row or non-top.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., consistent 3s in col4 middles as potential spine, last-col fills like 9s/3s/4s/6s match row colors in col5; some clearings left of col4 to 0s; vertical fills like row7 col19=3 from row6) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Issues: Under-fills apparent blobs, e.g., row6 col5=3, col9=3, col10=3, col11=3 but col12=0 (likely needs horizontal extension to match expected 3 blob from border); row7 col14-16=4,4,4 correct but row8 col14-16=4,4,4 overwrites? Wait, generated has them as 4s but if forbidden, should clear—unclear without rules, but pattern suggests row8 col10=0 should fill to 3? from row7 col10=3.
 * Over-fills or misses: row3 col5-9=1,1,1,1,0 but top has 1 at col7, suggests special at col7=1, but generated row3 col9=0 (under-fill right); row12 col1=7 but top/middle suggest 7s in left cols, possibly forbidden clear missed; row13 col19=9 correct but row11 col19=9 from prop, yet row10 col17=0 but expected 6 extension from row9 col15-17=4,6,6? (wait, color mismatch).
 * Test has irregular features (e.g., 8s in row13-14 col2-3, 7s in row12 col1/3, multiple 9 blobs in top/bottom), so output misses completing 9s in middles (e.g., row1-2 col5=9 but col6=0 generated, likely needs fill); 1 in row3 col7 propagates poorly (only row3 col5-8=1s, but row12 col5=1 suggests vertical but not filled). Does not account for potential multi-specials or color-specific widths (e.g., 6 in row9 col15-17 needs wider prop than 1-col).

[2025-10-01 01:56:38] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle (i.e., present in train input/output 1, 2, and 3). I focused only on elements with clear, repeatable effects or dependencies (e.g., position relative to other elements triggers a transformation). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., staying components with no change or connection, like most right-side blocks or bottom Dark Red blobs in examples 1 and 3) are excluded. Non-consistent elements (e.g., the disappearing low Dark Red blob in example 2 with no analog in 1 or 3; new Dark Red growth in examples 1 and 2 without a match in 3) are not included. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted—only direct, observable links are listed. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained (e.g., exact position shift), it is noted as unknown.

- **Vertical strip (tall, one-column component, e.g., Red at x=3 in example 1, Red at x=5 in example 2, Blue at x=3 in example 3) interacts with left-side components (x < vertical strip's x) via transport to right side (x > vertical strip's x)**: 
  - Affects: Connected components (blobs or singles) positioned entirely to the left of the vertical strip.
  - Effect: The left-side component(s) disappear from the left and reappear on the right, preserving color and exact pixel count (size). This happens to at least one such component in every example (Yellow 5-pixel blob in 1; multiple 1-pixel Orange components totaling 4 pixels in 2; Green 5-pixel blob in 3; plus 4 1-pixel Pink components in 3).
  - Consistent properties: Position (left of vertical) → transformation (removal + right-side addition); color preserved; pixels preserved per component (no size change or splitting).
  - Unknown: Exact new position on right (always mid-height y≈3-7, x shifted rightward, but shift distance varies: +8 in x and +3 in y for example 1; variable for singles in 2 and 3); no consistent shape rotation or mirroring observed.
  - No effect on right-side components unless merged (see below).

- **Transported components (from left-to-right via vertical strip) interact with same-color components on the right via potential merging**:
  - Affects: Only if the transported component lands adjacent to an existing same-color component on the right.
  - Effect: Merging into a single larger component if adjacent and same color (pixels add up). Observed in example 3 (transported 1-pixel Pinks merge with existing right-side Pink at [13,6] to form [12,13,6] with 2 pixels); no merge in examples 1 or 2 (transported components land isolated). Non-adjacent components remain separate.
  - Consistent properties: Same color + adjacent position (post-transport) → combined bbox and added pixels into one component.
  - Unknown: Exact conditions for adjacency (depends on unknown position mapping); merging not forced if not adjacent.

No other interactions (e.g., color changes, vertical strip modification, downward movement without transport, or hole/edge effects) are consistent across all three examples. Elements like central void areas or far-right clusters show no observable interactions in the data. If more examples were provided, additional connections might emerge, but based on this, the vertical strip's role as a "divider/portal" for left-right transport is the primary consistent mechanism.

[2025-10-01 01:59:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-filling puzzle where colors from the top and bottom rows propagate into the middle rows based on patterns, likely forming "objects" or "blobs" guided by a central "spine" column of consistent color, with rules for filling adjacent cells, avoiding forbidden colors, and handling special transition points in the top row. The goal is to complete the grid by filling zeros with appropriate colors while preserving existing non-zero cells and ensuring symmetry or pattern matching across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) that has the most consistent non-zero color; if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column—subtlety: this spine guides propagation to the rightmost column but only if it's not at the edge.
 * Propagate the color from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) to the last column (m-1) in middle rows, but only for non-zero values.
 * Clear "forbidden" colors in left-side columns (0 to spine-1) of middle rows if those colors appear non-zero in the top or bottom rows from spine to end—this prevents overlap or invalid extensions, but it's easy to miss that forbidden is a set of colors from borders only in right half.
 * Group "specials": these are columns in the top row (from row_color_col+1 to m-2) where the color changes from neighbors (c != left and c != right), indicating starts/ends of patterns; subtlety: group consecutive specials into clusters, and handle singles vs. groups differently (e.g., singles may skip centers under conditions, groups of 2 get extra 3-wide fills in adjacent rows).
 * For filling: Use "homes" (middle rows with the special's color in row_color_col) to fill 3-wide horizontal strips (left=max(row_color_col, j-1) to right=min(m-2, j+1)) in those rows and vertically in adjacent rows (±1), but only zeros and avoiding skips for certain cases; for groups >1, treat as expanded fills without center skips, and for glen=2 add extra 3-wide in adj rows for the second.
 * Subtlety: Half-point (m//2) influences skipping centers for single specials if the color appears only once right of center; also, homes are filtered by row index <= special column j, suggesting left-to-right propagation bias.
 * Border rows (0 and n-1) should remain mostly unchanged except possibly clearing or matching, but code doesn't alter them much—easy to miss that top/bottom guide but aren't filled into.
 * Edge cases: Grids <3 rows return unchanged; no spine or invalid spine returns copy; non-consecutive specials form separate groups; all-zero columns in specials ignored.
 * General: Preserve all existing non-zeros; fills only to zeros; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; patterns seem to form vertical/horizontal extensions of top-row blobs into middle, like a "shadow" or "support" structure.

```
(This function is helpful for identifying the guiding spine column based on consistency in middle rows.)

def find_specials(grid_out: List[List[int]], rcc: int, mm: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []

        c = grid_out[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid_out[0][j - 1] and c != grid_out[0][j + 1]:

                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(These are useful for detecting and clustering transition points in the top row, essential for targeted filling.)

```python
r_cs = defaultdict(list)
for i in middle_rows:
    c = g_out[i][row_color_col]
    if c != 0:
        r_cs[c].append(i)
```
(This defaultdict collects "homes" per color from the row_color_col, key for selecting rows to fill.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the spine in all training examples (e.g., likely column 4 with color 3 in Train 1), propagates to the last column accurately (e.g., ends with 3/4/7/6 as expected), and clears some forbidden left-side cells (e.g., zeros out many left positions in middle rows).
 * What worked: Grouping specials correctly detects transitions (e.g., in Train 1, specials around columns for 6,4,7,6 changes); basic 3-wide fills for singles and groups partially match, like filling 4/7 blobs in rows 4-7 of Train 1; vertical propagation to adj rows works in places (e.g., row 6 in Train 1 gets 7s).
 * What didn't work: Over-fills or incorrect fills in unexpected places, e.g., in Train 1, top row (row 0) position 1 filled with 4 (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]), and row 11 position 1 also 4 vs 0—suggests unintended border modification or propagation leak; in row 4 of Train 1, position 8 has 4 but expected 0? Wait, actually rows 0-11 generated vs expected show minor diffs like row 4 pos 4:4 vs 4 (match), but overall mismatches in left fills.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 4s in top/bottom left (pos 1), and row 5 pos 17:3 vs expected 3 (match?), but row 9 pos 4:6 vs 6 (match)—diffs mainly in borders and some middle left (e.g., row 3 pos 9:4 vs 0? No, row 3: [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] vs expected same, wait—actually close but says INCORRECT, likely subtle like row 4 pos 8:4 vs 0? Upon close check, generated row 4 has pos 8:4 but expected pos 8:0 in some? No, expected row 4: [0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]—yes, pos 8:4 matches, but perhaps row 0/11 extras are the issue; unknown why borders got filled.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated fills too many 4s/7s in middle, e.g., row 1 pos 9-11:4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0; row 2 pos 10:4 vs 7; row 4 pos 7-12:0,4,4,4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0,5,0,0; row 5 pos 5:5 vs 5 (match), but row 6 pos 9:5 vs 5 (match)—over-filling groups without proper skipping or home filtering; also top row pos 1:5 vs 0.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated top row pos 1:3 vs 0; row 1 pos 7:0 vs 0 (match), but row 2 pos 7:3 vs 3 (match?); row 6 pos 13:6 vs 6 (match), but row 8 pos 0-2:7,7,7 vs 7,7,7 (match)—diffs in left fills like row 0 pos 1:3 vs 0, and some middle like row 3 pos 4:3 vs 3 (match), but row 6 pos 4:6 vs 6; seems extra border fills and incomplete clears (e.g., row 9 pos 1-3:0,0,0 vs 0,0,0).
 * Overall: The filling logic for groups (esp. glen=2 with extra adj fills) over-extends horizontally/vertically, ignoring some zero preservations; skip_center logic doesn't trigger properly (e.g., in Train 1 single 6 at pos 6?); home filtering (ii <= j) may be too restrictive or not applied consistently; no extraction of full "objects" or blobs, so misses holistic shape matching—consider adding a function to validate blob connectivity post-fill.
 * Function find_spine is helpful and seems accurate; find_specials and group_specials are useful but may mis-detect if top row has zeros or plateaus; r_cs is essential for per-color homes but could be enhanced to check vertical consistency; the glen>=3 handling as "non-skipping singles" works partially but leads to fragmented fills; no unhelpful functions, but the complex if-else for groups is brittle—easy to miss that for glen=2, first special gets standard fill but second gets extra adj 3-wide, which overfills in Train 2.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits issues from the training failures: e.g., top row (row 0) has pos 1:1 vs likely expected 0 (similar to Train 1/2/3 border overfills); row 12 pos 1:7 vs probably 0; row 14 has many 9s in right but left pos 6-19 overfilled with 9s where patterns like 1-blob or 3/4/6 should be sparser.
 * Middle rows show partial propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3s around pos 5-11, matching a potential 3-blob; row 7-9 have 4s in pos 13-16, good for a 4-group), but overfills like row 3 pos 6-9:1,1,1,1 vs likely narrower (expected might zero some based on top 1 at pos 7); row 10 pos 14-16:6,6,6 good, but row 5 pos 10:3 vs possibly 0 if not a home.
 * Right column (pos 19) consistently filled with 9/1/3/4/6/9 as per propagation, which makes sense if spine is col 4 (3s), but left clears are incomplete (e.g., row 2 pos 7:1 but if 1 forbidden from top, should be 0); vertical fills in adj rows seem spotty, e.g., row 7 pos 5:4 but row 6/8 pos 5:3/0 mismatch.
 * Overall, it partially forms blobs (e.g., 9s in rows 1-2,5,11-14 right-side), but extras like row 14 pos 6:8 (from top?) and missing sparsity in 1/3 areas suggest wrong special grouping or skip logic—does not match expected holistic patterns, likely needs better forbidden application and group handling to avoid dense overfills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero cells (empty spaces) with appropriate color numbers based on patterns, symmetries, and propagation rules across rows and columns, likely simulating object placement or contour filling in a 2D scene with top/bottom borders and middle "body" rows that extend or match colors from a central "spine" structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that act as fixed borders or outlines, while middle rows (1 to n-2) are where most filling/propagation occurs, often mirroring or extending patterns from these borders without overwriting non-zero cells.
 * Identify a "spine" column (or near it) in middle rows where a single consistent non-zero color dominates vertically; this serves as an anchor for horizontal propagation to the right (e.g., filling the last column with the spine's color) and vertical influences.
 * "Forbidden" colors are collected from top/bottom rows to the right of the spine and used to clear conflicting colors to the left of the spine in middle rows, ensuring no bleed-over from border patterns.
 * "Special" columns are isolated non-zero cells in the top row that differ from immediate neighbors (e.g., peaks or isolated features); these trigger targeted filling in middle rows for matching colors, often limited to homes (rows) associated with that color and propagating horizontally within bounds (e.g., j-1 to j+1, but adjusted near edges) and vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Color "homes" are middle rows grouped by their color in a key column (spine+1), and filling for specials is restricted to homes "below" or at the special's position (e.g., ii <= j), suggesting a downward or positional hierarchy.
 * Propagation is conservative: only fill zeros, avoid overwriting existing non-zeros, and respect grid edges (e.g., no filling beyond m-2 or before spine+1 in some cases); vertical propagation is limited to immediate adjacent rows (dr = -1,1) and only if target is zero.
 * Subtleties: Spine detection prioritizes columns with the most consistent non-zero color in middle rows, falling back to any uniform non-zero; specials skip edge cases (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2). Filling for specials may need to extend further right/left in some cases (e.g., for wider objects like the 7s in train1 row5/6/7). Edge handling is critical near m-3 or later, where left bounds shift rightward. No filling if n<3. Patterns suggest symmetry or object completion (e.g., filling blobs like 7s horizontally across multiple columns if aligned).
 * Across attempts, over-filling or under-filling occurs: e.g., missing horizontal extensions for colors like 7 in train1 (row5 col11=7 expected but 0 generated), incorrect vertical fills (train3 row6 col12=0 expected but 6 generated), or misplaced propagations (train2 row4 col7=0 expected but 4 generated). Test grid shows complex interactions with multiple colors (3,9,1,4,6,7,8) and potential multi-spine or irregular objects.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies spines in simple cases (e.g., col4 with color 3 in train1/2/3 middles) and propagates last-column fills accurately (e.g., all 3s in train1 middles col17).
 * What worked: Clearing forbidden colors left of spine (e.g., train1 row1-11 col0-3 cleared to 0 where conflicting); basic home grouping by color in row_color_col (spine+1); vertical propagation for specials in adjacent rows if zero (e.g., train3 row7 col11=6 from row6).
 * What didn't work: Under-fills horizontal extensions for specials (train1 row5 col12=0 generated but 7 expected; train1 row7 col9-11=7,7,7 expected but partial/missing); over-fills or misplaces in specials (train2 row4 col7=4 generated but 0 expected; train2 row2 col10=4 generated but 7 expected); incorrect spine fallback or special bounds (train3 row6 col12=6 generated but 0 expected, possibly from over-propagation of 6 homes).
 * Train1: Generated misses 7s in row5 col12, row7 col9-10 (under-fill blob); row3 col17=3 correct but row4 col17=4 expected (wrong last-col prop for color4 row); row8 col9=0 generated but 7 expected (missed vertical from row7).
 * Train2: Generated over-fills row1 col9-10=4,4 but expected 0,0; row2 col10=4 but 7 expected (wrong color prop); row4 col7=4 but 0 expected; row5 col9=4 but 5 expected (misplaced 5); row6 col13-14=0,0 but expected 0,0 correct, but overall pattern mismatches border extensions.
 * Train3: Generated row6 col12=6 but 0 expected (over-fill right of 6); row6 col10=0 but 6 expected (under-fill 6 blob); row7 col12=6 but 0 expected (vertical over-prop).
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; current program lacks blob detection (e.g., connected components for colors like 7s or 4s) which could help complete shapes.
 * Function `program` overall is a good skeleton (copies grid, handles n<3) but broken in special filling bounds/logic (e.g., l/r ranges too narrow, ignores wider objects); find_spine helpful but may pick wrong col if ties; find_specials useful but misses if specials in bottom row or non-top.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., consistent 3s in col4 middles as potential spine, last-col fills like 9s/3s/4s/6s match row colors in col5; some clearings left of col4 to 0s; vertical fills like row7 col19=3 from row6) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Issues: Under-fills apparent blobs, e.g., row6 col5=3, col9=3, col10=3, col11=3 but col12=0 (likely needs horizontal extension to match expected 3 blob from border); row7 col14-16=4,4,4 correct but row8 col14-16=4,4,4 overwrites? Wait, generated has them as 4s but if forbidden, should clear—unclear without rules, but pattern suggests row8 col10=0 should fill to 3? from row7 col10=3.
 * Over-fills or misses: row3 col5-9=1,1,1,1,0 but top has 1 at col7, suggests special at col7=1, but generated row3 col9=0 (under-fill right); row12 col1=7 but top/middle suggest 7s in left cols, possibly forbidden clear missed; row13 col19=9 correct but row11 col19=9 from prop, yet row10 col17=0 but expected 6 extension from row9 col15-17=4,6,6? (wait, color mismatch).
 * Test has irregular features (e.g., 8s in row13-14 col2-3, 7s in row12 col1/3, multiple 9 blobs in top/bottom), so output misses completing 9s in middles (e.g., row1-2 col5=9 but col6=0 generated, likely needs fill); 1 in row3 col7 propagates poorly (only row3 col5-8=1s, but row12 col5=1 suggests vertical but not filled). Does not account for potential multi-specials or color-specific widths (e.g., 6 in row9 col15-17 needs wider prop than 1-col).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle (i.e., present in train input/output 1, 2, and 3). I focused only on elements with clear, repeatable effects or dependencies (e.g., position relative to other elements triggers a transformation). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., staying components with no change or connection, like most right-side blocks or bottom Dark Red blobs in examples 1 and 3) are excluded. Non-consistent elements (e.g., the disappearing low Dark Red blob in example 2 with no analog in 1 or 3; new Dark Red growth in examples 1 and 2 without a match in 3) are not included. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted—only direct, observable links are listed. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained (e.g., exact position shift), it is noted as unknown.

- **Vertical strip (tall, one-column component, e.g., Red at x=3 in example 1, Red at x=5 in example 2, Blue at x=3 in example 3) interacts with left-side components (x < vertical strip's x) via transport to right side (x > vertical strip's x)**: 
  - Affects: Connected components (blobs or singles) positioned entirely to the left of the vertical strip.
  - Effect: The left-side component(s) disappear from the left and reappear on the right, preserving color and exact pixel count (size). This happens to at least one such component in every example (Yellow 5-pixel blob in 1; multiple 1-pixel Orange components totaling 4 pixels in 2; Green 5-pixel blob in 3; plus 4 1-pixel Pink components in 3).
  - Consistent properties: Position (left of vertical) → transformation (removal + right-side addition); color preserved; pixels preserved per component (no size change or splitting).
  - Unknown: Exact new position on right (always mid-height y≈3-7, x shifted rightward, but shift distance varies: +8 in x and +3 in y for example 1; variable for singles in 2 and 3); no consistent shape rotation or mirroring observed.
  - No effect on right-side components unless merged (see below).

- **Transported components (from left-to-right via vertical strip) interact with same-color components on the right via potential merging**:
  - Affects: Only if the transported component lands adjacent to an existing same-color component on the right.
  - Effect: Merging into a single larger component if adjacent and same color (pixels add up). Observed in example 3 (transported 1-pixel Pinks merge with existing right-side Pink at [13,6] to form [12,13,6] with 2 pixels); no merge in examples 1 or 2 (transported components land isolated). Non-adjacent components remain separate.
  - Consistent properties: Same color + adjacent position (post-transport) → combined bbox and added pixels into one component.
  - Unknown: Exact conditions for adjacency (depends on unknown position mapping); merging not forced if not adjacent.

No other interactions (e.g., color changes, vertical strip modification, downward movement without transport, or hole/edge effects) are consistent across all three examples. Elements like central void areas or far-right clusters show no observable interactions in the data. If more examples were provided, additional connections might emerge, but based on this, the vertical strip's role as a "divider/portal" for left-right transport is the primary consistent mechanism.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with numbers representing colors and 0s as empty cells) needs to be completed by propagating colors from top/bottom rows into middle rows based on structural patterns like vertical "spines" (consistent color columns), horizontal "special" positions in the top row (unique colors differing from neighbors), and grouping/processing rules to fill shapes or connections without overwriting existing cells or violating forbidden color rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns; top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows provide pattern templates that propagate downward into middle rows (1 to n-2), but only where cells are 0; existing non-zero cells must be respected.
 * Identify a "spine" as a column j where middle rows have the most consistent non-zero color (all same and non-zero); use the next column (j+1) as a "row_color_col" for vertical propagation to the right edge (column m-1).
 * "Forbidden" colors are those appearing in top/bottom rows from the spine onward; clear them from middle rows left of the spine to avoid conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color is non-zero and differs from both immediate neighbors (j-1 and j+1); these trigger horizontal or vertical fillings.
 * Group consecutive specials into clusters; single specials or non-pairs fill horizontally around them in qualifying middle rows (rows with matching color at row_color_col, and row index <= max special column), but skip centers conditionally (e.g., if top row has <2 of that color and not at grid center).
 * For pairs of consecutive specials (glen==2), apply special filling: propagate downward with gaps, fill adjacent cells (e.g., +1 column), and handle vertical extensions above/below if zero.
 * Subtleties: Fillings must check bounds (1 <= row <= n-2, etc.); for pairs, ensure exactly one qualifying row per color with specific spacing (e.g., h2 == h1 + 2); near-end specials (j+1 == m-2) avoid certain extensions; center filling (j == m//2) is forced; pairs override some skips.
 * Collect row-color mappings (r_cs) from middle rows at row_color_col for qualifying homes; only fill if exact match in count and position.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation to right edge only if middle row color at row_color_col is non-zero; clear left-side forbidden colors only if they match top/bottom from spine rightward; for non-pairs, horizontal fill range is l = max(row_color_col+1, j-1) to r = min(m-2, j+1), but skip center if conditions met and it was zero, then potentially fill vertically in adjacent rows.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes shape completion (e.g., blobs, lines) without expansion beyond patterns, respecting vertical consistency and horizontal uniqueness.

                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * process_group: Overly complex and buggy; mishandles pair vs. non-pair logic, leading to overfilling (e.g., extra verticals or horizontals); the skipped_center vertical fill ignores bounds properly but applies too broadly; color_specials defaultdict groups by top color but doesn't validate against expected shapes.
 * The pair-specific logic in main program (after process_group for glen==2): Attempts gap filling (h1+1) and lower extensions (h2+1 with jj range), but conditions like qual_h2[0] == qual_h1[0] + 2 are too rigid and fail when rows aren't exactly spaced; also fills j1+3 which may exceed patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of spine detection, forbidden clearing, and special grouping, but fails on precise filling rules, leading to overfills, underfills, or misplaced colors in all training cases.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly places a 4 at row0 col1 (should be 0, as top row patterns shouldn't propagate left/upward); also minor overfill in row4 col4 (3 instead of 4? but grids match closely otherwise); underfills or skips some vertical extensions in rows 5-7 for color 4/7 blobs; the spine (likely col3=2) propagates correctly to right edge, but specials (e.g., around col5=3, col9=4, col10=7) trigger wrong horizontal ranges, missing expected 0s in some centers.
 * Train 1 mismatches top row integrity for unknown reason (extra 4 at start, possibly from unhandled propagation); bottom row also has extra 4 at col1, symmetric error; process_group fills too many horizontals in non-pair groups, but pair handling (if any) is absent here.
 * Train 2: Generated overfills top/bottom rows with 5 at col1 (expected 0s); underfills row1/8 with 4s instead of patterned 7s at col7/11; row5 has 5s but expected more sparse 5s with 0s; row6 underfills 5s; specials (e.g., col9=5, col11=7) group poorly, leading to missing vertical 7s in rows 1/3/7/9 and horizontal 7s in row1 col7; pair logic (cols 7-8=7s? but top has 4,7,4) fails spacing check, so no gap fills.
 * Train 2 has broken forbidden clearing (allows 5s left of spine); extract-like r_cs works for color 3/4 but not 5/7/8; process_group skips centers incorrectly, filling extras like row2 col14=0 to 7 (expected 0).
 * Train 3: Generated overfills row2 col7=0 to 3 (expected 0, but row3 has 3s); underfills row5 col7=0 (expected 3? no, expected has 3 only in row3); row6 has 6 at col4 but expected vertical 6s sparse; row7 underfills col11=0 to 6 (expected 6); row8 overfills left with 7s at col0-2 (expected full 7s but pattern is horizontal bar); specials (col7=3, col11=6) not filling downward correctly for color 3 in row5.
 * Train 3 mismatches blob shapes for 3/6 (unknown reason, possibly wrong l/r ranges in process_group); pair handling absent, but no pairs here; find_spine likely picks col3=1 correctly, but propagation misses vertical skips.
 * Across attempts: Spine and r_cs collection work well (consistent verticals for main color like 3); grouping specials catches uniques but processing overfills horizontals (e.g., filling beyond j-1 to j+1); pair code is untriggered or buggy (no exact h1/h2 spacing); forbidden set clears left side partially but misses top/bottom symmetries.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overpropagates color 9 vertically in many middle rows (e.g., rows 1-2,5-6,11-12 all have 9 at col5, but expected likely sparser based on top pattern [...,9,9,1,9,...] suggesting 1 as a special interrupt); underfills horizontals for color 1 in row3 (fills 1s at col5-8, but col9+ should be 0 unless grouped); row6 has 3s at col5-9 but top has no 3 special there (top col5=3? wait, top row0 col4=3, but specials start after spine); row13 has 1 at col5 but vertical from top col7=1? inconsistent.
 * Missing vertical extensions for 4/6 in rows 7-8/9-10 (only partial, expected full blobs like in train2); overfills row14 bottom with 9s everywhere rightward, ignoring specials like col6=8, col16=6; spine likely col4=3, row_color_col=5, but propagation to col19=9 everywhere ignores forbidden (top has 1,4,6,8); no pair handling visible (e.g., cols16-17=6,9? not filled as pair); overall, looks like aggressive 9-filling from top patterns without respecting uniqueness or gaps, making shapes blob into unintended merges (e.g., 9s connecting across 1/3 barriers).

[2025-10-01 02:06:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated colors in top row (differs from left/right neighbors) after row_color_col, up to m-2.
    # Useful for detecting seed points to fill middle rows, but limited to post-spine and may miss left or end cases.

            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-filling puzzle where colors from the top and bottom rows propagate into the middle rows based on patterns, likely forming "objects" or "blobs" guided by a central "spine" column of consistent color, with rules for filling adjacent cells, avoiding forbidden colors, and handling special transition points in the top row. The goal is to complete the grid by filling zeros with appropriate colors while preserving existing non-zero cells and ensuring symmetry or pattern matching across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) that has the most consistent non-zero color; if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column—subtlety: this spine guides propagation to the rightmost column but only if it's not at the edge.
 * Propagate the color from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) to the last column (m-1) in middle rows, but only for non-zero values.
 * Clear "forbidden" colors in left-side columns (0 to spine-1) of middle rows if those colors appear non-zero in the top or bottom rows from spine to end—this prevents overlap or invalid extensions, but it's easy to miss that forbidden is a set of colors from borders only in right half.
 * Group "specials": these are columns in the top row (from row_color_col+1 to m-2) where the color changes from neighbors (c != left and c != right), indicating starts/ends of patterns; subtlety: group consecutive specials into clusters, and handle singles vs. groups differently (e.g., singles may skip centers under conditions, groups of 2 get extra 3-wide fills in adjacent rows).
 * For filling: Use "homes" (middle rows with the special's color in row_color_col) to fill 3-wide horizontal strips (left=max(row_color_col, j-1) to right=min(m-2, j+1)) in those rows and vertically in adjacent rows (±1), but only zeros and avoiding skips for certain cases; for groups >1, treat as expanded fills without center skips, and for glen=2 add extra 3-wide in adj rows for the second.
 * Subtlety: Half-point (m//2) influences skipping centers for single specials if the color appears only once right of center; also, homes are filtered by row index <= special column j, suggesting left-to-right propagation bias.
 * Border rows (0 and n-1) should remain mostly unchanged except possibly clearing or matching, but code doesn't alter them much—easy to miss that top/bottom guide but aren't filled into.
 * Edge cases: Grids <3 rows return unchanged; no spine or invalid spine returns copy; non-consecutive specials form separate groups; all-zero columns in specials ignored.
 * General: Preserve all existing non-zeros; fills only to zeros; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; patterns seem to form vertical/horizontal extensions of top-row blobs into middle, like a "shadow" or "support" structure.

                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function is helpful for identifying the guiding spine column based on consistency in middle rows.)

```python
def find_specials(grid_out: List[List[int]], rcc: int, mm: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(rcc + 1, mm - 1):
        c = grid_out[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid_out[0][j - 1] and c != grid_out[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special

def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(These are useful for detecting and clustering transition points in the top row, essential for targeted filling.)

```python
r_cs = defaultdict(list)
for i in middle_rows:
    c = g_out[i][row_color_col]
    if c != 0:
        r_cs[c].append(i)
```
(This defaultdict collects "homes" per color from the row_color_col, key for selecting rows to fill.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the spine in all training examples (e.g., likely column 4 with color 3 in Train 1), propagates to the last column accurately (e.g., ends with 3/4/7/6 as expected), and clears some forbidden left-side cells (e.g., zeros out many left positions in middle rows).
 * What worked: Grouping specials correctly detects transitions (e.g., in Train 1, specials around columns for 6,4,7,6 changes); basic 3-wide fills for singles and groups partially match, like filling 4/7 blobs in rows 4-7 of Train 1; vertical propagation to adj rows works in places (e.g., row 6 in Train 1 gets 7s).
 * What didn't work: Over-fills or incorrect fills in unexpected places, e.g., in Train 1, top row (row 0) position 1 filled with 4 (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]), and row 11 position 1 also 4 vs 0—suggests unintended border modification or propagation leak; in row 4 of Train 1, position 8 has 4 but expected 0? Wait, actually rows 0-11 generated vs expected show minor diffs like row 4 pos 4:4 vs 4 (match), but overall mismatches in left fills.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 4s in top/bottom left (pos 1), and row 5 pos 17:3 vs expected 3 (match?), but row 9 pos 4:6 vs 6 (match)—diffs mainly in borders and some middle left (e.g., row 3 pos 9:4 vs 0? No, row 3: [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] vs expected same, wait—actually close but says INCORRECT, likely subtle like row 4 pos 8:4 vs 0? Upon close check, generated row 4 has pos 8:4 but expected pos 8:0 in some? No, expected row 4: [0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]—yes, pos 8:4 matches, but perhaps row 0/11 extras are the issue; unknown why borders got filled.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated fills too many 4s/7s in middle, e.g., row 1 pos 9-11:4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0; row 2 pos 10:4 vs 7; row 4 pos 7-12:0,4,4,4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0,5,0,0; row 5 pos 5:5 vs 5 (match), but row 6 pos 9:5 vs 5 (match)—over-filling groups without proper skipping or home filtering; also top row pos 1:5 vs 0.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated top row pos 1:3 vs 0; row 1 pos 7:0 vs 0 (match), but row 2 pos 7:3 vs 3 (match?); row 6 pos 13:6 vs 6 (match), but row 8 pos 0-2:7,7,7 vs 7,7,7 (match)—diffs in left fills like row 0 pos 1:3 vs 0, and some middle like row 3 pos 4:3 vs 3 (match), but row 6 pos 4:6 vs 6; seems extra border fills and incomplete clears (e.g., row 9 pos 1-3:0,0,0 vs 0,0,0).
 * Overall: The filling logic for groups (esp. glen=2 with extra adj fills) over-extends horizontally/vertically, ignoring some zero preservations; skip_center logic doesn't trigger properly (e.g., in Train 1 single 6 at pos 6?); home filtering (ii <= j) may be too restrictive or not applied consistently; no extraction of full "objects" or blobs, so misses holistic shape matching—consider adding a function to validate blob connectivity post-fill.
 * Function find_spine is helpful and seems accurate; find_specials and group_specials are useful but may mis-detect if top row has zeros or plateaus; r_cs is essential for per-color homes but could be enhanced to check vertical consistency; the glen>=3 handling as "non-skipping singles" works partially but leads to fragmented fills; no unhelpful functions, but the complex if-else for groups is brittle—easy to miss that for glen=2, first special gets standard fill but second gets extra adj 3-wide, which overfills in Train 2.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits issues from the training failures: e.g., top row (row 0) has pos 1:1 vs likely expected 0 (similar to Train 1/2/3 border overfills); row 12 pos 1:7 vs probably 0; row 14 has many 9s in right but left pos 6-19 overfilled with 9s where patterns like 1-blob or 3/4/6 should be sparser.
 * Middle rows show partial propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3s around pos 5-11, matching a potential 3-blob; row 7-9 have 4s in pos 13-16, good for a 4-group), but overfills like row 3 pos 6-9:1,1,1,1 vs likely narrower (expected might zero some based on top 1 at pos 7); row 10 pos 14-16:6,6,6 good, but row 5 pos 10:3 vs possibly 0 if not a home.
 * Right column (pos 19) consistently filled with 9/1/3/4/6/9 as per propagation, which makes sense if spine is col 4 (3s), but left clears are incomplete (e.g., row 2 pos 7:1 but if 1 forbidden from top, should be 0); vertical fills in adj rows seem spotty, e.g., row 7 pos 5:4 but row 6/8 pos 5:3/0 mismatch.
 * Overall, it partially forms blobs (e.g., 9s in rows 1-2,5,11-14 right-side), but extras like row 14 pos 6:8 (from top?) and missing sparsity in 1/3 areas suggest wrong special grouping or skip logic—does not match expected holistic patterns, likely needs better forbidden application and group handling to avoid dense overfills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero cells (empty spaces) with appropriate color numbers based on patterns, symmetries, and propagation rules across rows and columns, likely simulating object placement or contour filling in a 2D scene with top/bottom borders and middle "body" rows that extend or match colors from a central "spine" structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that act as fixed borders or outlines, while middle rows (1 to n-2) are where most filling/propagation occurs, often mirroring or extending patterns from these borders without overwriting non-zero cells.
 * Identify a "spine" column (or near it) in middle rows where a single consistent non-zero color dominates vertically; this serves as an anchor for horizontal propagation to the right (e.g., filling the last column with the spine's color) and vertical influences.
 * "Forbidden" colors are collected from top/bottom rows to the right of the spine and used to clear conflicting colors to the left of the spine in middle rows, ensuring no bleed-over from border patterns.
 * "Special" columns are isolated non-zero cells in the top row that differ from immediate neighbors (e.g., peaks or isolated features); these trigger targeted filling in middle rows for matching colors, often limited to homes (rows) associated with that color and propagating horizontally within bounds (e.g., j-1 to j+1, but adjusted near edges) and vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Color "homes" are middle rows grouped by their color in a key column (spine+1), and filling for specials is restricted to homes "below" or at the special's position (e.g., ii <= j), suggesting a downward or positional hierarchy.
 * Propagation is conservative: only fill zeros, avoid overwriting existing non-zeros, and respect grid edges (e.g., no filling beyond m-2 or before spine+1 in some cases); vertical propagation is limited to immediate adjacent rows (dr = -1,1) and only if target is zero.
 * Subtleties: Spine detection prioritizes columns with the most consistent non-zero color in middle rows, falling back to any uniform non-zero; specials skip edge cases (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2). Filling for specials may need to extend further right/left in some cases (e.g., for wider objects like the 7s in train1 row5/6/7). Edge handling is critical near m-3 or later, where left bounds shift rightward. No filling if n<3. Patterns suggest symmetry or object completion (e.g., filling blobs like 7s horizontally across multiple columns if aligned).
 * Across attempts, over-filling or under-filling occurs: e.g., missing horizontal extensions for colors like 7 in train1 (row5 col11=7 expected but 0 generated), incorrect vertical fills (train3 row6 col12=0 expected but 6 generated), or misplaced propagations (train2 row4 col7=0 expected but 4 generated). Test grid shows complex interactions with multiple colors (3,9,1,4,6,7,8) and potential multi-spine or irregular objects.

    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies spines in simple cases (e.g., col4 with color 3 in train1/2/3 middles) and propagates last-column fills accurately (e.g., all 3s in train1 middles col17).
 * What worked: Clearing forbidden colors left of spine (e.g., train1 row1-11 col0-3 cleared to 0 where conflicting); basic home grouping by color in row_color_col (spine+1); vertical propagation for specials in adjacent rows if zero (e.g., train3 row7 col11=6 from row6).
 * What didn't work: Under-fills horizontal extensions for specials (train1 row5 col12=0 generated but 7 expected; train1 row7 col9-11=7,7,7 expected but partial/missing); over-fills or misplaces in specials (train2 row4 col7=4 generated but 0 expected; train2 row2 col10=4 generated but 7 expected); incorrect spine fallback or special bounds (train3 row6 col12=6 generated but 0 expected, possibly from over-propagation of 6 homes).
 * Train1: Generated misses 7s in row5 col12, row7 col9-10 (under-fill blob); row3 col17=3 correct but row4 col17=4 expected (wrong last-col prop for color4 row); row8 col9=0 generated but 7 expected (missed vertical from row7).
 * Train2: Generated over-fills row1 col9-10=4,4 but expected 0,0; row2 col10=4 but 7 expected (wrong color prop); row4 col7=4 but 0 expected; row5 col9=4 but 5 expected (misplaced 5); row6 col13-14=0,0 but expected 0,0 correct, but overall pattern mismatches border extensions.
 * Train3: Generated row6 col12=6 but 0 expected (over-fill right of 6); row6 col10=0 but 6 expected (under-fill 6 blob); row7 col12=6 but 0 expected (vertical over-prop).
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; current program lacks blob detection (e.g., connected components for colors like 7s or 4s) which could help complete shapes.
 * Function `program` overall is a good skeleton (copies grid, handles n<3) but broken in special filling bounds/logic (e.g., l/r ranges too narrow, ignores wider objects); find_spine helpful but may pick wrong col if ties; find_specials useful but misses if specials in bottom row or non-top.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., consistent 3s in col4 middles as potential spine, last-col fills like 9s/3s/4s/6s match row colors in col5; some clearings left of col4 to 0s; vertical fills like row7 col19=3 from row6) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Issues: Under-fills apparent blobs, e.g., row6 col5=3, col9=3, col10=3, col11=3 but col12=0 (likely needs horizontal extension to match expected 3 blob from border); row7 col14-16=4,4,4 correct but row8 col14-16=4,4,4 overwrites? Wait, generated has them as 4s but if forbidden, should clear—unclear without rules, but pattern suggests row8 col10=0 should fill to 3? from row7 col10=3.
 * Over-fills or misses: row3 col5-9=1,1,1,1,0 but top has 1 at col7, suggests special at col7=1, but generated row3 col9=0 (under-fill right); row12 col1=7 but top/middle suggest 7s in left cols, possibly forbidden clear missed; row13 col19=9 correct but row11 col19=9 from prop, yet row10 col17=0 but expected 6 extension from row9 col15-17=4,6,6? (wait, color mismatch).
 * Test has irregular features (e.g., 8s in row13-14 col2-3, 7s in row12 col1/3, multiple 9 blobs in top/bottom), so output misses completing 9s in middles (e.g., row1-2 col5=9 but col6=0 generated, likely needs fill); 1 in row3 col7 propagates poorly (only row3 col5-8=1s, but row12 col5=1 suggests vertical but not filled). Does not account for potential multi-specials or color-specific widths (e.g., 6 in row9 col15-17 needs wider prop than 1-col).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with numbers representing colors and 0s as empty cells) needs to be completed by propagating colors from top/bottom rows into middle rows based on structural patterns like vertical "spines" (consistent color columns), horizontal "special" positions in the top row (unique colors differing from neighbors), and grouping/processing rules to fill shapes or connections without overwriting existing cells or violating forbidden color rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns; top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows provide pattern templates that propagate downward into middle rows (1 to n-2), but only where cells are 0; existing non-zero cells must be respected.
 * Identify a "spine" as a column j where middle rows have the most consistent non-zero color (all same and non-zero); use the next column (j+1) as a "row_color_col" for vertical propagation to the right edge (column m-1).
 * "Forbidden" colors are those appearing in top/bottom rows from the spine onward; clear them from middle rows left of the spine to avoid conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color is non-zero and differs from both immediate neighbors (j-1 and j+1); these trigger horizontal or vertical fillings.
 * Group consecutive specials into clusters; single specials or non-pairs fill horizontally around them in qualifying middle rows (rows with matching color at row_color_col, and row index <= max special column), but skip centers conditionally (e.g., if top row has <2 of that color and not at grid center).
 * For pairs of consecutive specials (glen==2), apply special filling: propagate downward with gaps, fill adjacent cells (e.g., +1 column), and handle vertical extensions above/below if zero.
 * Subtleties: Fillings must check bounds (1 <= row <= n-2, etc.); for pairs, ensure exactly one qualifying row per color with specific spacing (e.g., h2 == h1 + 2); near-end specials (j+1 == m-2) avoid certain extensions; center filling (j == m//2) is forced; pairs override some skips.
 * Collect row-color mappings (r_cs) from middle rows at row_color_col for qualifying homes; only fill if exact match in count and position.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation to right edge only if middle row color at row_color_col is non-zero; clear left-side forbidden colors only if they match top/bottom from spine rightward; for non-pairs, horizontal fill range is l = max(row_color_col+1, j-1) to r = min(m-2, j+1), but skip center if conditions met and it was zero, then potentially fill vertically in adjacent rows.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes shape completion (e.g., blobs, lines) without expansion beyond patterns, respecting vertical consistency and horizontal uniqueness.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * process_group: Overly complex and buggy; mishandles pair vs. non-pair logic, leading to overfilling (e.g., extra verticals or horizontals); the skipped_center vertical fill ignores bounds properly but applies too broadly; color_specials defaultdict groups by top color but doesn't validate against expected shapes.
 * The pair-specific logic in main program (after process_group for glen==2): Attempts gap filling (h1+1) and lower extensions (h2+1 with jj range), but conditions like qual_h2[0] == qual_h1[0] + 2 are too rigid and fail when rows aren't exactly spaced; also fills j1+3 which may exceed patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of spine detection, forbidden clearing, and special grouping, but fails on precise filling rules, leading to overfills, underfills, or misplaced colors in all training cases.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly places a 4 at row0 col1 (should be 0, as top row patterns shouldn't propagate left/upward); also minor overfill in row4 col4 (3 instead of 4? but grids match closely otherwise); underfills or skips some vertical extensions in rows 5-7 for color 4/7 blobs; the spine (likely col3=2) propagates correctly to right edge, but specials (e.g., around col5=3, col9=4, col10=7) trigger wrong horizontal ranges, missing expected 0s in some centers.
 * Train 1 mismatches top row integrity for unknown reason (extra 4 at start, possibly from unhandled propagation); bottom row also has extra 4 at col1, symmetric error; process_group fills too many horizontals in non-pair groups, but pair handling (if any) is absent here.
 * Train 2: Generated overfills top/bottom rows with 5 at col1 (expected 0s); underfills row1/8 with 4s instead of patterned 7s at col7/11; row5 has 5s but expected more sparse 5s with 0s; row6 underfills 5s; specials (e.g., col9=5, col11=7) group poorly, leading to missing vertical 7s in rows 1/3/7/9 and horizontal 7s in row1 col7; pair logic (cols 7-8=7s? but top has 4,7,4) fails spacing check, so no gap fills.
 * Train 2 has broken forbidden clearing (allows 5s left of spine); extract-like r_cs works for color 3/4 but not 5/7/8; process_group skips centers incorrectly, filling extras like row2 col14=0 to 7 (expected 0).
 * Train 3: Generated overfills row2 col7=0 to 3 (expected 0, but row3 has 3s); underfills row5 col7=0 (expected 3? no, expected has 3 only in row3); row6 has 6 at col4 but expected vertical 6s sparse; row7 underfills col11=0 to 6 (expected 6); row8 overfills left with 7s at col0-2 (expected full 7s but pattern is horizontal bar); specials (col7=3, col11=6) not filling downward correctly for color 3 in row5.
 * Train 3 mismatches blob shapes for 3/6 (unknown reason, possibly wrong l/r ranges in process_group); pair handling absent, but no pairs here; find_spine likely picks col3=1 correctly, but propagation misses vertical skips.
 * Across attempts: Spine and r_cs collection work well (consistent verticals for main color like 3); grouping specials catches uniques but processing overfills horizontals (e.g., filling beyond j-1 to j+1); pair code is untriggered or buggy (no exact h1/h2 spacing); forbidden set clears left side partially but misses top/bottom symmetries.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overpropagates color 9 vertically in many middle rows (e.g., rows 1-2,5-6,11-12 all have 9 at col5, but expected likely sparser based on top pattern [...,9,9,1,9,...] suggesting 1 as a special interrupt); underfills horizontals for color 1 in row3 (fills 1s at col5-8, but col9+ should be 0 unless grouped); row6 has 3s at col5-9 but top has no 3 special there (top col5=3? wait, top row0 col4=3, but specials start after spine); row13 has 1 at col5 but vertical from top col7=1? inconsistent.
 * Missing vertical extensions for 4/6 in rows 7-8/9-10 (only partial, expected full blobs like in train2); overfills row14 bottom with 9s everywhere rightward, ignoring specials like col6=8, col16=6; spine likely col4=3, row_color_col=5, but propagation to col19=9 everywhere ignores forbidden (top has 1,4,6,8); no pair handling visible (e.g., cols16-17=6,9? not filled as pair); overall, looks like aggressive 9-filling from top patterns without respecting uniqueness or gaps, making shapes blob into unintended merges (e.g., 9s connecting across 1/3 barriers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by prioritizing maximum uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with a fallback for any uniform column; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:12:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by numbers, with 0 as empty) where the goal is to fill in empty cells (zeros) based on propagation rules from a central "spine" column in the middle rows, while respecting forbidden colors from the top and bottom borders, and specially handling isolated or grouped unique colors in the top row to extend them downward and sideways into empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The spine is a column (often around the middle) that must have the most uniform non-zero color across middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in the top or bottom row to the right of the spine; these must be cleared (set to 0) from all positions left of the spine across the entire grid to prevent invalid propagation.
 * After identifying the spine, propagate its color (from row_color_col = spine + 1) to the rightmost column in all middle rows where it's non-zero.
 * Special "potential" columns are isolated top-row colors (non-zero, different from left and right neighbors) to the right of row_color_col; group consecutive ones and handle singles (fill adjacent empties in qualifying middle rows) or pairs (similar but extended vertically) differently, with skips for center positions if isolated and post-half grid.
 * Qualifying rows for propagation are middle rows (1 to n-2) that have the color in row_color_col, but only those <= the special column index for horizontal fills.
 * Horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of the special column (or from row_color_col+1), vertical fills go up/down 1 row from qualifying rows but only into empties, and for pairs, vertical also fills horizontal neighbors in those offset rows.
 * Subtle: For singles post-half grid with count 1, skip filling the center (k==j) to avoid overfill; for groups >2, treat as singles without skip. Ensure no overwriting of non-zeros.
 * Grid edges (rows 0 and n-1, columns 0 and m-1) are borders and not filled in middle propagation; n<3 grids unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only into zeros, not overwriting; r_cs tracks middle rows per color in row_color_col for qualifiers; isol_count tracks how many potentials per color to filter true isolates (those matching total top-right count).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine column by maximizing uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with fallback; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This groups consecutive isolated top-row positions, essential for distinguishing single/pair/multi handling.)

```python
def handle_single(g: List[List[int]], j: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter, skip_center: bool = True):
    c = g[0][j]
    qual = [i for i in r_cs.get(c, []) if i <= j]
    do_skip = skip_center and (j > half) and (count_c[c] == 1)
    l = max(row_color_col + 1, j - 1)
    r = min(m - 2, j + 1)
    for i in qual:
        for k in range(l, r + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0 and not (do_skip and k == j):
                g[i][k] = c
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1 and g[ii][j] == 0:
                g[ii][j] = c
```
(This handles single isolated top colors by filling horizontal/vertical empties in qualifying rows; skip_center prevents overfill in late isolates. Helpful for core filling logic.)

```python
def handle_pair(g: List[List[int]], j1: int, j2: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter):
    c1 = g[0][j1]
    c2 = g[0][j2]
    qual1 = [i for i in r_cs.get(c1, []) if i <= j1]
    l1 = max(row_color_col + 1, j1 - 1)
    r1 = min(m - 2, j1 + 1)
    for i in qual1:
        for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0:
                g[i][k] = c1
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1:
                for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
                    if g[ii][k] == 0:
                        g[ii][k] = c1
    # Similar block for c2, qual2, l2, r2 (omitted for brevity)
```
(This extends single logic to pairs, adding horizontal fill in vertical offsets; useful for grouped cases but note the incomplete vertical check in the provided code snippet—may need fix for g[ii][j2]==0.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly solved all three training examples, indicating strong handling of spine detection, forbidden color clearing, and basic propagation for standard cases.
 * Worked well: Uniform spine finding, grouping consecutives, filtering true isolates via count matching, and limited fills without overwriting.
 * Did not work fully: In the test output, propagation seems incomplete—e.g., row 3 has a run of 1's filled horizontally but no vertical extension below; row 6 has 3's in middle but zeros persist around them without full flood; forbidden clearing left some potential invalid colors (unknown if input had them).
 * Potential overfill or skip issues: do_skip in handle_single prevented center fills post-half, but in test, some late areas (e.g., columns 14-18 with 4,6,9) have partial fills missing adjacent zeros.
 * r_cs qualification (i <= j) may be too restrictive for test, as some middle rows >j have matching colors but aren't used, leaving empties (e.g., lower 9's not propagating up).
 * handle_pair has a bug: vertical dr loop lacks g[ii][j]==0 check (fills unconditionally if in bounds), and the provided code snippet cuts off qual2 handling—likely causes overfill or asymmetry in pairs.
 * Overall, the program understands core structure (spine, isolates, propagation) but misses nuances in vertical extension for pairs and qualifier filtering, leading to underfill in complex test grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., column 4 all 3's propagated from spine; top row isolates like 1 at col7 filled down to row3; 4's and 6's in cols14-17 partially extended horizontally/vertically), which makes sense for basic rules but looks incomplete and incorrect overall.
 * Observed: Many zeros remain in middle/right areas (e.g., rows 2-5, cols6-13 mostly zero except sparse 1's and 9's; row10 has 6's but no fill left/right beyond; bottom rows 12-14 have minimal changes, missing expected propagation from top 9's or 1's).
 * Differences from expected: Expected fuller fills based on patterns (e.g., the 1 in row2 col7 should propagate more vertically/horizontally via qualifiers, but stops abruptly; 8 in row14 col6 and 3's in row14 cols10-11 suggest unpaired fills missing; top-right 9's dominate but don't flood lower empties as in training). It underfills compared to likely complete solution, possibly due to strict i<=j in qualifiers or pair handling bug—e.g., no clear pair grouping visible in output.
 * Does not look fully correct: Leaves isolated zeros in propagate-able areas (e.g., around row7 col19=3, should extend left), and some fills like row3 cols5-9=3,1,1,1,1 seem arbitrary/not matching color source; unknown why bottom row14 mirrors top but with extras like 8,1,9's not cleared if forbidden.

[2025-10-01 02:12:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds column j in middle_rows with most uniform non-zero color (max_count of same color), or first uniform non-zero if none.
    # Helpful for identifying central propagation anchor, but may need refinement for ties or partial uniformity.
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated colors in top row (differs from left/right neighbors) after row_color_col, up to m-2.
    # Useful for detecting seed points to fill middle rows, but limited to post-spine and may miss left or end cases.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-filling puzzle where colors from the top and bottom rows propagate into the middle rows based on patterns, likely forming "objects" or "blobs" guided by a central "spine" column of consistent color, with rules for filling adjacent cells, avoiding forbidden colors, and handling special transition points in the top row. The goal is to complete the grid by filling zeros with appropriate colors while preserving existing non-zero cells and ensuring symmetry or pattern matching across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) that has the most consistent non-zero color; if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column—subtlety: this spine guides propagation to the rightmost column but only if it's not at the edge.
 * Propagate the color from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) to the last column (m-1) in middle rows, but only for non-zero values.
 * Clear "forbidden" colors in left-side columns (0 to spine-1) of middle rows if those colors appear non-zero in the top or bottom rows from spine to end—this prevents overlap or invalid extensions, but it's easy to miss that forbidden is a set of colors from borders only in right half.
 * Group "specials": these are columns in the top row (from row_color_col+1 to m-2) where the color changes from neighbors (c != left and c != right), indicating starts/ends of patterns; subtlety: group consecutive specials into clusters, and handle singles vs. groups differently (e.g., singles may skip centers under conditions, groups of 2 get extra 3-wide fills in adjacent rows).
 * For filling: Use "homes" (middle rows with the special's color in row_color_col) to fill 3-wide horizontal strips (left=max(row_color_col, j-1) to right=min(m-2, j+1)) in those rows and vertically in adjacent rows (±1), but only zeros and avoiding skips for certain cases; for groups >1, treat as expanded fills without center skips, and for glen=2 add extra 3-wide in adj rows for the second.
 * Subtlety: Half-point (m//2) influences skipping centers for single specials if the color appears only once right of center; also, homes are filtered by row index <= special column j, suggesting left-to-right propagation bias.
 * Border rows (0 and n-1) should remain mostly unchanged except possibly clearing or matching, but code doesn't alter them much—easy to miss that top/bottom guide but aren't filled into.
 * Edge cases: Grids <3 rows return unchanged; no spine or invalid spine returns copy; non-consecutive specials form separate groups; all-zero columns in specials ignored.
 * General: Preserve all existing non-zeros; fills only to zeros; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; patterns seem to form vertical/horizontal extensions of top-row blobs into middle, like a "shadow" or "support" structure.

                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function is helpful for identifying the guiding spine column based on consistency in middle rows.)

```python
def find_specials(grid_out: List[List[int]], rcc: int, mm: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(rcc + 1, mm - 1):
        c = grid_out[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid_out[0][j - 1] and c != grid_out[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special

def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(These are useful for detecting and clustering transition points in the top row, essential for targeted filling.)

```python
r_cs = defaultdict(list)
for i in middle_rows:
    c = g_out[i][row_color_col]
    if c != 0:
        r_cs[c].append(i)
```
(This defaultdict collects "homes" per color from the row_color_col, key for selecting rows to fill.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the spine in all training examples (e.g., likely column 4 with color 3 in Train 1), propagates to the last column accurately (e.g., ends with 3/4/7/6 as expected), and clears some forbidden left-side cells (e.g., zeros out many left positions in middle rows).
 * What worked: Grouping specials correctly detects transitions (e.g., in Train 1, specials around columns for 6,4,7,6 changes); basic 3-wide fills for singles and groups partially match, like filling 4/7 blobs in rows 4-7 of Train 1; vertical propagation to adj rows works in places (e.g., row 6 in Train 1 gets 7s).
 * What didn't work: Over-fills or incorrect fills in unexpected places, e.g., in Train 1, top row (row 0) position 1 filled with 4 (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]), and row 11 position 1 also 4 vs 0—suggests unintended border modification or propagation leak; in row 4 of Train 1, position 8 has 4 but expected 0? Wait, actually rows 0-11 generated vs expected show minor diffs like row 4 pos 4:4 vs 4 (match), but overall mismatches in left fills.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 4s in top/bottom left (pos 1), and row 5 pos 17:3 vs expected 3 (match?), but row 9 pos 4:6 vs 6 (match)—diffs mainly in borders and some middle left (e.g., row 3 pos 9:4 vs 0? No, row 3: [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] vs expected same, wait—actually close but says INCORRECT, likely subtle like row 4 pos 8:4 vs 0? Upon close check, generated row 4 has pos 8:4 but expected pos 8:0 in some? No, expected row 4: [0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]—yes, pos 8:4 matches, but perhaps row 0/11 extras are the issue; unknown why borders got filled.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated fills too many 4s/7s in middle, e.g., row 1 pos 9-11:4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0; row 2 pos 10:4 vs 7; row 4 pos 7-12:0,4,4,4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0,5,0,0; row 5 pos 5:5 vs 5 (match), but row 6 pos 9:5 vs 5 (match)—over-filling groups without proper skipping or home filtering; also top row pos 1:5 vs 0.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated top row pos 1:3 vs 0; row 1 pos 7:0 vs 0 (match), but row 2 pos 7:3 vs 3 (match?); row 6 pos 13:6 vs 6 (match), but row 8 pos 0-2:7,7,7 vs 7,7,7 (match)—diffs in left fills like row 0 pos 1:3 vs 0, and some middle like row 3 pos 4:3 vs 3 (match), but row 6 pos 4:6 vs 6; seems extra border fills and incomplete clears (e.g., row 9 pos 1-3:0,0,0 vs 0,0,0).
 * Overall: The filling logic for groups (esp. glen=2 with extra adj fills) over-extends horizontally/vertically, ignoring some zero preservations; skip_center logic doesn't trigger properly (e.g., in Train 1 single 6 at pos 6?); home filtering (ii <= j) may be too restrictive or not applied consistently; no extraction of full "objects" or blobs, so misses holistic shape matching—consider adding a function to validate blob connectivity post-fill.
 * Function find_spine is helpful and seems accurate; find_specials and group_specials are useful but may mis-detect if top row has zeros or plateaus; r_cs is essential for per-color homes but could be enhanced to check vertical consistency; the glen>=3 handling as "non-skipping singles" works partially but leads to fragmented fills; no unhelpful functions, but the complex if-else for groups is brittle—easy to miss that for glen=2, first special gets standard fill but second gets extra adj 3-wide, which overfills in Train 2.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits issues from the training failures: e.g., top row (row 0) has pos 1:1 vs likely expected 0 (similar to Train 1/2/3 border overfills); row 12 pos 1:7 vs probably 0; row 14 has many 9s in right but left pos 6-19 overfilled with 9s where patterns like 1-blob or 3/4/6 should be sparser.
 * Middle rows show partial propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3s around pos 5-11, matching a potential 3-blob; row 7-9 have 4s in pos 13-16, good for a 4-group), but overfills like row 3 pos 6-9:1,1,1,1 vs likely narrower (expected might zero some based on top 1 at pos 7); row 10 pos 14-16:6,6,6 good, but row 5 pos 10:3 vs possibly 0 if not a home.
 * Right column (pos 19) consistently filled with 9/1/3/4/6/9 as per propagation, which makes sense if spine is col 4 (3s), but left clears are incomplete (e.g., row 2 pos 7:1 but if 1 forbidden from top, should be 0); vertical fills in adj rows seem spotty, e.g., row 7 pos 5:4 but row 6/8 pos 5:3/0 mismatch.
 * Overall, it partially forms blobs (e.g., 9s in rows 1-2,5,11-14 right-side), but extras like row 14 pos 6:8 (from top?) and missing sparsity in 1/3 areas suggest wrong special grouping or skip logic—does not match expected holistic patterns, likely needs better forbidden application and group handling to avoid dense overfills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero cells (empty spaces) with appropriate color numbers based on patterns, symmetries, and propagation rules across rows and columns, likely simulating object placement or contour filling in a 2D scene with top/bottom borders and middle "body" rows that extend or match colors from a central "spine" structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that act as fixed borders or outlines, while middle rows (1 to n-2) are where most filling/propagation occurs, often mirroring or extending patterns from these borders without overwriting non-zero cells.
 * Identify a "spine" column (or near it) in middle rows where a single consistent non-zero color dominates vertically; this serves as an anchor for horizontal propagation to the right (e.g., filling the last column with the spine's color) and vertical influences.
 * "Forbidden" colors are collected from top/bottom rows to the right of the spine and used to clear conflicting colors to the left of the spine in middle rows, ensuring no bleed-over from border patterns.
 * "Special" columns are isolated non-zero cells in the top row that differ from immediate neighbors (e.g., peaks or isolated features); these trigger targeted filling in middle rows for matching colors, often limited to homes (rows) associated with that color and propagating horizontally within bounds (e.g., j-1 to j+1, but adjusted near edges) and vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Color "homes" are middle rows grouped by their color in a key column (spine+1), and filling for specials is restricted to homes "below" or at the special's position (e.g., ii <= j), suggesting a downward or positional hierarchy.
 * Propagation is conservative: only fill zeros, avoid overwriting existing non-zeros, and respect grid edges (e.g., no filling beyond m-2 or before spine+1 in some cases); vertical propagation is limited to immediate adjacent rows (dr = -1,1) and only if target is zero.
 * Subtleties: Spine detection prioritizes columns with the most consistent non-zero color in middle rows, falling back to any uniform non-zero; specials skip edge cases (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2). Filling for specials may need to extend further right/left in some cases (e.g., for wider objects like the 7s in train1 row5/6/7). Edge handling is critical near m-3 or later, where left bounds shift rightward. No filling if n<3. Patterns suggest symmetry or object completion (e.g., filling blobs like 7s horizontally across multiple columns if aligned).
 * Across attempts, over-filling or under-filling occurs: e.g., missing horizontal extensions for colors like 7 in train1 (row5 col11=7 expected but 0 generated), incorrect vertical fills (train3 row6 col12=0 expected but 6 generated), or misplaced propagations (train2 row4 col7=0 expected but 4 generated). Test grid shows complex interactions with multiple colors (3,9,1,4,6,7,8) and potential multi-spine or irregular objects.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                spine = j

        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]

                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated non-zero cells in top row differing from neighbors, starting after row_color_col.
    # Useful for detecting key features to propagate, but skips m-1 and assumes top row as reference.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies spines in simple cases (e.g., col4 with color 3 in train1/2/3 middles) and propagates last-column fills accurately (e.g., all 3s in train1 middles col17).
 * What worked: Clearing forbidden colors left of spine (e.g., train1 row1-11 col0-3 cleared to 0 where conflicting); basic home grouping by color in row_color_col (spine+1); vertical propagation for specials in adjacent rows if zero (e.g., train3 row7 col11=6 from row6).
 * What didn't work: Under-fills horizontal extensions for specials (train1 row5 col12=0 generated but 7 expected; train1 row7 col9-11=7,7,7 expected but partial/missing); over-fills or misplaces in specials (train2 row4 col7=4 generated but 0 expected; train2 row2 col10=4 generated but 7 expected); incorrect spine fallback or special bounds (train3 row6 col12=6 generated but 0 expected, possibly from over-propagation of 6 homes).
 * Train1: Generated misses 7s in row5 col12, row7 col9-10 (under-fill blob); row3 col17=3 correct but row4 col17=4 expected (wrong last-col prop for color4 row); row8 col9=0 generated but 7 expected (missed vertical from row7).
 * Train2: Generated over-fills row1 col9-10=4,4 but expected 0,0; row2 col10=4 but 7 expected (wrong color prop); row4 col7=4 but 0 expected; row5 col9=4 but 5 expected (misplaced 5); row6 col13-14=0,0 but expected 0,0 correct, but overall pattern mismatches border extensions.
 * Train3: Generated row6 col12=6 but 0 expected (over-fill right of 6); row6 col10=0 but 6 expected (under-fill 6 blob); row7 col12=6 but 0 expected (vertical over-prop).
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; current program lacks blob detection (e.g., connected components for colors like 7s or 4s) which could help complete shapes.
 * Function `program` overall is a good skeleton (copies grid, handles n<3) but broken in special filling bounds/logic (e.g., l/r ranges too narrow, ignores wider objects); find_spine helpful but may pick wrong col if ties; find_specials useful but misses if specials in bottom row or non-top.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., consistent 3s in col4 middles as potential spine, last-col fills like 9s/3s/4s/6s match row colors in col5; some clearings left of col4 to 0s; vertical fills like row7 col19=3 from row6) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Issues: Under-fills apparent blobs, e.g., row6 col5=3, col9=3, col10=3, col11=3 but col12=0 (likely needs horizontal extension to match expected 3 blob from border); row7 col14-16=4,4,4 correct but row8 col14-16=4,4,4 overwrites? Wait, generated has them as 4s but if forbidden, should clear—unclear without rules, but pattern suggests row8 col10=0 should fill to 3? from row7 col10=3.
 * Over-fills or misses: row3 col5-9=1,1,1,1,0 but top has 1 at col7, suggests special at col7=1, but generated row3 col9=0 (under-fill right); row12 col1=7 but top/middle suggest 7s in left cols, possibly forbidden clear missed; row13 col19=9 correct but row11 col19=9 from prop, yet row10 col17=0 but expected 6 extension from row9 col15-17=4,6,6? (wait, color mismatch).
 * Test has irregular features (e.g., 8s in row13-14 col2-3, 7s in row12 col1/3, multiple 9 blobs in top/bottom), so output misses completing 9s in middles (e.g., row1-2 col5=9 but col6=0 generated, likely needs fill); 1 in row3 col7 propagates poorly (only row3 col5-8=1s, but row12 col5=1 suggests vertical but not filled). Does not account for potential multi-specials or color-specific widths (e.g., 6 in row9 col15-17 needs wider prop than 1-col).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with numbers representing colors and 0s as empty cells) needs to be completed by propagating colors from top/bottom rows into middle rows based on structural patterns like vertical "spines" (consistent color columns), horizontal "special" positions in the top row (unique colors differing from neighbors), and grouping/processing rules to fill shapes or connections without overwriting existing cells or violating forbidden color rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns; top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows provide pattern templates that propagate downward into middle rows (1 to n-2), but only where cells are 0; existing non-zero cells must be respected.
 * Identify a "spine" as a column j where middle rows have the most consistent non-zero color (all same and non-zero); use the next column (j+1) as a "row_color_col" for vertical propagation to the right edge (column m-1).
 * "Forbidden" colors are those appearing in top/bottom rows from the spine onward; clear them from middle rows left of the spine to avoid conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color is non-zero and differs from both immediate neighbors (j-1 and j+1); these trigger horizontal or vertical fillings.
 * Group consecutive specials into clusters; single specials or non-pairs fill horizontally around them in qualifying middle rows (rows with matching color at row_color_col, and row index <= max special column), but skip centers conditionally (e.g., if top row has <2 of that color and not at grid center).
 * For pairs of consecutive specials (glen==2), apply special filling: propagate downward with gaps, fill adjacent cells (e.g., +1 column), and handle vertical extensions above/below if zero.
 * Subtleties: Fillings must check bounds (1 <= row <= n-2, etc.); for pairs, ensure exactly one qualifying row per color with specific spacing (e.g., h2 == h1 + 2); near-end specials (j+1 == m-2) avoid certain extensions; center filling (j == m//2) is forced; pairs override some skips.
 * Collect row-color mappings (r_cs) from middle rows at row_color_col for qualifying homes; only fill if exact match in count and position.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation to right edge only if middle row color at row_color_col is non-zero; clear left-side forbidden colors only if they match top/bottom from spine rightward; for non-pairs, horizontal fill range is l = max(row_color_col+1, j-1) to r = min(m-2, j+1), but skip center if conditions met and it was zero, then potentially fill vertically in adjacent rows.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes shape completion (e.g., blobs, lines) without expansion beyond patterns, respecting vertical consistency and horizontal uniqueness.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * process_group: Overly complex and buggy; mishandles pair vs. non-pair logic, leading to overfilling (e.g., extra verticals or horizontals); the skipped_center vertical fill ignores bounds properly but applies too broadly; color_specials defaultdict groups by top color but doesn't validate against expected shapes.
 * The pair-specific logic in main program (after process_group for glen==2): Attempts gap filling (h1+1) and lower extensions (h2+1 with jj range), but conditions like qual_h2[0] == qual_h1[0] + 2 are too rigid and fail when rows aren't exactly spaced; also fills j1+3 which may exceed patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of spine detection, forbidden clearing, and special grouping, but fails on precise filling rules, leading to overfills, underfills, or misplaced colors in all training cases.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly places a 4 at row0 col1 (should be 0, as top row patterns shouldn't propagate left/upward); also minor overfill in row4 col4 (3 instead of 4? but grids match closely otherwise); underfills or skips some vertical extensions in rows 5-7 for color 4/7 blobs; the spine (likely col3=2) propagates correctly to right edge, but specials (e.g., around col5=3, col9=4, col10=7) trigger wrong horizontal ranges, missing expected 0s in some centers.
 * Train 1 mismatches top row integrity for unknown reason (extra 4 at start, possibly from unhandled propagation); bottom row also has extra 4 at col1, symmetric error; process_group fills too many horizontals in non-pair groups, but pair handling (if any) is absent here.
 * Train 2: Generated overfills top/bottom rows with 5 at col1 (expected 0s); underfills row1/8 with 4s instead of patterned 7s at col7/11; row5 has 5s but expected more sparse 5s with 0s; row6 underfills 5s; specials (e.g., col9=5, col11=7) group poorly, leading to missing vertical 7s in rows 1/3/7/9 and horizontal 7s in row1 col7; pair logic (cols 7-8=7s? but top has 4,7,4) fails spacing check, so no gap fills.
 * Train 2 has broken forbidden clearing (allows 5s left of spine); extract-like r_cs works for color 3/4 but not 5/7/8; process_group skips centers incorrectly, filling extras like row2 col14=0 to 7 (expected 0).
 * Train 3: Generated overfills row2 col7=0 to 3 (expected 0, but row3 has 3s); underfills row5 col7=0 (expected 3? no, expected has 3 only in row3); row6 has 6 at col4 but expected vertical 6s sparse; row7 underfills col11=0 to 6 (expected 6); row8 overfills left with 7s at col0-2 (expected full 7s but pattern is horizontal bar); specials (col7=3, col11=6) not filling downward correctly for color 3 in row5.
 * Train 3 mismatches blob shapes for 3/6 (unknown reason, possibly wrong l/r ranges in process_group); pair handling absent, but no pairs here; find_spine likely picks col3=1 correctly, but propagation misses vertical skips.
 * Across attempts: Spine and r_cs collection work well (consistent verticals for main color like 3); grouping specials catches uniques but processing overfills horizontals (e.g., filling beyond j-1 to j+1); pair code is untriggered or buggy (no exact h1/h2 spacing); forbidden set clears left side partially but misses top/bottom symmetries.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overpropagates color 9 vertically in many middle rows (e.g., rows 1-2,5-6,11-12 all have 9 at col5, but expected likely sparser based on top pattern [...,9,9,1,9,...] suggesting 1 as a special interrupt); underfills horizontals for color 1 in row3 (fills 1s at col5-8, but col9+ should be 0 unless grouped); row6 has 3s at col5-9 but top has no 3 special there (top col5=3? wait, top row0 col4=3, but specials start after spine); row13 has 1 at col5 but vertical from top col7=1? inconsistent.
 * Missing vertical extensions for 4/6 in rows 7-8/9-10 (only partial, expected full blobs like in train2); overfills row14 bottom with 9s everywhere rightward, ignoring specials like col6=8, col16=6; spine likely col4=3, row_color_col=5, but propagation to col19=9 everywhere ignores forbidden (top has 1,4,6,8); no pair handling visible (e.g., cols16-17=6,9? not filled as pair); overall, looks like aggressive 9-filling from top patterns without respecting uniqueness or gaps, making shapes blob into unintended merges (e.g., 9s connecting across 1/3 barriers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by prioritizing maximum uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with a fallback for any uniform column; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by numbers, with 0 as empty) where the goal is to fill in empty cells (zeros) based on propagation rules from a central "spine" column in the middle rows, while respecting forbidden colors from the top and bottom borders, and specially handling isolated or grouped unique colors in the top row to extend them downward and sideways into empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The spine is a column (often around the middle) that must have the most uniform non-zero color across middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in the top or bottom row to the right of the spine; these must be cleared (set to 0) from all positions left of the spine across the entire grid to prevent invalid propagation.
 * After identifying the spine, propagate its color (from row_color_col = spine + 1) to the rightmost column in all middle rows where it's non-zero.
 * Special "potential" columns are isolated top-row colors (non-zero, different from left and right neighbors) to the right of row_color_col; group consecutive ones and handle singles (fill adjacent empties in qualifying middle rows) or pairs (similar but extended vertically) differently, with skips for center positions if isolated and post-half grid.
 * Qualifying rows for propagation are middle rows (1 to n-2) that have the color in row_color_col, but only those <= the special column index for horizontal fills.
 * Horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of the special column (or from row_color_col+1), vertical fills go up/down 1 row from qualifying rows but only into empties, and for pairs, vertical also fills horizontal neighbors in those offset rows.
 * Subtle: For singles post-half grid with count 1, skip filling the center (k==j) to avoid overfill; for groups >2, treat as singles without skip. Ensure no overwriting of non-zeros.
 * Grid edges (rows 0 and n-1, columns 0 and m-1) are borders and not filled in middle propagation; n<3 grids unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only into zeros, not overwriting; r_cs tracks middle rows per color in row_color_col for qualifiers; isol_count tracks how many potentials per color to filter true isolates (those matching total top-right count).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine column by maximizing uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with fallback; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This groups consecutive isolated top-row positions, essential for distinguishing single/pair/multi handling.)

```python
def handle_single(g: List[List[int]], j: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter, skip_center: bool = True):
    c = g[0][j]
    qual = [i for i in r_cs.get(c, []) if i <= j]
    do_skip = skip_center and (j > half) and (count_c[c] == 1)
    l = max(row_color_col + 1, j - 1)
    r = min(m - 2, j + 1)
    for i in qual:
        for k in range(l, r + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0 and not (do_skip and k == j):
                g[i][k] = c
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1 and g[ii][j] == 0:
                g[ii][j] = c
```
(This handles single isolated top colors by filling horizontal/vertical empties in qualifying rows; skip_center prevents overfill in late isolates. Helpful for core filling logic.)

```python
def handle_pair(g: List[List[int]], j1: int, j2: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter):
    c1 = g[0][j1]
    c2 = g[0][j2]
    qual1 = [i for i in r_cs.get(c1, []) if i <= j1]
    l1 = max(row_color_col + 1, j1 - 1)
    r1 = min(m - 2, j1 + 1)
    for i in qual1:
        for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0:
                g[i][k] = c1
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1:
                for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
                    if g[ii][k] == 0:
                        g[ii][k] = c1
    # Similar block for c2, qual2, l2, r2 (omitted for brevity)
```
(This extends single logic to pairs, adding horizontal fill in vertical offsets; useful for grouped cases but note the incomplete vertical check in the provided code snippet—may need fix for g[ii][j2]==0.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly solved all three training examples, indicating strong handling of spine detection, forbidden color clearing, and basic propagation for standard cases.
 * Worked well: Uniform spine finding, grouping consecutives, filtering true isolates via count matching, and limited fills without overwriting.
 * Did not work fully: In the test output, propagation seems incomplete—e.g., row 3 has a run of 1's filled horizontally but no vertical extension below; row 6 has 3's in middle but zeros persist around them without full flood; forbidden clearing left some potential invalid colors (unknown if input had them).
 * Potential overfill or skip issues: do_skip in handle_single prevented center fills post-half, but in test, some late areas (e.g., columns 14-18 with 4,6,9) have partial fills missing adjacent zeros.
 * r_cs qualification (i <= j) may be too restrictive for test, as some middle rows >j have matching colors but aren't used, leaving empties (e.g., lower 9's not propagating up).
 * handle_pair has a bug: vertical dr loop lacks g[ii][j]==0 check (fills unconditionally if in bounds), and the provided code snippet cuts off qual2 handling—likely causes overfill or asymmetry in pairs.
 * Overall, the program understands core structure (spine, isolates, propagation) but misses nuances in vertical extension for pairs and qualifier filtering, leading to underfill in complex test grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., column 4 all 3's propagated from spine; top row isolates like 1 at col7 filled down to row3; 4's and 6's in cols14-17 partially extended horizontally/vertically), which makes sense for basic rules but looks incomplete and incorrect overall.
 * Observed: Many zeros remain in middle/right areas (e.g., rows 2-5, cols6-13 mostly zero except sparse 1's and 9's; row10 has 6's but no fill left/right beyond; bottom rows 12-14 have minimal changes, missing expected propagation from top 9's or 1's).
 * Differences from expected: Expected fuller fills based on patterns (e.g., the 1 in row2 col7 should propagate more vertically/horizontally via qualifiers, but stops abruptly; 8 in row14 col6 and 3's in row14 cols10-11 suggest unpaired fills missing; top-right 9's dominate but don't flood lower empties as in training). It underfills compared to likely complete solution, possibly due to strict i<=j in qualifiers or pair handling bug—e.g., no clear pair grouping visible in output.
 * Does not look fully correct: Leaves isolated zeros in propagate-able areas (e.g., around row7 col19=3, should extend left), and some fills like row3 cols5-9=3,1,1,1,1 seem arbitrary/not matching color source; unknown why bottom row14 mirrors top but with extras like 8,1,9's not cleared if forbidden.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:27:03] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in missing cells (0s) with colors from a palette, guided by patterns on the borders (top and bottom rows) and consistency rules in the middle rows, such as propagating colors along a central "spine" column and handling isolated or grouped color segments to complete symmetric or matching internal structures. The puzzle emphasizes symmetry, color matching across rows, and avoiding forbidden colors while respecting border-defined "special" positions that trigger inward filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns, with top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) borders providing color clues; middle rows (1 to n-2) start partially filled and need propagation without altering borders.
 * Identify a "spine" as the leftmost column j where middle rows have the maximum number of identical non-zero colors (or all matching if no partial matches); if none, default to no changes.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in borders from the spine column rightward; clear left-of-spine cells in all rows if they match forbidden colors.
 * Copy spine-adjacent colors (row_color_col = min(spine+1, m-1)) to the rightmost column (m-1) in middle rows for endpoint consistency.
 * Propagation from borders: Detect "specials" as positions j > row_color_col where border cell differs from both neighbors (isolated or edged colors); group consecutive specials into clusters.
 * For groups of length 2: Propagate each color vertically to qualified middle rows (based on position constraints like min_i/max_i relative to j) and horizontally to adjacent empty cells, with skips for right-half singles; also fill neighboring rows' same or adjacent columns.
 * For groups >2 or singles: Handle local subsets where color count in group matches border count right of row_color_col; extend fill ranges for end positions; special cases for small singles (glen==1) limit fills to center or left-adjacent in upper/lower rows, avoiding overfill in right half; only propagate if specials exist beyond m//2 for bottom border.
 * Subtle: Directionality (is_top=True for top border uses upward constraints, False for bottom uses downward); avoid filling if count_c[c] ==1 and j > half+1 to prevent overpropagation; r_cs tracks rows per color at row_color_col for qualification.
 * Easy to miss: All fills only to 0 cells; no changes if no spine; border_row param in find_specials allows bottom propagation; qual lists filter rows by positional bounds (e.g., for top: ii <= j, for bottom: n-1-j <= ii).
 * General: Grids may have varying widths (m=14-20); colors are integers 1+; symmetry often mirrored top-bottom; unfilled areas remain 0.
 * Considerations across attempts: Propagation can overfill (e.g., placing colors where expected 0) or underfill (missing chains); group handling fails on non-consecutive specials; spine detection may pick wrong column if partial matches tie.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds column with max consistent non-zero color in middle rows; fallback to first all-matching non-zero.
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int, border: int = 0) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts positions in border row where color !=0 and differs from left/right neighbors (edge detections).
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[border][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[border][j - 1] and c != grid[border][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Groups consecutive special positions into clusters for batched propagation.
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in propagation logic, especially for group handling and positional constraints.
 * Train 1: Overfilled row 8 col5 with 6 (generated [...,3,6,0,...] vs expected [...,3,0,0,...]); underfilled row 9 cols5-17 with 6 chain missing (generated partial 6s vs expected single 6 at col5 and col17); row 6 has 7 at col5 but expected 0 there? Wait, no—row 6 generated [0,0,0,2,7,0,...] matches expected, but overall mismatches in 6 and 7 blobs suggest wrong qual filtering or skip logic.
 * Train 2: Underfilled row 2 cols9-12 with 7s missing one (generated [...,7,0,7,7,0,7] vs expected [...,0,7,7,7,0,7]? Wait, expected has 7 at col9); overfilled row 6 col9 with 5 (generated [...,5,0,7,...] vs expected [...,0,7,...]—unknown why, possibly erroneous single-group fill); row 8 matches top but bottom propagation failed symmetrically.
 * Train 3: Underfilled row 2 col6 with 0 (generated [...,2,0,3,0,...] vs expected [...,2,0,0,3,...]—shifted 3 placement); row 6 has 6 at col13 missing (generated [...,0,0,0,6,0,2] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6]); row 6 col4=6 matches but chain incomplete; suggests issues in left-end/right-end extensions for glen>2 and single fills in right half.
 * Spine detection worked in all (e.g., col3=1 or 2 consistent), forbidden clearing partial (left cols zeroed correctly), but propagation over/underfills due to qual bounds (e.g., min_i/max_i too restrictive) or do_skip misapplied.
 * find_specials and group_specials are helpful for border analysis but may miss non-consecutive edges if neighbors match indirectly; r_cs defaultdict for color-row mapping is essential for targeted fills.
 * The main program(g) structure is solid (copy grid, apply spine/forbidden, then propagate top/bottom), but propagate_from_border is overly complex and buggy in group cases (e.g., local_js subsetting ignores some colors; upper/lower fills inconsistent for small singles).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem puzzle-relevant, though the all-matching fallback in find_spine may be too greedy (picks first, not max).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially matches expected patterns but appears incorrect overall, as it underfills several areas: e.g., row 6 has 3-chain at cols9-11 but expected likely extends to col4 or mirrors top 1-chain; row 7 has 4-chain at cols13-15 but misses potential left extension or 0s; row 9 has isolated 6s but no connecting fills, suggesting incomplete single-group propagation.
 * Overfills evident in row 12 col1=7 (possibly forbidden leak) and row 14 cols16-19 with 9s where borders suggest sparsity; rightmost col19 consistently 9 or matching, which seems correct, but middle row12 has 1-chain at cols5-8 matching top but bottom row13/14 have mismatched 8/9 intrusions.
 * Does not look fully correct—lacks symmetry (e.g., top row2 col6=1 not mirrored in bottom equivalents); 4 and 6 in lower middle (rows7-10) seem truncated vs border clues (row0 has 4 at col14,6 at col15); likely misses key considerations like half=m//2=10 skips for right-half specials, leading to sparse right side.
 * To handle test: Ensure qual for bottom uses correct n-1-j bounds; extend r for left_ends properly; account for larger m=20 with more groups.

[2025-10-01 02:27:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds column j in middle_rows with most uniform non-zero color (max_count of same color), or first uniform non-zero if none.
    # Helpful for identifying central propagation anchor, but may need refinement for ties or partial uniformity.
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated colors in top row (differs from left/right neighbors) after row_color_col, up to m-2.
    # Useful for detecting seed points to fill middle rows, but limited to post-spine and may miss left or end cases.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-filling puzzle where colors from the top and bottom rows propagate into the middle rows based on patterns, likely forming "objects" or "blobs" guided by a central "spine" column of consistent color, with rules for filling adjacent cells, avoiding forbidden colors, and handling special transition points in the top row. The goal is to complete the grid by filling zeros with appropriate colors while preserving existing non-zero cells and ensuring symmetry or pattern matching across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) that has the most consistent non-zero color; if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column—subtlety: this spine guides propagation to the rightmost column but only if it's not at the edge.
 * Propagate the color from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) to the last column (m-1) in middle rows, but only for non-zero values.
 * Clear "forbidden" colors in left-side columns (0 to spine-1) of middle rows if those colors appear non-zero in the top or bottom rows from spine to end—this prevents overlap or invalid extensions, but it's easy to miss that forbidden is a set of colors from borders only in right half.
 * Group "specials": these are columns in the top row (from row_color_col+1 to m-2) where the color changes from neighbors (c != left and c != right), indicating starts/ends of patterns; subtlety: group consecutive specials into clusters, and handle singles vs. groups differently (e.g., singles may skip centers under conditions, groups of 2 get extra 3-wide fills in adjacent rows).
 * For filling: Use "homes" (middle rows with the special's color in row_color_col) to fill 3-wide horizontal strips (left=max(row_color_col, j-1) to right=min(m-2, j+1)) in those rows and vertically in adjacent rows (±1), but only zeros and avoiding skips for certain cases; for groups >1, treat as expanded fills without center skips, and for glen=2 add extra 3-wide in adj rows for the second.
 * Subtlety: Half-point (m//2) influences skipping centers for single specials if the color appears only once right of center; also, homes are filtered by row index <= special column j, suggesting left-to-right propagation bias.
 * Border rows (0 and n-1) should remain mostly unchanged except possibly clearing or matching, but code doesn't alter them much—easy to miss that top/bottom guide but aren't filled into.
 * Edge cases: Grids <3 rows return unchanged; no spine or invalid spine returns copy; non-consecutive specials form separate groups; all-zero columns in specials ignored.
 * General: Preserve all existing non-zeros; fills only to zeros; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; patterns seem to form vertical/horizontal extensions of top-row blobs into middle, like a "shadow" or "support" structure.

(This function is helpful for identifying the guiding spine column based on consistency in middle rows.)

```python
def find_specials(grid_out: List[List[int]], rcc: int, mm: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(rcc + 1, mm - 1):
        c = grid_out[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid_out[0][j - 1] and c != grid_out[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special

def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(These are useful for detecting and clustering transition points in the top row, essential for targeted filling.)

```python
r_cs = defaultdict(list)
for i in middle_rows:
    c = g_out[i][row_color_col]
    if c != 0:
        r_cs[c].append(i)
```
(This defaultdict collects "homes" per color from the row_color_col, key for selecting rows to fill.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the spine in all training examples (e.g., likely column 4 with color 3 in Train 1), propagates to the last column accurately (e.g., ends with 3/4/7/6 as expected), and clears some forbidden left-side cells (e.g., zeros out many left positions in middle rows).
 * What worked: Grouping specials correctly detects transitions (e.g., in Train 1, specials around columns for 6,4,7,6 changes); basic 3-wide fills for singles and groups partially match, like filling 4/7 blobs in rows 4-7 of Train 1; vertical propagation to adj rows works in places (e.g., row 6 in Train 1 gets 7s).
 * What didn't work: Over-fills or incorrect fills in unexpected places, e.g., in Train 1, top row (row 0) position 1 filled with 4 (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]), and row 11 position 1 also 4 vs 0—suggests unintended border modification or propagation leak; in row 4 of Train 1, position 8 has 4 but expected 0? Wait, actually rows 0-11 generated vs expected show minor diffs like row 4 pos 4:4 vs 4 (match), but overall mismatches in left fills.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 4s in top/bottom left (pos 1), and row 5 pos 17:3 vs expected 3 (match?), but row 9 pos 4:6 vs 6 (match)—diffs mainly in borders and some middle left (e.g., row 3 pos 9:4 vs 0? No, row 3: [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] vs expected same, wait—actually close but says INCORRECT, likely subtle like row 4 pos 8:4 vs 0? Upon close check, generated row 4 has pos 8:4 but expected pos 8:0 in some? No, expected row 4: [0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]—yes, pos 8:4 matches, but perhaps row 0/11 extras are the issue; unknown why borders got filled.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated fills too many 4s/7s in middle, e.g., row 1 pos 9-11:4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0; row 2 pos 10:4 vs 7; row 4 pos 7-12:0,4,4,4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0,5,0,0; row 5 pos 5:5 vs 5 (match), but row 6 pos 9:5 vs 5 (match)—over-filling groups without proper skipping or home filtering; also top row pos 1:5 vs 0.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated top row pos 1:3 vs 0; row 1 pos 7:0 vs 0 (match), but row 2 pos 7:3 vs 3 (match?); row 6 pos 13:6 vs 6 (match), but row 8 pos 0-2:7,7,7 vs 7,7,7 (match)—diffs in left fills like row 0 pos 1:3 vs 0, and some middle like row 3 pos 4:3 vs 3 (match), but row 6 pos 4:6 vs 6; seems extra border fills and incomplete clears (e.g., row 9 pos 1-3:0,0,0 vs 0,0,0).
 * Overall: The filling logic for groups (esp. glen=2 with extra adj fills) over-extends horizontally/vertically, ignoring some zero preservations; skip_center logic doesn't trigger properly (e.g., in Train 1 single 6 at pos 6?); home filtering (ii <= j) may be too restrictive or not applied consistently; no extraction of full "objects" or blobs, so misses holistic shape matching—consider adding a function to validate blob connectivity post-fill.
 * Function find_spine is helpful and seems accurate; find_specials and group_specials are useful but may mis-detect if top row has zeros or plateaus; r_cs is essential for per-color homes but could be enhanced to check vertical consistency; the glen>=3 handling as "non-skipping singles" works partially but leads to fragmented fills; no unhelpful functions, but the complex if-else for groups is brittle—easy to miss that for glen=2, first special gets standard fill but second gets extra adj 3-wide, which overfills in Train 2.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits issues from the training failures: e.g., top row (row 0) has pos 1:1 vs likely expected 0 (similar to Train 1/2/3 border overfills); row 12 pos 1:7 vs probably 0; row 14 has many 9s in right but left pos 6-19 overfilled with 9s where patterns like 1-blob or 3/4/6 should be sparser.
 * Middle rows show partial propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3s around pos 5-11, matching a potential 3-blob; row 7-9 have 4s in pos 13-16, good for a 4-group), but overfills like row 3 pos 6-9:1,1,1,1 vs likely narrower (expected might zero some based on top 1 at pos 7); row 10 pos 14-16:6,6,6 good, but row 5 pos 10:3 vs possibly 0 if not a home.
 * Right column (pos 19) consistently filled with 9/1/3/4/6/9 as per propagation, which makes sense if spine is col 4 (3s), but left clears are incomplete (e.g., row 2 pos 7:1 but if 1 forbidden from top, should be 0); vertical fills in adj rows seem spotty, e.g., row 7 pos 5:4 but row 6/8 pos 5:3/0 mismatch.
 * Overall, it partially forms blobs (e.g., 9s in rows 1-2,5,11-14 right-side), but extras like row 14 pos 6:8 (from top?) and missing sparsity in 1/3 areas suggest wrong special grouping or skip logic—does not match expected holistic patterns, likely needs better forbidden application and group handling to avoid dense overfills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero cells (empty spaces) with appropriate color numbers based on patterns, symmetries, and propagation rules across rows and columns, likely simulating object placement or contour filling in a 2D scene with top/bottom borders and middle "body" rows that extend or match colors from a central "spine" structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that act as fixed borders or outlines, while middle rows (1 to n-2) are where most filling/propagation occurs, often mirroring or extending patterns from these borders without overwriting non-zero cells.
 * Identify a "spine" column (or near it) in middle rows where a single consistent non-zero color dominates vertically; this serves as an anchor for horizontal propagation to the right (e.g., filling the last column with the spine's color) and vertical influences.
 * "Forbidden" colors are collected from top/bottom rows to the right of the spine and used to clear conflicting colors to the left of the spine in middle rows, ensuring no bleed-over from border patterns.
 * "Special" columns are isolated non-zero cells in the top row that differ from immediate neighbors (e.g., peaks or isolated features); these trigger targeted filling in middle rows for matching colors, often limited to homes (rows) associated with that color and propagating horizontally within bounds (e.g., j-1 to j+1, but adjusted near edges) and vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Color "homes" are middle rows grouped by their color in a key column (spine+1), and filling for specials is restricted to homes "below" or at the special's position (e.g., ii <= j), suggesting a downward or positional hierarchy.
 * Propagation is conservative: only fill zeros, avoid overwriting existing non-zeros, and respect grid edges (e.g., no filling beyond m-2 or before spine+1 in some cases); vertical propagation is limited to immediate adjacent rows (dr = -1,1) and only if target is zero.
 * Subtleties: Spine detection prioritizes columns with the most consistent non-zero color in middle rows, falling back to any uniform non-zero; specials skip edge cases (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2). Filling for specials may need to extend further right/left in some cases (e.g., for wider objects like the 7s in train1 row5/6/7). Edge handling is critical near m-3 or later, where left bounds shift rightward. No filling if n<3. Patterns suggest symmetry or object completion (e.g., filling blobs like 7s horizontally across multiple columns if aligned).
 * Across attempts, over-filling or under-filling occurs: e.g., missing horizontal extensions for colors like 7 in train1 (row5 col11=7 expected but 0 generated), incorrect vertical fills (train3 row6 col12=0 expected but 6 generated), or misplaced propagations (train2 row4 col7=0 expected but 4 generated). Test grid shows complex interactions with multiple colors (3,9,1,4,6,7,8) and potential multi-spine or irregular objects.

    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies spines in simple cases (e.g., col4 with color 3 in train1/2/3 middles) and propagates last-column fills accurately (e.g., all 3s in train1 middles col17).
 * What worked: Clearing forbidden colors left of spine (e.g., train1 row1-11 col0-3 cleared to 0 where conflicting); basic home grouping by color in row_color_col (spine+1); vertical propagation for specials in adjacent rows if zero (e.g., train3 row7 col11=6 from row6).
 * What didn't work: Under-fills horizontal extensions for specials (train1 row5 col12=0 generated but 7 expected; train1 row7 col9-11=7,7,7 expected but partial/missing); over-fills or misplaces in specials (train2 row4 col7=4 generated but 0 expected; train2 row2 col10=4 generated but 7 expected); incorrect spine fallback or special bounds (train3 row6 col12=6 generated but 0 expected, possibly from over-propagation of 6 homes).
 * Train1: Generated misses 7s in row5 col12, row7 col9-10 (under-fill blob); row3 col17=3 correct but row4 col17=4 expected (wrong last-col prop for color4 row); row8 col9=0 generated but 7 expected (missed vertical from row7).
 * Train2: Generated over-fills row1 col9-10=4,4 but expected 0,0; row2 col10=4 but 7 expected (wrong color prop); row4 col7=4 but 0 expected; row5 col9=4 but 5 expected (misplaced 5); row6 col13-14=0,0 but expected 0,0 correct, but overall pattern mismatches border extensions.
 * Train3: Generated row6 col12=6 but 0 expected (over-fill right of 6); row6 col10=0 but 6 expected (under-fill 6 blob); row7 col12=6 but 0 expected (vertical over-prop).
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; current program lacks blob detection (e.g., connected components for colors like 7s or 4s) which could help complete shapes.
 * Function `program` overall is a good skeleton (copies grid, handles n<3) but broken in special filling bounds/logic (e.g., l/r ranges too narrow, ignores wider objects); find_spine helpful but may pick wrong col if ties; find_specials useful but misses if specials in bottom row or non-top.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., consistent 3s in col4 middles as potential spine, last-col fills like 9s/3s/4s/6s match row colors in col5; some clearings left of col4 to 0s; vertical fills like row7 col19=3 from row6) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Issues: Under-fills apparent blobs, e.g., row6 col5=3, col9=3, col10=3, col11=3 but col12=0 (likely needs horizontal extension to match expected 3 blob from border); row7 col14-16=4,4,4 correct but row8 col14-16=4,4,4 overwrites? Wait, generated has them as 4s but if forbidden, should clear—unclear without rules, but pattern suggests row8 col10=0 should fill to 3? from row7 col10=3.
 * Over-fills or misses: row3 col5-9=1,1,1,1,0 but top has 1 at col7, suggests special at col7=1, but generated row3 col9=0 (under-fill right); row12 col1=7 but top/middle suggest 7s in left cols, possibly forbidden clear missed; row13 col19=9 correct but row11 col19=9 from prop, yet row10 col17=0 but expected 6 extension from row9 col15-17=4,6,6? (wait, color mismatch).
 * Test has irregular features (e.g., 8s in row13-14 col2-3, 7s in row12 col1/3, multiple 9 blobs in top/bottom), so output misses completing 9s in middles (e.g., row1-2 col5=9 but col6=0 generated, likely needs fill); 1 in row3 col7 propagates poorly (only row3 col5-8=1s, but row12 col5=1 suggests vertical but not filled). Does not account for potential multi-specials or color-specific widths (e.g., 6 in row9 col15-17 needs wider prop than 1-col).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with numbers representing colors and 0s as empty cells) needs to be completed by propagating colors from top/bottom rows into middle rows based on structural patterns like vertical "spines" (consistent color columns), horizontal "special" positions in the top row (unique colors differing from neighbors), and grouping/processing rules to fill shapes or connections without overwriting existing cells or violating forbidden color rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns; top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows provide pattern templates that propagate downward into middle rows (1 to n-2), but only where cells are 0; existing non-zero cells must be respected.
 * Identify a "spine" as a column j where middle rows have the most consistent non-zero color (all same and non-zero); use the next column (j+1) as a "row_color_col" for vertical propagation to the right edge (column m-1).
 * "Forbidden" colors are those appearing in top/bottom rows from the spine onward; clear them from middle rows left of the spine to avoid conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color is non-zero and differs from both immediate neighbors (j-1 and j+1); these trigger horizontal or vertical fillings.
 * Group consecutive specials into clusters; single specials or non-pairs fill horizontally around them in qualifying middle rows (rows with matching color at row_color_col, and row index <= max special column), but skip centers conditionally (e.g., if top row has <2 of that color and not at grid center).
 * For pairs of consecutive specials (glen==2), apply special filling: propagate downward with gaps, fill adjacent cells (e.g., +1 column), and handle vertical extensions above/below if zero.
 * Subtleties: Fillings must check bounds (1 <= row <= n-2, etc.); for pairs, ensure exactly one qualifying row per color with specific spacing (e.g., h2 == h1 + 2); near-end specials (j+1 == m-2) avoid certain extensions; center filling (j == m//2) is forced; pairs override some skips.
 * Collect row-color mappings (r_cs) from middle rows at row_color_col for qualifying homes; only fill if exact match in count and position.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation to right edge only if middle row color at row_color_col is non-zero; clear left-side forbidden colors only if they match top/bottom from spine rightward; for non-pairs, horizontal fill range is l = max(row_color_col+1, j-1) to r = min(m-2, j+1), but skip center if conditions met and it was zero, then potentially fill vertically in adjacent rows.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes shape completion (e.g., blobs, lines) without expansion beyond patterns, respecting vertical consistency and horizontal uniqueness.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * process_group: Overly complex and buggy; mishandles pair vs. non-pair logic, leading to overfilling (e.g., extra verticals or horizontals); the skipped_center vertical fill ignores bounds properly but applies too broadly; color_specials defaultdict groups by top color but doesn't validate against expected shapes.
 * The pair-specific logic in main program (after process_group for glen==2): Attempts gap filling (h1+1) and lower extensions (h2+1 with jj range), but conditions like qual_h2[0] == qual_h1[0] + 2 are too rigid and fail when rows aren't exactly spaced; also fills j1+3 which may exceed patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of spine detection, forbidden clearing, and special grouping, but fails on precise filling rules, leading to overfills, underfills, or misplaced colors in all training cases.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly places a 4 at row0 col1 (should be 0, as top row patterns shouldn't propagate left/upward); also minor overfill in row4 col4 (3 instead of 4? but grids match closely otherwise); underfills or skips some vertical extensions in rows 5-7 for color 4/7 blobs; the spine (likely col3=2) propagates correctly to right edge, but specials (e.g., around col5=3, col9=4, col10=7) trigger wrong horizontal ranges, missing expected 0s in some centers.
 * Train 1 mismatches top row integrity for unknown reason (extra 4 at start, possibly from unhandled propagation); bottom row also has extra 4 at col1, symmetric error; process_group fills too many horizontals in non-pair groups, but pair handling (if any) is absent here.
 * Train 2: Generated overfills top/bottom rows with 5 at col1 (expected 0s); underfills row1/8 with 4s instead of patterned 7s at col7/11; row5 has 5s but expected more sparse 5s with 0s; row6 underfills 5s; specials (e.g., col9=5, col11=7) group poorly, leading to missing vertical 7s in rows 1/3/7/9 and horizontal 7s in row1 col7; pair logic (cols 7-8=7s? but top has 4,7,4) fails spacing check, so no gap fills.
 * Train 2 has broken forbidden clearing (allows 5s left of spine); extract-like r_cs works for color 3/4 but not 5/7/8; process_group skips centers incorrectly, filling extras like row2 col14=0 to 7 (expected 0).
 * Train 3: Generated overfills row2 col7=0 to 3 (expected 0, but row3 has 3s); underfills row5 col7=0 (expected 3? no, expected has 3 only in row3); row6 has 6 at col4 but expected vertical 6s sparse; row7 underfills col11=0 to 6 (expected 6); row8 overfills left with 7s at col0-2 (expected full 7s but pattern is horizontal bar); specials (col7=3, col11=6) not filling downward correctly for color 3 in row5.
 * Train 3 mismatches blob shapes for 3/6 (unknown reason, possibly wrong l/r ranges in process_group); pair handling absent, but no pairs here; find_spine likely picks col3=1 correctly, but propagation misses vertical skips.
 * Across attempts: Spine and r_cs collection work well (consistent verticals for main color like 3); grouping specials catches uniques but processing overfills horizontals (e.g., filling beyond j-1 to j+1); pair code is untriggered or buggy (no exact h1/h2 spacing); forbidden set clears left side partially but misses top/bottom symmetries.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overpropagates color 9 vertically in many middle rows (e.g., rows 1-2,5-6,11-12 all have 9 at col5, but expected likely sparser based on top pattern [...,9,9,1,9,...] suggesting 1 as a special interrupt); underfills horizontals for color 1 in row3 (fills 1s at col5-8, but col9+ should be 0 unless grouped); row6 has 3s at col5-9 but top has no 3 special there (top col5=3? wait, top row0 col4=3, but specials start after spine); row13 has 1 at col5 but vertical from top col7=1? inconsistent.
 * Missing vertical extensions for 4/6 in rows 7-8/9-10 (only partial, expected full blobs like in train2); overfills row14 bottom with 9s everywhere rightward, ignoring specials like col6=8, col16=6; spine likely col4=3, row_color_col=5, but propagation to col19=9 everywhere ignores forbidden (top has 1,4,6,8); no pair handling visible (e.g., cols16-17=6,9? not filled as pair); overall, looks like aggressive 9-filling from top patterns without respecting uniqueness or gaps, making shapes blob into unintended merges (e.g., 9s connecting across 1/3 barriers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in missing cells (0s) with colors from a palette, guided by patterns on the borders (top and bottom rows) and consistency rules in the middle rows, such as propagating colors along a central "spine" column and handling isolated or grouped color segments to complete symmetric or matching internal structures. The puzzle emphasizes symmetry, color matching across rows, and avoiding forbidden colors while respecting border-defined "special" positions that trigger inward filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns, with top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) borders providing color clues; middle rows (1 to n-2) start partially filled and need propagation without altering borders.
 * Identify a "spine" as the leftmost column j where middle rows have the maximum number of identical non-zero colors (or all matching if no partial matches); if none, default to no changes.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in borders from the spine column rightward; clear left-of-spine cells in all rows if they match forbidden colors.
 * Copy spine-adjacent colors (row_color_col = min(spine+1, m-1)) to the rightmost column (m-1) in middle rows for endpoint consistency.
 * Propagation from borders: Detect "specials" as positions j > row_color_col where border cell differs from both neighbors (isolated or edged colors); group consecutive specials into clusters.
 * For groups of length 2: Propagate each color vertically to qualified middle rows (based on position constraints like min_i/max_i relative to j) and horizontally to adjacent empty cells, with skips for right-half singles; also fill neighboring rows' same or adjacent columns.
 * For groups >2 or singles: Handle local subsets where color count in group matches border count right of row_color_col; extend fill ranges for end positions; special cases for small singles (glen==1) limit fills to center or left-adjacent in upper/lower rows, avoiding overfill in right half; only propagate if specials exist beyond m//2 for bottom border.
 * Subtle: Directionality (is_top=True for top border uses upward constraints, False for bottom uses downward); avoid filling if count_c[c] ==1 and j > half+1 to prevent overpropagation; r_cs tracks rows per color at row_color_col for qualification.
 * Easy to miss: All fills only to 0 cells; no changes if no spine; border_row param in find_specials allows bottom propagation; qual lists filter rows by positional bounds (e.g., for top: ii <= j, for bottom: n-1-j <= ii).
 * General: Grids may have varying widths (m=14-20); colors are integers 1+; symmetry often mirrored top-bottom; unfilled areas remain 0.
 * Considerations across attempts: Propagation can overfill (e.g., placing colors where expected 0) or underfill (missing chains); group handling fails on non-consecutive specials; spine detection may pick wrong column if partial matches tie.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in propagation logic, especially for group handling and positional constraints.
 * Train 1: Overfilled row 8 col5 with 6 (generated [...,3,6,0,...] vs expected [...,3,0,0,...]); underfilled row 9 cols5-17 with 6 chain missing (generated partial 6s vs expected single 6 at col5 and col17); row 6 has 7 at col5 but expected 0 there? Wait, no—row 6 generated [0,0,0,2,7,0,...] matches expected, but overall mismatches in 6 and 7 blobs suggest wrong qual filtering or skip logic.
 * Train 2: Underfilled row 2 cols9-12 with 7s missing one (generated [...,7,0,7,7,0,7] vs expected [...,0,7,7,7,0,7]? Wait, expected has 7 at col9); overfilled row 6 col9 with 5 (generated [...,5,0,7,...] vs expected [...,0,7,...]—unknown why, possibly erroneous single-group fill); row 8 matches top but bottom propagation failed symmetrically.
 * Train 3: Underfilled row 2 col6 with 0 (generated [...,2,0,3,0,...] vs expected [...,2,0,0,3,...]—shifted 3 placement); row 6 has 6 at col13 missing (generated [...,0,0,0,6,0,2] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6]); row 6 col4=6 matches but chain incomplete; suggests issues in left-end/right-end extensions for glen>2 and single fills in right half.
 * Spine detection worked in all (e.g., col3=1 or 2 consistent), forbidden clearing partial (left cols zeroed correctly), but propagation over/underfills due to qual bounds (e.g., min_i/max_i too restrictive) or do_skip misapplied.
 * find_specials and group_specials are helpful for border analysis but may miss non-consecutive edges if neighbors match indirectly; r_cs defaultdict for color-row mapping is essential for targeted fills.
 * The main program(g) structure is solid (copy grid, apply spine/forbidden, then propagate top/bottom), but propagate_from_border is overly complex and buggy in group cases (e.g., local_js subsetting ignores some colors; upper/lower fills inconsistent for small singles).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem puzzle-relevant, though the all-matching fallback in find_spine may be too greedy (picks first, not max).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially matches expected patterns but appears incorrect overall, as it underfills several areas: e.g., row 6 has 3-chain at cols9-11 but expected likely extends to col4 or mirrors top 1-chain; row 7 has 4-chain at cols13-15 but misses potential left extension or 0s; row 9 has isolated 6s but no connecting fills, suggesting incomplete single-group propagation.
 * Overfills evident in row 12 col1=7 (possibly forbidden leak) and row 14 cols16-19 with 9s where borders suggest sparsity; rightmost col19 consistently 9 or matching, which seems correct, but middle row12 has 1-chain at cols5-8 matching top but bottom row13/14 have mismatched 8/9 intrusions.
 * Does not look fully correct—lacks symmetry (e.g., top row2 col6=1 not mirrored in bottom equivalents); 4 and 6 in lower middle (rows7-10) seem truncated vs border clues (row0 has 4 at col14,6 at col15); likely misses key considerations like half=m//2=10 skips for right-half specials, leading to sparse right side.
 * To handle test: Ensure qual for bottom uses correct n-1-j bounds; extend r for left_ends properly; account for larger m=20 with more groups.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by prioritizing maximum uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with a fallback for any uniform column; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by numbers, with 0 as empty) where the goal is to fill in empty cells (zeros) based on propagation rules from a central "spine" column in the middle rows, while respecting forbidden colors from the top and bottom borders, and specially handling isolated or grouped unique colors in the top row to extend them downward and sideways into empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The spine is a column (often around the middle) that must have the most uniform non-zero color across middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in the top or bottom row to the right of the spine; these must be cleared (set to 0) from all positions left of the spine across the entire grid to prevent invalid propagation.
 * After identifying the spine, propagate its color (from row_color_col = spine + 1) to the rightmost column in all middle rows where it's non-zero.
 * Special "potential" columns are isolated top-row colors (non-zero, different from left and right neighbors) to the right of row_color_col; group consecutive ones and handle singles (fill adjacent empties in qualifying middle rows) or pairs (similar but extended vertically) differently, with skips for center positions if isolated and post-half grid.
 * Qualifying rows for propagation are middle rows (1 to n-2) that have the color in row_color_col, but only those <= the special column index for horizontal fills.
 * Horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of the special column (or from row_color_col+1), vertical fills go up/down 1 row from qualifying rows but only into empties, and for pairs, vertical also fills horizontal neighbors in those offset rows.
 * Subtle: For singles post-half grid with count 1, skip filling the center (k==j) to avoid overfill; for groups >2, treat as singles without skip. Ensure no overwriting of non-zeros.
 * Grid edges (rows 0 and n-1, columns 0 and m-1) are borders and not filled in middle propagation; n<3 grids unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only into zeros, not overwriting; r_cs tracks middle rows per color in row_color_col for qualifiers; isol_count tracks how many potentials per color to filter true isolates (those matching total top-right count).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine column by maximizing uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with fallback; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This groups consecutive isolated top-row positions, essential for distinguishing single/pair/multi handling.)

```python
def handle_single(g: List[List[int]], j: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter, skip_center: bool = True):
    c = g[0][j]
    qual = [i for i in r_cs.get(c, []) if i <= j]
    do_skip = skip_center and (j > half) and (count_c[c] == 1)
    l = max(row_color_col + 1, j - 1)
    r = min(m - 2, j + 1)
    for i in qual:
        for k in range(l, r + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0 and not (do_skip and k == j):
                g[i][k] = c
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1 and g[ii][j] == 0:
                g[ii][j] = c
```
(This handles single isolated top colors by filling horizontal/vertical empties in qualifying rows; skip_center prevents overfill in late isolates. Helpful for core filling logic.)

```python
def handle_pair(g: List[List[int]], j1: int, j2: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter):
    c1 = g[0][j1]
    c2 = g[0][j2]
    qual1 = [i for i in r_cs.get(c1, []) if i <= j1]
    l1 = max(row_color_col + 1, j1 - 1)
    r1 = min(m - 2, j1 + 1)
    for i in qual1:
        for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0:
                g[i][k] = c1
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1:
                for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
                    if g[ii][k] == 0:
                        g[ii][k] = c1
    # Similar block for c2, qual2, l2, r2 (omitted for brevity)
```
(This extends single logic to pairs, adding horizontal fill in vertical offsets; useful for grouped cases but note the incomplete vertical check in the provided code snippet—may need fix for g[ii][j2]==0.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly solved all three training examples, indicating strong handling of spine detection, forbidden color clearing, and basic propagation for standard cases.
 * Worked well: Uniform spine finding, grouping consecutives, filtering true isolates via count matching, and limited fills without overwriting.
 * Did not work fully: In the test output, propagation seems incomplete—e.g., row 3 has a run of 1's filled horizontally but no vertical extension below; row 6 has 3's in middle but zeros persist around them without full flood; forbidden clearing left some potential invalid colors (unknown if input had them).
 * Potential overfill or skip issues: do_skip in handle_single prevented center fills post-half, but in test, some late areas (e.g., columns 14-18 with 4,6,9) have partial fills missing adjacent zeros.
 * r_cs qualification (i <= j) may be too restrictive for test, as some middle rows >j have matching colors but aren't used, leaving empties (e.g., lower 9's not propagating up).
 * handle_pair has a bug: vertical dr loop lacks g[ii][j]==0 check (fills unconditionally if in bounds), and the provided code snippet cuts off qual2 handling—likely causes overfill or asymmetry in pairs.
 * Overall, the program understands core structure (spine, isolates, propagation) but misses nuances in vertical extension for pairs and qualifier filtering, leading to underfill in complex test grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., column 4 all 3's propagated from spine; top row isolates like 1 at col7 filled down to row3; 4's and 6's in cols14-17 partially extended horizontally/vertically), which makes sense for basic rules but looks incomplete and incorrect overall.
 * Observed: Many zeros remain in middle/right areas (e.g., rows 2-5, cols6-13 mostly zero except sparse 1's and 9's; row10 has 6's but no fill left/right beyond; bottom rows 12-14 have minimal changes, missing expected propagation from top 9's or 1's).
 * Differences from expected: Expected fuller fills based on patterns (e.g., the 1 in row2 col7 should propagate more vertically/horizontally via qualifiers, but stops abruptly; 8 in row14 col6 and 3's in row14 cols10-11 suggest unpaired fills missing; top-right 9's dominate but don't flood lower empties as in training). It underfills compared to likely complete solution, possibly due to strict i<=j in qualifiers or pair handling bug—e.g., no clear pair grouping visible in output.
 * Does not look fully correct: Leaves isolated zeros in propagate-able areas (e.g., around row7 col19=3, should extend left), and some fills like row3 cols5-9=3,1,1,1,1 seem arbitrary/not matching color source; unknown why bottom row14 mirrors top but with extras like 8,1,9's not cleared if forbidden.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:33:12] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero-valued cells with colors propagated from a central "spine" column (identified by uniform non-zero colors in middle rows) based on patterns in the top and bottom border rows, following rules for special columns, groups of adjacent specials, and forbidden color clearances. The propagation involves filling horizontal and vertical adjacent zeros in qualified middle rows, with variations for single specials, pairs, or larger groups, while respecting borders and color counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column where middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) share the same non-zero color, maximizing the count of such matches; if none, fall back to uniform color check.
 * Special columns are non-zero cells in the border row (top or bottom) that differ from both immediate neighbors, starting from right of the spine+1 to m-2.
 * Group consecutive special columns into clusters; treat singles with basic horizontal/vertical fill in qualified rows (rows with the special's color in the spine+1 column, within distance constraints), pairs with enhanced filling including extra horizontals in adjacent rows for the second special, triples as two singles (first and last), and larger groups as individual singles.
 * Clear forbidden colors (from border non-zeros right of spine) in all rows left of the spine to prevent invalid overlaps.
 * Set the last column in middle rows to match the spine+1 column's color.
 * Qualified rows for propagation are limited by distance from the special column (e.g., row i <= j for top border) and must have the propagating color in the spine+1 column.
 * Skip certain fills if the special is right of grid half and its color appears only once in the border right of spine.
 * Handle top and bottom borders separately with mirrored logic (e.g., row constraints flip for bottom).
 * Subtle: Propagation only fills zeros and doesn't overwrite non-zeros; vertical fills are only to immediate adjacent rows; horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of special but starting from spine+1.
 * Border=0 for top, border=n-1 for bottom; avoid filling borders themselves.
 * If no spine or spine+1 out of bounds, return unchanged grid.
 * Grids are n rows by m columns, assume rectangular and n>=3 for processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    # Finds the spine column as described; helpful for core identification.

    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = g[border][j]
        left = g[border][j - 1]
        right = g[border][j + 1]
        if c != 0 and c != left and c != right:
            special.append(j)

                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```

```python
def do_single(g: List[List[int]], j: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter, border: int = 0):
    # Handles single special propagation; basic version, useful but needs pairing logic.
    # (Full implementation as in attempt; includes qual row filtering, skip logic, horizontal/vertical fills.)
    pass  # Placeholder; actual code fills horizontals in [l,r] and verticals in adj rows at j.

def do_pair(g: List[List[int]], j1: int, j2: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter, border: int = 0):
    # Handles pair propagation; key subtlety with extra horizontal fill for second special in adj rows.
    # (Full implementation as in attempt; calls do_single-like logic twice with additions.)
    pass  # Placeholder.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided correctly identifies the spine and specials, groups them, and applies basic propagation rules, which worked for training example 3 (full match, indicating core logic handles some cases well).
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Overfilled horizontals for color 6 in row 9 (generated [...,6,6,6,6,...] vs expected [...,6,0,0,0,...]), likely due to incorrect range expansion or missing skip logic for right-half singles; also filled row 8 col 6 with 6 (generated has 6 vs expected 0), suggesting vertical propagation overreached; row 5 col 7-8 filled with 7 (generated 7,7 vs expected 0,0? wait, expected row 5 is [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,7,7,0,...] so partial match but extras); forbidden clearing worked as left side is zeroed properly.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Overfilled 4's in multiple rows (e.g., row 1 generated [...,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [...,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4], filling where zeros should remain); row 4 generated fills 4's in cols 7-10 vs expected zeros except 5 in col 9; row 6 generated [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,4,0,5,0,0,0,5] but expected [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5] (extra 4 in col 8); suggests pair handling overpropagates horizontals without checking overlaps or qual rows strictly; bottom propagation mismatched 7's in row 7 (generated partial but extras).
 * Spine detection worked in all (e.g., col 4 as spine in ex1 with color 3); forbidden clearing effective in ex1 (left cols zeroed); last col setting correct.
 * do_pair function adds extra horizontals for second special, which helped ex3 but caused overfill in ex1/ex2 (e.g., unnecessary adj row fills); do_single's skip for half+ and count==1 prevented some but not all overfills.
 * group_specials correctly clusters but triple handling (as two singles) may miss middle interactions.
 * Overall, propagation ranges (l=max(row_color_col+1, j-1), r=min(m-2,j+1)) are too broad for some colors, leading to fills beyond intended blobs; qual row filtering by distance (i<=j for top) works but may need tighter bounds.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs attempted; code assumes propagation without verifying connected components post-fill, which could help debug overfills.
 * The program returns unchanged if n<3 or no spine, which is a good edge case handle.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills based on spine (likely col 4 with color 3), propagating 9's, 1's, 4's, 6's from top/bottom specials, but appears overfilled: e.g., row 3 has [...,3,1,1,1,1,0,...] suggesting horizontal fill for 1's expanded to 4 cells, but mentally applying rules (special at col7=1 differing from 9's?), qual rows for 1 might be limited, expected probably [...,3,1,0,1,0,...] or less to match sparse pattern; row 6 has [...,3,9,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] with isolated 3's, but generated fills vertical 9's adj but skips some, looks plausible but row 12 [...,3,9,1,1,1,0,...] overfills 1's horizontally like ex1 error.
 * Fills in row 7 [...,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,...] create a 3-block, which makes sense for group propagation, but row 10 [...,3,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6,6,0,...] has partial 6's; expected likely more restrained, e.g., no full horizontals unless pair.
 * Bottom rows (13-14) have 1's and 9's filled, but row 14 [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems to propagate 9's rightward excessively from col7=8 special? (differs from 9's), but 8 not propagated, looks incorrect as it blends 1/9 without clear qual rows.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: overfills horizontals for 1's and 9's similar to training errors, missing sparse isolation (e.g., row 3 should have fewer 1's); vertical fills seem right (e.g., 6's in rows 9-10), but lacks checks for color conflicts or blob connectivity; to fix, tighten horizontal ranges or add post-fill validation against border patterns.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds column j in middle_rows with most uniform non-zero color (max_count of same color), or first uniform non-zero if none.
    # Helpful for identifying central propagation anchor, but may need refinement for ties or partial uniformity.
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]

            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated colors in top row (differs from left/right neighbors) after row_color_col, up to m-2.
    # Useful for detecting seed points to fill middle rows, but limited to post-spine and may miss left or end cases.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-filling puzzle where colors from the top and bottom rows propagate into the middle rows based on patterns, likely forming "objects" or "blobs" guided by a central "spine" column of consistent color, with rules for filling adjacent cells, avoiding forbidden colors, and handling special transition points in the top row. The goal is to complete the grid by filling zeros with appropriate colors while preserving existing non-zero cells and ensuring symmetry or pattern matching across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) that has the most consistent non-zero color; if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column—subtlety: this spine guides propagation to the rightmost column but only if it's not at the edge.
 * Propagate the color from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) to the last column (m-1) in middle rows, but only for non-zero values.
 * Clear "forbidden" colors in left-side columns (0 to spine-1) of middle rows if those colors appear non-zero in the top or bottom rows from spine to end—this prevents overlap or invalid extensions, but it's easy to miss that forbidden is a set of colors from borders only in right half.
 * Group "specials": these are columns in the top row (from row_color_col+1 to m-2) where the color changes from neighbors (c != left and c != right), indicating starts/ends of patterns; subtlety: group consecutive specials into clusters, and handle singles vs. groups differently (e.g., singles may skip centers under conditions, groups of 2 get extra 3-wide fills in adjacent rows).
 * For filling: Use "homes" (middle rows with the special's color in row_color_col) to fill 3-wide horizontal strips (left=max(row_color_col, j-1) to right=min(m-2, j+1)) in those rows and vertically in adjacent rows (±1), but only zeros and avoiding skips for certain cases; for groups >1, treat as expanded fills without center skips, and for glen=2 add extra 3-wide in adj rows for the second.
 * Subtlety: Half-point (m//2) influences skipping centers for single specials if the color appears only once right of center; also, homes are filtered by row index <= special column j, suggesting left-to-right propagation bias.
 * Border rows (0 and n-1) should remain mostly unchanged except possibly clearing or matching, but code doesn't alter them much—easy to miss that top/bottom guide but aren't filled into.
 * Edge cases: Grids <3 rows return unchanged; no spine or invalid spine returns copy; non-consecutive specials form separate groups; all-zero columns in specials ignored.
 * General: Preserve all existing non-zeros; fills only to zeros; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; patterns seem to form vertical/horizontal extensions of top-row blobs into middle, like a "shadow" or "support" structure.

        c = grid_out[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid_out[0][j - 1] and c != grid_out[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special

                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(These are useful for detecting and clustering transition points in the top row, essential for targeted filling.)

```python
r_cs = defaultdict(list)
for i in middle_rows:
    c = g_out[i][row_color_col]
    if c != 0:
        r_cs[c].append(i)
```
(This defaultdict collects "homes" per color from the row_color_col, key for selecting rows to fill.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the spine in all training examples (e.g., likely column 4 with color 3 in Train 1), propagates to the last column accurately (e.g., ends with 3/4/7/6 as expected), and clears some forbidden left-side cells (e.g., zeros out many left positions in middle rows).
 * What worked: Grouping specials correctly detects transitions (e.g., in Train 1, specials around columns for 6,4,7,6 changes); basic 3-wide fills for singles and groups partially match, like filling 4/7 blobs in rows 4-7 of Train 1; vertical propagation to adj rows works in places (e.g., row 6 in Train 1 gets 7s).
 * What didn't work: Over-fills or incorrect fills in unexpected places, e.g., in Train 1, top row (row 0) position 1 filled with 4 (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]), and row 11 position 1 also 4 vs 0—suggests unintended border modification or propagation leak; in row 4 of Train 1, position 8 has 4 but expected 0? Wait, actually rows 0-11 generated vs expected show minor diffs like row 4 pos 4:4 vs 4 (match), but overall mismatches in left fills.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 4s in top/bottom left (pos 1), and row 5 pos 17:3 vs expected 3 (match?), but row 9 pos 4:6 vs 6 (match)—diffs mainly in borders and some middle left (e.g., row 3 pos 9:4 vs 0? No, row 3: [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] vs expected same, wait—actually close but says INCORRECT, likely subtle like row 4 pos 8:4 vs 0? Upon close check, generated row 4 has pos 8:4 but expected pos 8:0 in some? No, expected row 4: [0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]—yes, pos 8:4 matches, but perhaps row 0/11 extras are the issue; unknown why borders got filled.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated fills too many 4s/7s in middle, e.g., row 1 pos 9-11:4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0; row 2 pos 10:4 vs 7; row 4 pos 7-12:0,4,4,4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0,5,0,0; row 5 pos 5:5 vs 5 (match), but row 6 pos 9:5 vs 5 (match)—over-filling groups without proper skipping or home filtering; also top row pos 1:5 vs 0.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated top row pos 1:3 vs 0; row 1 pos 7:0 vs 0 (match), but row 2 pos 7:3 vs 3 (match?); row 6 pos 13:6 vs 6 (match), but row 8 pos 0-2:7,7,7 vs 7,7,7 (match)—diffs in left fills like row 0 pos 1:3 vs 0, and some middle like row 3 pos 4:3 vs 3 (match), but row 6 pos 4:6 vs 6; seems extra border fills and incomplete clears (e.g., row 9 pos 1-3:0,0,0 vs 0,0,0).
 * Overall: The filling logic for groups (esp. glen=2 with extra adj fills) over-extends horizontally/vertically, ignoring some zero preservations; skip_center logic doesn't trigger properly (e.g., in Train 1 single 6 at pos 6?); home filtering (ii <= j) may be too restrictive or not applied consistently; no extraction of full "objects" or blobs, so misses holistic shape matching—consider adding a function to validate blob connectivity post-fill.
 * Function find_spine is helpful and seems accurate; find_specials and group_specials are useful but may mis-detect if top row has zeros or plateaus; r_cs is essential for per-color homes but could be enhanced to check vertical consistency; the glen>=3 handling as "non-skipping singles" works partially but leads to fragmented fills; no unhelpful functions, but the complex if-else for groups is brittle—easy to miss that for glen=2, first special gets standard fill but second gets extra adj 3-wide, which overfills in Train 2.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits issues from the training failures: e.g., top row (row 0) has pos 1:1 vs likely expected 0 (similar to Train 1/2/3 border overfills); row 12 pos 1:7 vs probably 0; row 14 has many 9s in right but left pos 6-19 overfilled with 9s where patterns like 1-blob or 3/4/6 should be sparser.
 * Middle rows show partial propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3s around pos 5-11, matching a potential 3-blob; row 7-9 have 4s in pos 13-16, good for a 4-group), but overfills like row 3 pos 6-9:1,1,1,1 vs likely narrower (expected might zero some based on top 1 at pos 7); row 10 pos 14-16:6,6,6 good, but row 5 pos 10:3 vs possibly 0 if not a home.
 * Right column (pos 19) consistently filled with 9/1/3/4/6/9 as per propagation, which makes sense if spine is col 4 (3s), but left clears are incomplete (e.g., row 2 pos 7:1 but if 1 forbidden from top, should be 0); vertical fills in adj rows seem spotty, e.g., row 7 pos 5:4 but row 6/8 pos 5:3/0 mismatch.
 * Overall, it partially forms blobs (e.g., 9s in rows 1-2,5,11-14 right-side), but extras like row 14 pos 6:8 (from top?) and missing sparsity in 1/3 areas suggest wrong special grouping or skip logic—does not match expected holistic patterns, likely needs better forbidden application and group handling to avoid dense overfills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero cells (empty spaces) with appropriate color numbers based on patterns, symmetries, and propagation rules across rows and columns, likely simulating object placement or contour filling in a 2D scene with top/bottom borders and middle "body" rows that extend or match colors from a central "spine" structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that act as fixed borders or outlines, while middle rows (1 to n-2) are where most filling/propagation occurs, often mirroring or extending patterns from these borders without overwriting non-zero cells.
 * Identify a "spine" column (or near it) in middle rows where a single consistent non-zero color dominates vertically; this serves as an anchor for horizontal propagation to the right (e.g., filling the last column with the spine's color) and vertical influences.
 * "Forbidden" colors are collected from top/bottom rows to the right of the spine and used to clear conflicting colors to the left of the spine in middle rows, ensuring no bleed-over from border patterns.
 * "Special" columns are isolated non-zero cells in the top row that differ from immediate neighbors (e.g., peaks or isolated features); these trigger targeted filling in middle rows for matching colors, often limited to homes (rows) associated with that color and propagating horizontally within bounds (e.g., j-1 to j+1, but adjusted near edges) and vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Color "homes" are middle rows grouped by their color in a key column (spine+1), and filling for specials is restricted to homes "below" or at the special's position (e.g., ii <= j), suggesting a downward or positional hierarchy.
 * Propagation is conservative: only fill zeros, avoid overwriting existing non-zeros, and respect grid edges (e.g., no filling beyond m-2 or before spine+1 in some cases); vertical propagation is limited to immediate adjacent rows (dr = -1,1) and only if target is zero.
 * Subtleties: Spine detection prioritizes columns with the most consistent non-zero color in middle rows, falling back to any uniform non-zero; specials skip edge cases (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2). Filling for specials may need to extend further right/left in some cases (e.g., for wider objects like the 7s in train1 row5/6/7). Edge handling is critical near m-3 or later, where left bounds shift rightward. No filling if n<3. Patterns suggest symmetry or object completion (e.g., filling blobs like 7s horizontally across multiple columns if aligned).
 * Across attempts, over-filling or under-filling occurs: e.g., missing horizontal extensions for colors like 7 in train1 (row5 col11=7 expected but 0 generated), incorrect vertical fills (train3 row6 col12=0 expected but 6 generated), or misplaced propagations (train2 row4 col7=0 expected but 4 generated). Test grid shows complex interactions with multiple colors (3,9,1,4,6,7,8) and potential multi-spine or irregular objects.

        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated non-zero cells in top row differing from neighbors, starting after row_color_col.
    # Useful for detecting key features to propagate, but skips m-1 and assumes top row as reference.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies spines in simple cases (e.g., col4 with color 3 in train1/2/3 middles) and propagates last-column fills accurately (e.g., all 3s in train1 middles col17).
 * What worked: Clearing forbidden colors left of spine (e.g., train1 row1-11 col0-3 cleared to 0 where conflicting); basic home grouping by color in row_color_col (spine+1); vertical propagation for specials in adjacent rows if zero (e.g., train3 row7 col11=6 from row6).
 * What didn't work: Under-fills horizontal extensions for specials (train1 row5 col12=0 generated but 7 expected; train1 row7 col9-11=7,7,7 expected but partial/missing); over-fills or misplaces in specials (train2 row4 col7=4 generated but 0 expected; train2 row2 col10=4 generated but 7 expected); incorrect spine fallback or special bounds (train3 row6 col12=6 generated but 0 expected, possibly from over-propagation of 6 homes).
 * Train1: Generated misses 7s in row5 col12, row7 col9-10 (under-fill blob); row3 col17=3 correct but row4 col17=4 expected (wrong last-col prop for color4 row); row8 col9=0 generated but 7 expected (missed vertical from row7).
 * Train2: Generated over-fills row1 col9-10=4,4 but expected 0,0; row2 col10=4 but 7 expected (wrong color prop); row4 col7=4 but 0 expected; row5 col9=4 but 5 expected (misplaced 5); row6 col13-14=0,0 but expected 0,0 correct, but overall pattern mismatches border extensions.
 * Train3: Generated row6 col12=6 but 0 expected (over-fill right of 6); row6 col10=0 but 6 expected (under-fill 6 blob); row7 col12=6 but 0 expected (vertical over-prop).
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; current program lacks blob detection (e.g., connected components for colors like 7s or 4s) which could help complete shapes.
 * Function `program` overall is a good skeleton (copies grid, handles n<3) but broken in special filling bounds/logic (e.g., l/r ranges too narrow, ignores wider objects); find_spine helpful but may pick wrong col if ties; find_specials useful but misses if specials in bottom row or non-top.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., consistent 3s in col4 middles as potential spine, last-col fills like 9s/3s/4s/6s match row colors in col5; some clearings left of col4 to 0s; vertical fills like row7 col19=3 from row6) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Issues: Under-fills apparent blobs, e.g., row6 col5=3, col9=3, col10=3, col11=3 but col12=0 (likely needs horizontal extension to match expected 3 blob from border); row7 col14-16=4,4,4 correct but row8 col14-16=4,4,4 overwrites? Wait, generated has them as 4s but if forbidden, should clear—unclear without rules, but pattern suggests row8 col10=0 should fill to 3? from row7 col10=3.
 * Over-fills or misses: row3 col5-9=1,1,1,1,0 but top has 1 at col7, suggests special at col7=1, but generated row3 col9=0 (under-fill right); row12 col1=7 but top/middle suggest 7s in left cols, possibly forbidden clear missed; row13 col19=9 correct but row11 col19=9 from prop, yet row10 col17=0 but expected 6 extension from row9 col15-17=4,6,6? (wait, color mismatch).
 * Test has irregular features (e.g., 8s in row13-14 col2-3, 7s in row12 col1/3, multiple 9 blobs in top/bottom), so output misses completing 9s in middles (e.g., row1-2 col5=9 but col6=0 generated, likely needs fill); 1 in row3 col7 propagates poorly (only row3 col5-8=1s, but row12 col5=1 suggests vertical but not filled). Does not account for potential multi-specials or color-specific widths (e.g., 6 in row9 col15-17 needs wider prop than 1-col).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with numbers representing colors and 0s as empty cells) needs to be completed by propagating colors from top/bottom rows into middle rows based on structural patterns like vertical "spines" (consistent color columns), horizontal "special" positions in the top row (unique colors differing from neighbors), and grouping/processing rules to fill shapes or connections without overwriting existing cells or violating forbidden color rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns; top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows provide pattern templates that propagate downward into middle rows (1 to n-2), but only where cells are 0; existing non-zero cells must be respected.
 * Identify a "spine" as a column j where middle rows have the most consistent non-zero color (all same and non-zero); use the next column (j+1) as a "row_color_col" for vertical propagation to the right edge (column m-1).
 * "Forbidden" colors are those appearing in top/bottom rows from the spine onward; clear them from middle rows left of the spine to avoid conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color is non-zero and differs from both immediate neighbors (j-1 and j+1); these trigger horizontal or vertical fillings.
 * Group consecutive specials into clusters; single specials or non-pairs fill horizontally around them in qualifying middle rows (rows with matching color at row_color_col, and row index <= max special column), but skip centers conditionally (e.g., if top row has <2 of that color and not at grid center).
 * For pairs of consecutive specials (glen==2), apply special filling: propagate downward with gaps, fill adjacent cells (e.g., +1 column), and handle vertical extensions above/below if zero.
 * Subtleties: Fillings must check bounds (1 <= row <= n-2, etc.); for pairs, ensure exactly one qualifying row per color with specific spacing (e.g., h2 == h1 + 2); near-end specials (j+1 == m-2) avoid certain extensions; center filling (j == m//2) is forced; pairs override some skips.
 * Collect row-color mappings (r_cs) from middle rows at row_color_col for qualifying homes; only fill if exact match in count and position.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation to right edge only if middle row color at row_color_col is non-zero; clear left-side forbidden colors only if they match top/bottom from spine rightward; for non-pairs, horizontal fill range is l = max(row_color_col+1, j-1) to r = min(m-2, j+1), but skip center if conditions met and it was zero, then potentially fill vertically in adjacent rows.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes shape completion (e.g., blobs, lines) without expansion beyond patterns, respecting vertical consistency and horizontal uniqueness.

    return groups
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * process_group: Overly complex and buggy; mishandles pair vs. non-pair logic, leading to overfilling (e.g., extra verticals or horizontals); the skipped_center vertical fill ignores bounds properly but applies too broadly; color_specials defaultdict groups by top color but doesn't validate against expected shapes.
 * The pair-specific logic in main program (after process_group for glen==2): Attempts gap filling (h1+1) and lower extensions (h2+1 with jj range), but conditions like qual_h2[0] == qual_h1[0] + 2 are too rigid and fail when rows aren't exactly spaced; also fills j1+3 which may exceed patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of spine detection, forbidden clearing, and special grouping, but fails on precise filling rules, leading to overfills, underfills, or misplaced colors in all training cases.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly places a 4 at row0 col1 (should be 0, as top row patterns shouldn't propagate left/upward); also minor overfill in row4 col4 (3 instead of 4? but grids match closely otherwise); underfills or skips some vertical extensions in rows 5-7 for color 4/7 blobs; the spine (likely col3=2) propagates correctly to right edge, but specials (e.g., around col5=3, col9=4, col10=7) trigger wrong horizontal ranges, missing expected 0s in some centers.
 * Train 1 mismatches top row integrity for unknown reason (extra 4 at start, possibly from unhandled propagation); bottom row also has extra 4 at col1, symmetric error; process_group fills too many horizontals in non-pair groups, but pair handling (if any) is absent here.
 * Train 2: Generated overfills top/bottom rows with 5 at col1 (expected 0s); underfills row1/8 with 4s instead of patterned 7s at col7/11; row5 has 5s but expected more sparse 5s with 0s; row6 underfills 5s; specials (e.g., col9=5, col11=7) group poorly, leading to missing vertical 7s in rows 1/3/7/9 and horizontal 7s in row1 col7; pair logic (cols 7-8=7s? but top has 4,7,4) fails spacing check, so no gap fills.
 * Train 2 has broken forbidden clearing (allows 5s left of spine); extract-like r_cs works for color 3/4 but not 5/7/8; process_group skips centers incorrectly, filling extras like row2 col14=0 to 7 (expected 0).
 * Train 3: Generated overfills row2 col7=0 to 3 (expected 0, but row3 has 3s); underfills row5 col7=0 (expected 3? no, expected has 3 only in row3); row6 has 6 at col4 but expected vertical 6s sparse; row7 underfills col11=0 to 6 (expected 6); row8 overfills left with 7s at col0-2 (expected full 7s but pattern is horizontal bar); specials (col7=3, col11=6) not filling downward correctly for color 3 in row5.
 * Train 3 mismatches blob shapes for 3/6 (unknown reason, possibly wrong l/r ranges in process_group); pair handling absent, but no pairs here; find_spine likely picks col3=1 correctly, but propagation misses vertical skips.
 * Across attempts: Spine and r_cs collection work well (consistent verticals for main color like 3); grouping specials catches uniques but processing overfills horizontals (e.g., filling beyond j-1 to j+1); pair code is untriggered or buggy (no exact h1/h2 spacing); forbidden set clears left side partially but misses top/bottom symmetries.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overpropagates color 9 vertically in many middle rows (e.g., rows 1-2,5-6,11-12 all have 9 at col5, but expected likely sparser based on top pattern [...,9,9,1,9,...] suggesting 1 as a special interrupt); underfills horizontals for color 1 in row3 (fills 1s at col5-8, but col9+ should be 0 unless grouped); row6 has 3s at col5-9 but top has no 3 special there (top col5=3? wait, top row0 col4=3, but specials start after spine); row13 has 1 at col5 but vertical from top col7=1? inconsistent.
 * Missing vertical extensions for 4/6 in rows 7-8/9-10 (only partial, expected full blobs like in train2); overfills row14 bottom with 9s everywhere rightward, ignoring specials like col6=8, col16=6; spine likely col4=3, row_color_col=5, but propagation to col19=9 everywhere ignores forbidden (top has 1,4,6,8); no pair handling visible (e.g., cols16-17=6,9? not filled as pair); overall, looks like aggressive 9-filling from top patterns without respecting uniqueness or gaps, making shapes blob into unintended merges (e.g., 9s connecting across 1/3 barriers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in missing cells (0s) with colors from a palette, guided by patterns on the borders (top and bottom rows) and consistency rules in the middle rows, such as propagating colors along a central "spine" column and handling isolated or grouped color segments to complete symmetric or matching internal structures. The puzzle emphasizes symmetry, color matching across rows, and avoiding forbidden colors while respecting border-defined "special" positions that trigger inward filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns, with top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) borders providing color clues; middle rows (1 to n-2) start partially filled and need propagation without altering borders.
 * Identify a "spine" as the leftmost column j where middle rows have the maximum number of identical non-zero colors (or all matching if no partial matches); if none, default to no changes.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in borders from the spine column rightward; clear left-of-spine cells in all rows if they match forbidden colors.
 * Copy spine-adjacent colors (row_color_col = min(spine+1, m-1)) to the rightmost column (m-1) in middle rows for endpoint consistency.
 * Propagation from borders: Detect "specials" as positions j > row_color_col where border cell differs from both neighbors (isolated or edged colors); group consecutive specials into clusters.
 * For groups of length 2: Propagate each color vertically to qualified middle rows (based on position constraints like min_i/max_i relative to j) and horizontally to adjacent empty cells, with skips for right-half singles; also fill neighboring rows' same or adjacent columns.
 * For groups >2 or singles: Handle local subsets where color count in group matches border count right of row_color_col; extend fill ranges for end positions; special cases for small singles (glen==1) limit fills to center or left-adjacent in upper/lower rows, avoiding overfill in right half; only propagate if specials exist beyond m//2 for bottom border.
 * Subtle: Directionality (is_top=True for top border uses upward constraints, False for bottom uses downward); avoid filling if count_c[c] ==1 and j > half+1 to prevent overpropagation; r_cs tracks rows per color at row_color_col for qualification.
 * Easy to miss: All fills only to 0 cells; no changes if no spine; border_row param in find_specials allows bottom propagation; qual lists filter rows by positional bounds (e.g., for top: ii <= j, for bottom: n-1-j <= ii).
 * General: Grids may have varying widths (m=14-20); colors are integers 1+; symmetry often mirrored top-bottom; unfilled areas remain 0.
 * Considerations across attempts: Propagation can overfill (e.g., placing colors where expected 0) or underfill (missing chains); group handling fails on non-consecutive specials; spine detection may pick wrong column if partial matches tie.

Wait, no—row 6 generated [0,0,0,2,7,0,...] matches expected, but overall mismatches in 6 and 7 blobs suggest wrong qual filtering or skip logic.
 * Train 2: Underfilled row 2 cols9-12 with 7s missing one (generated [...,7,0,7,7,0,7] vs expected [...,0,7,7,7,0,7]? Wait, expected has 7 at col9); overfilled row 6 col9 with 5 (generated [...,5,0,7,...] vs expected [...,0,7,...]—unknown why, possibly erroneous single-group fill); row 8 matches top but bottom propagation failed symmetrically.
 * Train 3: Underfilled row 2 col6 with 0 (generated [...,2,0,3,0,...] vs expected [...,2,0,0,3,...]—shifted 3 placement); row 6 has 6 at col13 missing (generated [...,0,0,0,6,0,2] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6]); row 6 col4=6 matches but chain incomplete; suggests issues in left-end/right-end extensions for glen>2 and single fills in right half.
 * Spine detection worked in all (e.g., col3=1 or 2 consistent), forbidden clearing partial (left cols zeroed correctly), but propagation over/underfills due to qual bounds (e.g., min_i/max_i too restrictive) or do_skip misapplied.
 * find_specials and group_specials are helpful for border analysis but may miss non-consecutive edges if neighbors match indirectly; r_cs defaultdict for color-row mapping is essential for targeted fills.
 * The main program(g) structure is solid (copy grid, apply spine/forbidden, then propagate top/bottom), but propagate_from_border is overly complex and buggy in group cases (e.g., local_js subsetting ignores some colors; upper/lower fills inconsistent for small singles).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem puzzle-relevant, though the all-matching fallback in find_spine may be too greedy (picks first, not max).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially matches expected patterns but appears incorrect overall, as it underfills several areas: e.g., row 6 has 3-chain at cols9-11 but expected likely extends to col4 or mirrors top 1-chain; row 7 has 4-chain at cols13-15 but misses potential left extension or 0s; row 9 has isolated 6s but no connecting fills, suggesting incomplete single-group propagation.
 * Overfills evident in row 12 col1=7 (possibly forbidden leak) and row 14 cols16-19 with 9s where borders suggest sparsity; rightmost col19 consistently 9 or matching, which seems correct, but middle row12 has 1-chain at cols5-8 matching top but bottom row13/14 have mismatched 8/9 intrusions.
 * Does not look fully correct—lacks symmetry (e.g., top row2 col6=1 not mirrored in bottom equivalents); 4 and 6 in lower middle (rows7-10) seem truncated vs border clues (row0 has 4 at col14,6 at col15); likely misses key considerations like half=m//2=10 skips for right-half specials, leading to sparse right side.
 * To handle test: Ensure qual for bottom uses correct n-1-j bounds; extend r for left_ends properly; account for larger m=20 with more groups.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero-valued cells with colors propagated from a central "spine" column (identified by uniform non-zero colors in middle rows) based on patterns in the top and bottom border rows, following rules for special columns, groups of adjacent specials, and forbidden color clearances. The propagation involves filling horizontal and vertical adjacent zeros in qualified middle rows, with variations for single specials, pairs, or larger groups, while respecting borders and color counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column where middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) share the same non-zero color, maximizing the count of such matches; if none, fall back to uniform color check.
 * Special columns are non-zero cells in the border row (top or bottom) that differ from both immediate neighbors, starting from right of the spine+1 to m-2.
 * Group consecutive special columns into clusters; treat singles with basic horizontal/vertical fill in qualified rows (rows with the special's color in the spine+1 column, within distance constraints), pairs with enhanced filling including extra horizontals in adjacent rows for the second special, triples as two singles (first and last), and larger groups as individual singles.
 * Clear forbidden colors (from border non-zeros right of spine) in all rows left of the spine to prevent invalid overlaps.
 * Set the last column in middle rows to match the spine+1 column's color.
 * Qualified rows for propagation are limited by distance from the special column (e.g., row i <= j for top border) and must have the propagating color in the spine+1 column.
 * Skip certain fills if the special is right of grid half and its color appears only once in the border right of spine.
 * Handle top and bottom borders separately with mirrored logic (e.g., row constraints flip for bottom).
 * Subtle: Propagation only fills zeros and doesn't overwrite non-zeros; vertical fills are only to immediate adjacent rows; horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of special but starting from spine+1.
 * Border=0 for top, border=n-1 for bottom; avoid filling borders themselves.
 * If no spine or spine+1 out of bounds, return unchanged grid.
 * Grids are n rows by m columns, assume rectangular and n>=3 for processing.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided correctly identifies the spine and specials, groups them, and applies basic propagation rules, which worked for training example 3 (full match, indicating core logic handles some cases well).
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Overfilled horizontals for color 6 in row 9 (generated [...,6,6,6,6,...] vs expected [...,6,0,0,0,...]), likely due to incorrect range expansion or missing skip logic for right-half singles; also filled row 8 col 6 with 6 (generated has 6 vs expected 0), suggesting vertical propagation overreached; row 5 col 7-8 filled with 7 (generated 7,7 vs expected 0,0? wait, expected row 5 is [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,7,7,0,...] so partial match but extras); forbidden clearing worked as left side is zeroed properly.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Overfilled 4's in multiple rows (e.g., row 1 generated [...,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [...,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4], filling where zeros should remain); row 4 generated fills 4's in cols 7-10 vs expected zeros except 5 in col 9; row 6 generated [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,4,0,5,0,0,0,5] but expected [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5] (extra 4 in col 8); suggests pair handling overpropagates horizontals without checking overlaps or qual rows strictly; bottom propagation mismatched 7's in row 7 (generated partial but extras).
 * Spine detection worked in all (e.g., col 4 as spine in ex1 with color 3); forbidden clearing effective in ex1 (left cols zeroed); last col setting correct.
 * do_pair function adds extra horizontals for second special, which helped ex3 but caused overfill in ex1/ex2 (e.g., unnecessary adj row fills); do_single's skip for half+ and count==1 prevented some but not all overfills.
 * group_specials correctly clusters but triple handling (as two singles) may miss middle interactions.
 * Overall, propagation ranges (l=max(row_color_col+1, j-1), r=min(m-2,j+1)) are too broad for some colors, leading to fills beyond intended blobs; qual row filtering by distance (i<=j for top) works but may need tighter bounds.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs attempted; code assumes propagation without verifying connected components post-fill, which could help debug overfills.
 * The program returns unchanged if n<3 or no spine, which is a good edge case handle.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills based on spine (likely col 4 with color 3), propagating 9's, 1's, 4's, 6's from top/bottom specials, but appears overfilled: e.g., row 3 has [...,3,1,1,1,1,0,...] suggesting horizontal fill for 1's expanded to 4 cells, but mentally applying rules (special at col7=1 differing from 9's?), qual rows for 1 might be limited, expected probably [...,3,1,0,1,0,...] or less to match sparse pattern; row 6 has [...,3,9,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] with isolated 3's, but generated fills vertical 9's adj but skips some, looks plausible but row 12 [...,3,9,1,1,1,0,...] overfills 1's horizontally like ex1 error.
 * Fills in row 7 [...,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,...] create a 3-block, which makes sense for group propagation, but row 10 [...,3,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6,6,0,...] has partial 6's; expected likely more restrained, e.g., no full horizontals unless pair.
 * Bottom rows (13-14) have 1's and 9's filled, but row 14 [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems to propagate 9's rightward excessively from col7=8 special? (differs from 9's), but 8 not propagated, looks incorrect as it blends 1/9 without clear qual rows.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: overfills horizontals for 1's and 9's similar to training errors, missing sparse isolation (e.g., row 3 should have fewer 1's); vertical fills seem right (e.g., 6's in rows 9-10), but lacks checks for color conflicts or blob connectivity; to fix, tighten horizontal ranges or add post-fill validation against border patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by prioritizing maximum uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with a fallback for any uniform column; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by numbers, with 0 as empty) where the goal is to fill in empty cells (zeros) based on propagation rules from a central "spine" column in the middle rows, while respecting forbidden colors from the top and bottom borders, and specially handling isolated or grouped unique colors in the top row to extend them downward and sideways into empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The spine is a column (often around the middle) that must have the most uniform non-zero color across middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in the top or bottom row to the right of the spine; these must be cleared (set to 0) from all positions left of the spine across the entire grid to prevent invalid propagation.
 * After identifying the spine, propagate its color (from row_color_col = spine + 1) to the rightmost column in all middle rows where it's non-zero.
 * Special "potential" columns are isolated top-row colors (non-zero, different from left and right neighbors) to the right of row_color_col; group consecutive ones and handle singles (fill adjacent empties in qualifying middle rows) or pairs (similar but extended vertically) differently, with skips for center positions if isolated and post-half grid.
 * Qualifying rows for propagation are middle rows (1 to n-2) that have the color in row_color_col, but only those <= the special column index for horizontal fills.
 * Horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of the special column (or from row_color_col+1), vertical fills go up/down 1 row from qualifying rows but only into empties, and for pairs, vertical also fills horizontal neighbors in those offset rows.
 * Subtle: For singles post-half grid with count 1, skip filling the center (k==j) to avoid overfill; for groups >2, treat as singles without skip. Ensure no overwriting of non-zeros.
 * Grid edges (rows 0 and n-1, columns 0 and m-1) are borders and not filled in middle propagation; n<3 grids unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only into zeros, not overwriting; r_cs tracks middle rows per color in row_color_col for qualifiers; isol_count tracks how many potentials per color to filter true isolates (those matching total top-right count).

                    if g[ii][k] == 0:
                        g[ii][k] = c1
    # Similar block for c2, qual2, l2, r2 (omitted for brevity)
```
(This extends single logic to pairs, adding horizontal fill in vertical offsets; useful for grouped cases but note the incomplete vertical check in the provided code snippet—may need fix for g[ii][j2]==0.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly solved all three training examples, indicating strong handling of spine detection, forbidden color clearing, and basic propagation for standard cases.
 * Worked well: Uniform spine finding, grouping consecutives, filtering true isolates via count matching, and limited fills without overwriting.
 * Did not work fully: In the test output, propagation seems incomplete—e.g., row 3 has a run of 1's filled horizontally but no vertical extension below; row 6 has 3's in middle but zeros persist around them without full flood; forbidden clearing left some potential invalid colors (unknown if input had them).
 * Potential overfill or skip issues: do_skip in handle_single prevented center fills post-half, but in test, some late areas (e.g., columns 14-18 with 4,6,9) have partial fills missing adjacent zeros.
 * r_cs qualification (i <= j) may be too restrictive for test, as some middle rows >j have matching colors but aren't used, leaving empties (e.g., lower 9's not propagating up).
 * handle_pair has a bug: vertical dr loop lacks g[ii][j]==0 check (fills unconditionally if in bounds), and the provided code snippet cuts off qual2 handling—likely causes overfill or asymmetry in pairs.
 * Overall, the program understands core structure (spine, isolates, propagation) but misses nuances in vertical extension for pairs and qualifier filtering, leading to underfill in complex test grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., column 4 all 3's propagated from spine; top row isolates like 1 at col7 filled down to row3; 4's and 6's in cols14-17 partially extended horizontally/vertically), which makes sense for basic rules but looks incomplete and incorrect overall.
 * Observed: Many zeros remain in middle/right areas (e.g., rows 2-5, cols6-13 mostly zero except sparse 1's and 9's; row10 has 6's but no fill left/right beyond; bottom rows 12-14 have minimal changes, missing expected propagation from top 9's or 1's).
 * Differences from expected: Expected fuller fills based on patterns (e.g., the 1 in row2 col7 should propagate more vertically/horizontally via qualifiers, but stops abruptly; 8 in row14 col6 and 3's in row14 cols10-11 suggest unpaired fills missing; top-right 9's dominate but don't flood lower empties as in training). It underfills compared to likely complete solution, possibly due to strict i<=j in qualifiers or pair handling bug—e.g., no clear pair grouping visible in output.
 * Does not look fully correct: Leaves isolated zeros in propagate-able areas (e.g., around row7 col19=3, should extend left), and some fills like row3 cols5-9=3,1,1,1,1 seem arbitrary/not matching color source; unknown why bottom row14 mirrors top but with extras like 8,1,9's not cleared if forbidden.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:38:02] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where numbers represent colors in a 2D grid, and the objective is to fill in zero-valued (empty) cells by propagating colors from a central "spine" column (identified by consistent non-zero colors in middle rows) and top/bottom rows, while respecting forbidden colors on the left side and handling "special" isolated color positions in the top row to extend patterns horizontally and vertically in a structured way. The process involves symmetry-like filling, avoiding overwrites, and conditional extensions based on counts and positions to complete symmetric or patterned objects across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column as the leftmost column (j) where middle rows (1 to n-2) have the maximum number of identical non-zero colors; if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * Use the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col = spine + 1) as a propagation source: copy its colors from middle rows to the last column (m-1) if non-zero.
 * Forbid colors appearing in the top/bottom rows to the right of the spine (from j=spine to m-1) from being placed in any left-side positions (j < spine) across all rows, setting them to 0 if present.
 * "Special" positions are isolated non-zero colors in the top row (row 0) starting after row_color_col, where the color differs from both immediate left and right neighbors (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2).
 * For each special j, propagate its color c horizontally in qualifying middle rows (those with c in row_color_col and row index <= j) to empty cells in a small window (j-1 to j+1, clamped to row_color_col+1 to m-2), but skip the center j if j > m//2 and c appears only once in the top row post-row_color_col.
 * Also propagate vertically from those qualifying rows to adjacent middle rows (ii +/-1) at column j if empty, and then horizontally in that adjacent row's window if still empty.
 * Handle consecutive specials (adjacent j1, j2): if both have matching row counts to their top-row special counts, propagate c2 horizontally in adjacent rows of qual2 (rows <= j2 with c2) but only vertically-adjacent expansions, without the center skip logic.
 * Subtlety: Propagation only to zeros, no overwrites; middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; if no specials, stop after basic spine and forbid steps.
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; empty grid unchanged; spine must be < m-1; if spine invalid, return original.
 * Counts like len(r_cs[c]) must match num_specials_c[c] (top-row specials of c) for propagation; qual lists filter by row <= j.
 * Potential misses: Over-propagation in dense areas (e.g., filling unintended blobs); incorrect spine selection if multiple candidates; ignoring half-grid skip for right-side uniques; not handling non-consecutive specials fully; forbidden colors applied too broadly or not at all in left clears.
 * Visual symmetry: Fillings often create mirrored or extended "objects" (connected same-color regions) from top/bottom hints, but only in middle rows via spine; top/bottom rows unchanged.
 * Zero-handling: Zeros in spine or row_color_col skip propagation; non_zero_colors filter ignores zeros for spine uniformity.

# Counter and defaultdict used for counting top-row specials and row-color mappings (r_cs).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided; it correctly handles basic spine detection, forbidden color clearing on left, and last-column copying for training examples 2 and 3.
 * Failed on training example 1: Generated output is nearly identical to expected, but marked INCORRECT—possible subtle difference in a single cell (e.g., row 7, column 10: generated has 7 where expected might differ, or row 4 column 8: 4 vs potential 0; exact diff unknown but confirms over- or under-filling in special propagation).
 * Worked for training 2 and 3: Full correct outputs (not shown, but stated), likely due to proper special handling and no consecutive specials or half-skip issues.
 * Spine fallback logic helped in cases without max-count uniformity.
 * Special propagation with qual filtering and window clamping worked well for isolated cases but may overfill in consecutive specials (as in the partial handling at end of program).
 * Forbidden set application cleared left correctly but might be too aggressive if top/bottom have left-side colors matching right forbids.
 * The consecutive special block at the end is under-developed: it propagates only for c2 in adjacent rows horizontally, but misses symmetric vertical for c1 or full window for both; this could cause misses in train1.
 * r_cs defaultdict and counters (count_c, num_specials_c) are essential for count-matching but may fail if specials overlap colors incorrectly.
 * No extract_objects function; code focuses on procedural filling rather than object detection— this is appropriate as puzzle seems rule-based propagation, not blob extraction.
 * The do_skip logic (for right-half uniques) prevents overfilling but might skip needed centers in some symmetries.
 * Overall, program structure is solid but brittle to special configurations; no handling for bottom-row specials or asymmetric grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies a spine (likely column 4 with 3s in many middle rows), copies 3/1/4/6/9 variants to last column (19), clears left side (columns 0-3) mostly to 0 except preserved 7s/3s, and attempts special propagation (e.g., filling around column 5's 9/1/3/4/6, creating small horizontal extensions like row 6: 3s at 9-10, row 9: 6 at 14).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Under-filling evident, e.g., row 6 has 3,3,3 at columns 9-11 but no vertical extension to row 5/7 at those columns (row 5/7 remain 0 there); row 12 has 7s at 1/3 but no propagation rightward despite potential special at column 5 (1); large top-row 9-runs (e.g., columns 5-7,9-10,12-13,16-18) suggest multiple specials or consecutives, but output misses filling middle rows like row 4/8/10/11 with 9s in windows around them (e.g., row 4 column 5 is 9 but no horizontal to 6-7). Bottom row (14) has fillings like 9s at end but top-like pattern not symmetrically propagated.
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Expected likely has more connected 9-blobs in middle (e.g., filling row 2/3/5 columns 5-7 with 9s from top specials), vertical stacks for 1 at column 5 (rows 3/12 have 1, but no fill between), and 6 extensions in row 9/10 without gaps; generated stops short on vertical/horizontal for consecutives, leaving isolated 0s (e.g., row 7 column 9=0 should be 3?); also, row 13 column 2=7 preserved but may need clearing if forbidden.
 * Test has 15 rows (n=15, m=20), middle_rows=1-13; specials likely at columns 5(9? but neighbors 3,9—wait, top: col4=3,col5=9,col6=9 so not isolated), actually isolates might be col7=1 (neighbors 9,9? wait top row: col5=3? Wait, test input top: [0,0,0,0,3,9,9,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,8,9] so specials e.g. col7=1 (9 left,9 right? no diff), col10=3 (9l,9r no), col14=4 (9l,6r yes), col15=6 (4l,9r yes), col18=8 (9l,9r no); so specials at 14,15—consecutive, but output fills row9 col14=6 but not more vertical/horizontal for 4/6 in qual rows.
 * To handle test: Enhance consecutive logic to bidirectional propagation, add bottom-row special detection, ensure qual includes more rows if counts match loosely; current output misses ~20-30% of expected fills based on pattern symmetry.

[2025-10-01 02:38:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated colors in top row (differs from left/right neighbors) after row_color_col, up to m-2.
    # Useful for detecting seed points to fill middle rows, but limited to post-spine and may miss left or end cases.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-filling puzzle where colors from the top and bottom rows propagate into the middle rows based on patterns, likely forming "objects" or "blobs" guided by a central "spine" column of consistent color, with rules for filling adjacent cells, avoiding forbidden colors, and handling special transition points in the top row. The goal is to complete the grid by filling zeros with appropriate colors while preserving existing non-zero cells and ensuring symmetry or pattern matching across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) that has the most consistent non-zero color; if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column—subtlety: this spine guides propagation to the rightmost column but only if it's not at the edge.
 * Propagate the color from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) to the last column (m-1) in middle rows, but only for non-zero values.
 * Clear "forbidden" colors in left-side columns (0 to spine-1) of middle rows if those colors appear non-zero in the top or bottom rows from spine to end—this prevents overlap or invalid extensions, but it's easy to miss that forbidden is a set of colors from borders only in right half.
 * Group "specials": these are columns in the top row (from row_color_col+1 to m-2) where the color changes from neighbors (c != left and c != right), indicating starts/ends of patterns; subtlety: group consecutive specials into clusters, and handle singles vs. groups differently (e.g., singles may skip centers under conditions, groups of 2 get extra 3-wide fills in adjacent rows).
 * For filling: Use "homes" (middle rows with the special's color in row_color_col) to fill 3-wide horizontal strips (left=max(row_color_col, j-1) to right=min(m-2, j+1)) in those rows and vertically in adjacent rows (±1), but only zeros and avoiding skips for certain cases; for groups >1, treat as expanded fills without center skips, and for glen=2 add extra 3-wide in adj rows for the second.
 * Subtlety: Half-point (m//2) influences skipping centers for single specials if the color appears only once right of center; also, homes are filtered by row index <= special column j, suggesting left-to-right propagation bias.
 * Border rows (0 and n-1) should remain mostly unchanged except possibly clearing or matching, but code doesn't alter them much—easy to miss that top/bottom guide but aren't filled into.
 * Edge cases: Grids <3 rows return unchanged; no spine or invalid spine returns copy; non-consecutive specials form separate groups; all-zero columns in specials ignored.
 * General: Preserve all existing non-zeros; fills only to zeros; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; patterns seem to form vertical/horizontal extensions of top-row blobs into middle, like a "shadow" or "support" structure.

    special = []

        c = grid_out[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid_out[0][j - 1] and c != grid_out[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special

def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]

                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(These are useful for detecting and clustering transition points in the top row, essential for targeted filling.)

```python
r_cs = defaultdict(list)
for i in middle_rows:
    c = g_out[i][row_color_col]
    if c != 0:
        r_cs[c].append(i)
```
(This defaultdict collects "homes" per color from the row_color_col, key for selecting rows to fill.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the spine in all training examples (e.g., likely column 4 with color 3 in Train 1), propagates to the last column accurately (e.g., ends with 3/4/7/6 as expected), and clears some forbidden left-side cells (e.g., zeros out many left positions in middle rows).
 * What worked: Grouping specials correctly detects transitions (e.g., in Train 1, specials around columns for 6,4,7,6 changes); basic 3-wide fills for singles and groups partially match, like filling 4/7 blobs in rows 4-7 of Train 1; vertical propagation to adj rows works in places (e.g., row 6 in Train 1 gets 7s).
 * What didn't work: Over-fills or incorrect fills in unexpected places, e.g., in Train 1, top row (row 0) position 1 filled with 4 (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]), and row 11 position 1 also 4 vs 0—suggests unintended border modification or propagation leak; in row 4 of Train 1, position 8 has 4 but expected 0? Wait, actually rows 0-11 generated vs expected show minor diffs like row 4 pos 4:4 vs 4 (match), but overall mismatches in left fills.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 4s in top/bottom left (pos 1), and row 5 pos 17:3 vs expected 3 (match?), but row 9 pos 4:6 vs 6 (match)—diffs mainly in borders and some middle left (e.g., row 3 pos 9:4 vs 0? No, row 3: [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] vs expected same, wait—actually close but says INCORRECT, likely subtle like row 4 pos 8:4 vs 0? Upon close check, generated row 4 has pos 8:4 but expected pos 8:0 in some? No, expected row 4: [0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]—yes, pos 8:4 matches, but perhaps row 0/11 extras are the issue; unknown why borders got filled.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated fills too many 4s/7s in middle, e.g., row 1 pos 9-11:4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0; row 2 pos 10:4 vs 7; row 4 pos 7-12:0,4,4,4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0,5,0,0; row 5 pos 5:5 vs 5 (match), but row 6 pos 9:5 vs 5 (match)—over-filling groups without proper skipping or home filtering; also top row pos 1:5 vs 0.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated top row pos 1:3 vs 0; row 1 pos 7:0 vs 0 (match), but row 2 pos 7:3 vs 3 (match?); row 6 pos 13:6 vs 6 (match), but row 8 pos 0-2:7,7,7 vs 7,7,7 (match)—diffs in left fills like row 0 pos 1:3 vs 0, and some middle like row 3 pos 4:3 vs 3 (match), but row 6 pos 4:6 vs 6; seems extra border fills and incomplete clears (e.g., row 9 pos 1-3:0,0,0 vs 0,0,0).
 * Overall: The filling logic for groups (esp. glen=2 with extra adj fills) over-extends horizontally/vertically, ignoring some zero preservations; skip_center logic doesn't trigger properly (e.g., in Train 1 single 6 at pos 6?); home filtering (ii <= j) may be too restrictive or not applied consistently; no extraction of full "objects" or blobs, so misses holistic shape matching—consider adding a function to validate blob connectivity post-fill.
 * Function find_spine is helpful and seems accurate; find_specials and group_specials are useful but may mis-detect if top row has zeros or plateaus; r_cs is essential for per-color homes but could be enhanced to check vertical consistency; the glen>=3 handling as "non-skipping singles" works partially but leads to fragmented fills; no unhelpful functions, but the complex if-else for groups is brittle—easy to miss that for glen=2, first special gets standard fill but second gets extra adj 3-wide, which overfills in Train 2.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits issues from the training failures: e.g., top row (row 0) has pos 1:1 vs likely expected 0 (similar to Train 1/2/3 border overfills); row 12 pos 1:7 vs probably 0; row 14 has many 9s in right but left pos 6-19 overfilled with 9s where patterns like 1-blob or 3/4/6 should be sparser.
 * Middle rows show partial propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3s around pos 5-11, matching a potential 3-blob; row 7-9 have 4s in pos 13-16, good for a 4-group), but overfills like row 3 pos 6-9:1,1,1,1 vs likely narrower (expected might zero some based on top 1 at pos 7); row 10 pos 14-16:6,6,6 good, but row 5 pos 10:3 vs possibly 0 if not a home.
 * Right column (pos 19) consistently filled with 9/1/3/4/6/9 as per propagation, which makes sense if spine is col 4 (3s), but left clears are incomplete (e.g., row 2 pos 7:1 but if 1 forbidden from top, should be 0); vertical fills in adj rows seem spotty, e.g., row 7 pos 5:4 but row 6/8 pos 5:3/0 mismatch.
 * Overall, it partially forms blobs (e.g., 9s in rows 1-2,5,11-14 right-side), but extras like row 14 pos 6:8 (from top?) and missing sparsity in 1/3 areas suggest wrong special grouping or skip logic—does not match expected holistic patterns, likely needs better forbidden application and group handling to avoid dense overfills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero cells (empty spaces) with appropriate color numbers based on patterns, symmetries, and propagation rules across rows and columns, likely simulating object placement or contour filling in a 2D scene with top/bottom borders and middle "body" rows that extend or match colors from a central "spine" structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that act as fixed borders or outlines, while middle rows (1 to n-2) are where most filling/propagation occurs, often mirroring or extending patterns from these borders without overwriting non-zero cells.
 * Identify a "spine" column (or near it) in middle rows where a single consistent non-zero color dominates vertically; this serves as an anchor for horizontal propagation to the right (e.g., filling the last column with the spine's color) and vertical influences.
 * "Forbidden" colors are collected from top/bottom rows to the right of the spine and used to clear conflicting colors to the left of the spine in middle rows, ensuring no bleed-over from border patterns.
 * "Special" columns are isolated non-zero cells in the top row that differ from immediate neighbors (e.g., peaks or isolated features); these trigger targeted filling in middle rows for matching colors, often limited to homes (rows) associated with that color and propagating horizontally within bounds (e.g., j-1 to j+1, but adjusted near edges) and vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Color "homes" are middle rows grouped by their color in a key column (spine+1), and filling for specials is restricted to homes "below" or at the special's position (e.g., ii <= j), suggesting a downward or positional hierarchy.
 * Propagation is conservative: only fill zeros, avoid overwriting existing non-zeros, and respect grid edges (e.g., no filling beyond m-2 or before spine+1 in some cases); vertical propagation is limited to immediate adjacent rows (dr = -1,1) and only if target is zero.
 * Subtleties: Spine detection prioritizes columns with the most consistent non-zero color in middle rows, falling back to any uniform non-zero; specials skip edge cases (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2). Filling for specials may need to extend further right/left in some cases (e.g., for wider objects like the 7s in train1 row5/6/7). Edge handling is critical near m-3 or later, where left bounds shift rightward. No filling if n<3. Patterns suggest symmetry or object completion (e.g., filling blobs like 7s horizontally across multiple columns if aligned).
 * Across attempts, over-filling or under-filling occurs: e.g., missing horizontal extensions for colors like 7 in train1 (row5 col11=7 expected but 0 generated), incorrect vertical fills (train3 row6 col12=0 expected but 6 generated), or misplaced propagations (train2 row4 col7=0 expected but 4 generated). Test grid shows complex interactions with multiple colors (3,9,1,4,6,7,8) and potential multi-spine or irregular objects.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies spines in simple cases (e.g., col4 with color 3 in train1/2/3 middles) and propagates last-column fills accurately (e.g., all 3s in train1 middles col17).
 * What worked: Clearing forbidden colors left of spine (e.g., train1 row1-11 col0-3 cleared to 0 where conflicting); basic home grouping by color in row_color_col (spine+1); vertical propagation for specials in adjacent rows if zero (e.g., train3 row7 col11=6 from row6).
 * What didn't work: Under-fills horizontal extensions for specials (train1 row5 col12=0 generated but 7 expected; train1 row7 col9-11=7,7,7 expected but partial/missing); over-fills or misplaces in specials (train2 row4 col7=4 generated but 0 expected; train2 row2 col10=4 generated but 7 expected); incorrect spine fallback or special bounds (train3 row6 col12=6 generated but 0 expected, possibly from over-propagation of 6 homes).
 * Train1: Generated misses 7s in row5 col12, row7 col9-10 (under-fill blob); row3 col17=3 correct but row4 col17=4 expected (wrong last-col prop for color4 row); row8 col9=0 generated but 7 expected (missed vertical from row7).
 * Train2: Generated over-fills row1 col9-10=4,4 but expected 0,0; row2 col10=4 but 7 expected (wrong color prop); row4 col7=4 but 0 expected; row5 col9=4 but 5 expected (misplaced 5); row6 col13-14=0,0 but expected 0,0 correct, but overall pattern mismatches border extensions.
 * Train3: Generated row6 col12=6 but 0 expected (over-fill right of 6); row6 col10=0 but 6 expected (under-fill 6 blob); row7 col12=6 but 0 expected (vertical over-prop).
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; current program lacks blob detection (e.g., connected components for colors like 7s or 4s) which could help complete shapes.
 * Function `program` overall is a good skeleton (copies grid, handles n<3) but broken in special filling bounds/logic (e.g., l/r ranges too narrow, ignores wider objects); find_spine helpful but may pick wrong col if ties; find_specials useful but misses if specials in bottom row or non-top.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., consistent 3s in col4 middles as potential spine, last-col fills like 9s/3s/4s/6s match row colors in col5; some clearings left of col4 to 0s; vertical fills like row7 col19=3 from row6) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Issues: Under-fills apparent blobs, e.g., row6 col5=3, col9=3, col10=3, col11=3 but col12=0 (likely needs horizontal extension to match expected 3 blob from border); row7 col14-16=4,4,4 correct but row8 col14-16=4,4,4 overwrites? Wait, generated has them as 4s but if forbidden, should clear—unclear without rules, but pattern suggests row8 col10=0 should fill to 3? from row7 col10=3.
 * Over-fills or misses: row3 col5-9=1,1,1,1,0 but top has 1 at col7, suggests special at col7=1, but generated row3 col9=0 (under-fill right); row12 col1=7 but top/middle suggest 7s in left cols, possibly forbidden clear missed; row13 col19=9 correct but row11 col19=9 from prop, yet row10 col17=0 but expected 6 extension from row9 col15-17=4,6,6? (wait, color mismatch).
 * Test has irregular features (e.g., 8s in row13-14 col2-3, 7s in row12 col1/3, multiple 9 blobs in top/bottom), so output misses completing 9s in middles (e.g., row1-2 col5=9 but col6=0 generated, likely needs fill); 1 in row3 col7 propagates poorly (only row3 col5-8=1s, but row12 col5=1 suggests vertical but not filled). Does not account for potential multi-specials or color-specific widths (e.g., 6 in row9 col15-17 needs wider prop than 1-col).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with numbers representing colors and 0s as empty cells) needs to be completed by propagating colors from top/bottom rows into middle rows based on structural patterns like vertical "spines" (consistent color columns), horizontal "special" positions in the top row (unique colors differing from neighbors), and grouping/processing rules to fill shapes or connections without overwriting existing cells or violating forbidden color rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns; top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows provide pattern templates that propagate downward into middle rows (1 to n-2), but only where cells are 0; existing non-zero cells must be respected.
 * Identify a "spine" as a column j where middle rows have the most consistent non-zero color (all same and non-zero); use the next column (j+1) as a "row_color_col" for vertical propagation to the right edge (column m-1).
 * "Forbidden" colors are those appearing in top/bottom rows from the spine onward; clear them from middle rows left of the spine to avoid conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color is non-zero and differs from both immediate neighbors (j-1 and j+1); these trigger horizontal or vertical fillings.
 * Group consecutive specials into clusters; single specials or non-pairs fill horizontally around them in qualifying middle rows (rows with matching color at row_color_col, and row index <= max special column), but skip centers conditionally (e.g., if top row has <2 of that color and not at grid center).
 * For pairs of consecutive specials (glen==2), apply special filling: propagate downward with gaps, fill adjacent cells (e.g., +1 column), and handle vertical extensions above/below if zero.
 * Subtleties: Fillings must check bounds (1 <= row <= n-2, etc.); for pairs, ensure exactly one qualifying row per color with specific spacing (e.g., h2 == h1 + 2); near-end specials (j+1 == m-2) avoid certain extensions; center filling (j == m//2) is forced; pairs override some skips.
 * Collect row-color mappings (r_cs) from middle rows at row_color_col for qualifying homes; only fill if exact match in count and position.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation to right edge only if middle row color at row_color_col is non-zero; clear left-side forbidden colors only if they match top/bottom from spine rightward; for non-pairs, horizontal fill range is l = max(row_color_col+1, j-1) to r = min(m-2, j+1), but skip center if conditions met and it was zero, then potentially fill vertically in adjacent rows.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes shape completion (e.g., blobs, lines) without expansion beyond patterns, respecting vertical consistency and horizontal uniqueness.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * process_group: Overly complex and buggy; mishandles pair vs. non-pair logic, leading to overfilling (e.g., extra verticals or horizontals); the skipped_center vertical fill ignores bounds properly but applies too broadly; color_specials defaultdict groups by top color but doesn't validate against expected shapes.
 * The pair-specific logic in main program (after process_group for glen==2): Attempts gap filling (h1+1) and lower extensions (h2+1 with jj range), but conditions like qual_h2[0] == qual_h1[0] + 2 are too rigid and fail when rows aren't exactly spaced; also fills j1+3 which may exceed patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of spine detection, forbidden clearing, and special grouping, but fails on precise filling rules, leading to overfills, underfills, or misplaced colors in all training cases.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly places a 4 at row0 col1 (should be 0, as top row patterns shouldn't propagate left/upward); also minor overfill in row4 col4 (3 instead of 4? but grids match closely otherwise); underfills or skips some vertical extensions in rows 5-7 for color 4/7 blobs; the spine (likely col3=2) propagates correctly to right edge, but specials (e.g., around col5=3, col9=4, col10=7) trigger wrong horizontal ranges, missing expected 0s in some centers.
 * Train 1 mismatches top row integrity for unknown reason (extra 4 at start, possibly from unhandled propagation); bottom row also has extra 4 at col1, symmetric error; process_group fills too many horizontals in non-pair groups, but pair handling (if any) is absent here.
 * Train 2: Generated overfills top/bottom rows with 5 at col1 (expected 0s); underfills row1/8 with 4s instead of patterned 7s at col7/11; row5 has 5s but expected more sparse 5s with 0s; row6 underfills 5s; specials (e.g., col9=5, col11=7) group poorly, leading to missing vertical 7s in rows 1/3/7/9 and horizontal 7s in row1 col7; pair logic (cols 7-8=7s? but top has 4,7,4) fails spacing check, so no gap fills.
 * Train 2 has broken forbidden clearing (allows 5s left of spine); extract-like r_cs works for color 3/4 but not 5/7/8; process_group skips centers incorrectly, filling extras like row2 col14=0 to 7 (expected 0).
 * Train 3: Generated overfills row2 col7=0 to 3 (expected 0, but row3 has 3s); underfills row5 col7=0 (expected 3? no, expected has 3 only in row3); row6 has 6 at col4 but expected vertical 6s sparse; row7 underfills col11=0 to 6 (expected 6); row8 overfills left with 7s at col0-2 (expected full 7s but pattern is horizontal bar); specials (col7=3, col11=6) not filling downward correctly for color 3 in row5.
 * Train 3 mismatches blob shapes for 3/6 (unknown reason, possibly wrong l/r ranges in process_group); pair handling absent, but no pairs here; find_spine likely picks col3=1 correctly, but propagation misses vertical skips.
 * Across attempts: Spine and r_cs collection work well (consistent verticals for main color like 3); grouping specials catches uniques but processing overfills horizontals (e.g., filling beyond j-1 to j+1); pair code is untriggered or buggy (no exact h1/h2 spacing); forbidden set clears left side partially but misses top/bottom symmetries.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overpropagates color 9 vertically in many middle rows (e.g., rows 1-2,5-6,11-12 all have 9 at col5, but expected likely sparser based on top pattern [...,9,9,1,9,...] suggesting 1 as a special interrupt); underfills horizontals for color 1 in row3 (fills 1s at col5-8, but col9+ should be 0 unless grouped); row6 has 3s at col5-9 but top has no 3 special there (top col5=3? wait, top row0 col4=3, but specials start after spine); row13 has 1 at col5 but vertical from top col7=1? inconsistent.
 * Missing vertical extensions for 4/6 in rows 7-8/9-10 (only partial, expected full blobs like in train2); overfills row14 bottom with 9s everywhere rightward, ignoring specials like col6=8, col16=6; spine likely col4=3, row_color_col=5, but propagation to col19=9 everywhere ignores forbidden (top has 1,4,6,8); no pair handling visible (e.g., cols16-17=6,9? not filled as pair); overall, looks like aggressive 9-filling from top patterns without respecting uniqueness or gaps, making shapes blob into unintended merges (e.g., 9s connecting across 1/3 barriers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in missing cells (0s) with colors from a palette, guided by patterns on the borders (top and bottom rows) and consistency rules in the middle rows, such as propagating colors along a central "spine" column and handling isolated or grouped color segments to complete symmetric or matching internal structures. The puzzle emphasizes symmetry, color matching across rows, and avoiding forbidden colors while respecting border-defined "special" positions that trigger inward filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns, with top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) borders providing color clues; middle rows (1 to n-2) start partially filled and need propagation without altering borders.
 * Identify a "spine" as the leftmost column j where middle rows have the maximum number of identical non-zero colors (or all matching if no partial matches); if none, default to no changes.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in borders from the spine column rightward; clear left-of-spine cells in all rows if they match forbidden colors.
 * Copy spine-adjacent colors (row_color_col = min(spine+1, m-1)) to the rightmost column (m-1) in middle rows for endpoint consistency.
 * Propagation from borders: Detect "specials" as positions j > row_color_col where border cell differs from both neighbors (isolated or edged colors); group consecutive specials into clusters.
 * For groups of length 2: Propagate each color vertically to qualified middle rows (based on position constraints like min_i/max_i relative to j) and horizontally to adjacent empty cells, with skips for right-half singles; also fill neighboring rows' same or adjacent columns.
 * For groups >2 or singles: Handle local subsets where color count in group matches border count right of row_color_col; extend fill ranges for end positions; special cases for small singles (glen==1) limit fills to center or left-adjacent in upper/lower rows, avoiding overfill in right half; only propagate if specials exist beyond m//2 for bottom border.
 * Subtle: Directionality (is_top=True for top border uses upward constraints, False for bottom uses downward); avoid filling if count_c[c] ==1 and j > half+1 to prevent overpropagation; r_cs tracks rows per color at row_color_col for qualification.
 * Easy to miss: All fills only to 0 cells; no changes if no spine; border_row param in find_specials allows bottom propagation; qual lists filter rows by positional bounds (e.g., for top: ii <= j, for bottom: n-1-j <= ii).
 * General: Grids may have varying widths (m=14-20); colors are integers 1+; symmetry often mirrored top-bottom; unfilled areas remain 0.
 * Considerations across attempts: Propagation can overfill (e.g., placing colors where expected 0) or underfill (missing chains); group handling fails on non-consecutive specials; spine detection may pick wrong column if partial matches tie.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in propagation logic, especially for group handling and positional constraints.
 * Train 1: Overfilled row 8 col5 with 6 (generated [...,3,6,0,...] vs expected [...,3,0,0,...]); underfilled row 9 cols5-17 with 6 chain missing (generated partial 6s vs expected single 6 at col5 and col17); row 6 has 7 at col5 but expected 0 there? Wait, no—row 6 generated [0,0,0,2,7,0,...] matches expected, but overall mismatches in 6 and 7 blobs suggest wrong qual filtering or skip logic.
 * Train 2: Underfilled row 2 cols9-12 with 7s missing one (generated [...,7,0,7,7,0,7] vs expected [...,0,7,7,7,0,7]? Wait, expected has 7 at col9); overfilled row 6 col9 with 5 (generated [...,5,0,7,...] vs expected [...,0,7,...]—unknown why, possibly erroneous single-group fill); row 8 matches top but bottom propagation failed symmetrically.
 * Train 3: Underfilled row 2 col6 with 0 (generated [...,2,0,3,0,...] vs expected [...,2,0,0,3,...]—shifted 3 placement); row 6 has 6 at col13 missing (generated [...,0,0,0,6,0,2] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6]); row 6 col4=6 matches but chain incomplete; suggests issues in left-end/right-end extensions for glen>2 and single fills in right half.
 * Spine detection worked in all (e.g., col3=1 or 2 consistent), forbidden clearing partial (left cols zeroed correctly), but propagation over/underfills due to qual bounds (e.g., min_i/max_i too restrictive) or do_skip misapplied.
 * find_specials and group_specials are helpful for border analysis but may miss non-consecutive edges if neighbors match indirectly; r_cs defaultdict for color-row mapping is essential for targeted fills.
 * The main program(g) structure is solid (copy grid, apply spine/forbidden, then propagate top/bottom), but propagate_from_border is overly complex and buggy in group cases (e.g., local_js subsetting ignores some colors; upper/lower fills inconsistent for small singles).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem puzzle-relevant, though the all-matching fallback in find_spine may be too greedy (picks first, not max).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially matches expected patterns but appears incorrect overall, as it underfills several areas: e.g., row 6 has 3-chain at cols9-11 but expected likely extends to col4 or mirrors top 1-chain; row 7 has 4-chain at cols13-15 but misses potential left extension or 0s; row 9 has isolated 6s but no connecting fills, suggesting incomplete single-group propagation.
 * Overfills evident in row 12 col1=7 (possibly forbidden leak) and row 14 cols16-19 with 9s where borders suggest sparsity; rightmost col19 consistently 9 or matching, which seems correct, but middle row12 has 1-chain at cols5-8 matching top but bottom row13/14 have mismatched 8/9 intrusions.
 * Does not look fully correct—lacks symmetry (e.g., top row2 col6=1 not mirrored in bottom equivalents); 4 and 6 in lower middle (rows7-10) seem truncated vs border clues (row0 has 4 at col14,6 at col15); likely misses key considerations like half=m//2=10 skips for right-half specials, leading to sparse right side.
 * To handle test: Ensure qual for bottom uses correct n-1-j bounds; extend r for left_ends properly; account for larger m=20 with more groups.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero-valued cells with colors propagated from a central "spine" column (identified by uniform non-zero colors in middle rows) based on patterns in the top and bottom border rows, following rules for special columns, groups of adjacent specials, and forbidden color clearances. The propagation involves filling horizontal and vertical adjacent zeros in qualified middle rows, with variations for single specials, pairs, or larger groups, while respecting borders and color counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column where middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) share the same non-zero color, maximizing the count of such matches; if none, fall back to uniform color check.
 * Special columns are non-zero cells in the border row (top or bottom) that differ from both immediate neighbors, starting from right of the spine+1 to m-2.
 * Group consecutive special columns into clusters; treat singles with basic horizontal/vertical fill in qualified rows (rows with the special's color in the spine+1 column, within distance constraints), pairs with enhanced filling including extra horizontals in adjacent rows for the second special, triples as two singles (first and last), and larger groups as individual singles.
 * Clear forbidden colors (from border non-zeros right of spine) in all rows left of the spine to prevent invalid overlaps.
 * Set the last column in middle rows to match the spine+1 column's color.
 * Qualified rows for propagation are limited by distance from the special column (e.g., row i <= j for top border) and must have the propagating color in the spine+1 column.
 * Skip certain fills if the special is right of grid half and its color appears only once in the border right of spine.
 * Handle top and bottom borders separately with mirrored logic (e.g., row constraints flip for bottom).
 * Subtle: Propagation only fills zeros and doesn't overwrite non-zeros; vertical fills are only to immediate adjacent rows; horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of special but starting from spine+1.
 * Border=0 for top, border=n-1 for bottom; avoid filling borders themselves.
 * If no spine or spine+1 out of bounds, return unchanged grid.
 * Grids are n rows by m columns, assume rectangular and n>=3 for processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided correctly identifies the spine and specials, groups them, and applies basic propagation rules, which worked for training example 3 (full match, indicating core logic handles some cases well).
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Overfilled horizontals for color 6 in row 9 (generated [...,6,6,6,6,...] vs expected [...,6,0,0,0,...]), likely due to incorrect range expansion or missing skip logic for right-half singles; also filled row 8 col 6 with 6 (generated has 6 vs expected 0), suggesting vertical propagation overreached; row 5 col 7-8 filled with 7 (generated 7,7 vs expected 0,0? wait, expected row 5 is [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,7,7,0,...] so partial match but extras); forbidden clearing worked as left side is zeroed properly.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Overfilled 4's in multiple rows (e.g., row 1 generated [...,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [...,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4], filling where zeros should remain); row 4 generated fills 4's in cols 7-10 vs expected zeros except 5 in col 9; row 6 generated [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,4,0,5,0,0,0,5] but expected [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5] (extra 4 in col 8); suggests pair handling overpropagates horizontals without checking overlaps or qual rows strictly; bottom propagation mismatched 7's in row 7 (generated partial but extras).
 * Spine detection worked in all (e.g., col 4 as spine in ex1 with color 3); forbidden clearing effective in ex1 (left cols zeroed); last col setting correct.
 * do_pair function adds extra horizontals for second special, which helped ex3 but caused overfill in ex1/ex2 (e.g., unnecessary adj row fills); do_single's skip for half+ and count==1 prevented some but not all overfills.
 * group_specials correctly clusters but triple handling (as two singles) may miss middle interactions.
 * Overall, propagation ranges (l=max(row_color_col+1, j-1), r=min(m-2,j+1)) are too broad for some colors, leading to fills beyond intended blobs; qual row filtering by distance (i<=j for top) works but may need tighter bounds.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs attempted; code assumes propagation without verifying connected components post-fill, which could help debug overfills.
 * The program returns unchanged if n<3 or no spine, which is a good edge case handle.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills based on spine (likely col 4 with color 3), propagating 9's, 1's, 4's, 6's from top/bottom specials, but appears overfilled: e.g., row 3 has [...,3,1,1,1,1,0,...] suggesting horizontal fill for 1's expanded to 4 cells, but mentally applying rules (special at col7=1 differing from 9's?), qual rows for 1 might be limited, expected probably [...,3,1,0,1,0,...] or less to match sparse pattern; row 6 has [...,3,9,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] with isolated 3's, but generated fills vertical 9's adj but skips some, looks plausible but row 12 [...,3,9,1,1,1,0,...] overfills 1's horizontally like ex1 error.
 * Fills in row 7 [...,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,...] create a 3-block, which makes sense for group propagation, but row 10 [...,3,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6,6,0,...] has partial 6's; expected likely more restrained, e.g., no full horizontals unless pair.
 * Bottom rows (13-14) have 1's and 9's filled, but row 14 [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems to propagate 9's rightward excessively from col7=8 special? (differs from 9's), but 8 not propagated, looks incorrect as it blends 1/9 without clear qual rows.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: overfills horizontals for 1's and 9's similar to training errors, missing sparse isolation (e.g., row 3 should have fewer 1's); vertical fills seem right (e.g., 6's in rows 9-10), but lacks checks for color conflicts or blob connectivity; to fix, tighten horizontal ranges or add post-fill validation against border patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where numbers represent colors in a 2D grid, and the objective is to fill in zero-valued (empty) cells by propagating colors from a central "spine" column (identified by consistent non-zero colors in middle rows) and top/bottom rows, while respecting forbidden colors on the left side and handling "special" isolated color positions in the top row to extend patterns horizontally and vertically in a structured way. The process involves symmetry-like filling, avoiding overwrites, and conditional extensions based on counts and positions to complete symmetric or patterned objects across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column as the leftmost column (j) where middle rows (1 to n-2) have the maximum number of identical non-zero colors; if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * Use the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col = spine + 1) as a propagation source: copy its colors from middle rows to the last column (m-1) if non-zero.
 * Forbid colors appearing in the top/bottom rows to the right of the spine (from j=spine to m-1) from being placed in any left-side positions (j < spine) across all rows, setting them to 0 if present.
 * "Special" positions are isolated non-zero colors in the top row (row 0) starting after row_color_col, where the color differs from both immediate left and right neighbors (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2).
 * For each special j, propagate its color c horizontally in qualifying middle rows (those with c in row_color_col and row index <= j) to empty cells in a small window (j-1 to j+1, clamped to row_color_col+1 to m-2), but skip the center j if j > m//2 and c appears only once in the top row post-row_color_col.
 * Also propagate vertically from those qualifying rows to adjacent middle rows (ii +/-1) at column j if empty, and then horizontally in that adjacent row's window if still empty.
 * Handle consecutive specials (adjacent j1, j2): if both have matching row counts to their top-row special counts, propagate c2 horizontally in adjacent rows of qual2 (rows <= j2 with c2) but only vertically-adjacent expansions, without the center skip logic.
 * Subtlety: Propagation only to zeros, no overwrites; middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; if no specials, stop after basic spine and forbid steps.
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; empty grid unchanged; spine must be < m-1; if spine invalid, return original.
 * Counts like len(r_cs[c]) must match num_specials_c[c] (top-row specials of c) for propagation; qual lists filter by row <= j.
 * Potential misses: Over-propagation in dense areas (e.g., filling unintended blobs); incorrect spine selection if multiple candidates; ignoring half-grid skip for right-side uniques; not handling non-consecutive specials fully; forbidden colors applied too broadly or not at all in left clears.
 * Visual symmetry: Fillings often create mirrored or extended "objects" (connected same-color regions) from top/bottom hints, but only in middle rows via spine; top/bottom rows unchanged.
 * Zero-handling: Zeros in spine or row_color_col skip propagation; non_zero_colors filter ignores zeros for spine uniformity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided; it correctly handles basic spine detection, forbidden color clearing on left, and last-column copying for training examples 2 and 3.
 * Failed on training example 1: Generated output is nearly identical to expected, but marked INCORRECT—possible subtle difference in a single cell (e.g., row 7, column 10: generated has 7 where expected might differ, or row 4 column 8: 4 vs potential 0; exact diff unknown but confirms over- or under-filling in special propagation).
 * Worked for training 2 and 3: Full correct outputs (not shown, but stated), likely due to proper special handling and no consecutive specials or half-skip issues.
 * Spine fallback logic helped in cases without max-count uniformity.
 * Special propagation with qual filtering and window clamping worked well for isolated cases but may overfill in consecutive specials (as in the partial handling at end of program).
 * Forbidden set application cleared left correctly but might be too aggressive if top/bottom have left-side colors matching right forbids.
 * The consecutive special block at the end is under-developed: it propagates only for c2 in adjacent rows horizontally, but misses symmetric vertical for c1 or full window for both; this could cause misses in train1.
 * r_cs defaultdict and counters (count_c, num_specials_c) are essential for count-matching but may fail if specials overlap colors incorrectly.
 * No extract_objects function; code focuses on procedural filling rather than object detection— this is appropriate as puzzle seems rule-based propagation, not blob extraction.
 * The do_skip logic (for right-half uniques) prevents overfilling but might skip needed centers in some symmetries.
 * Overall, program structure is solid but brittle to special configurations; no handling for bottom-row specials or asymmetric grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies a spine (likely column 4 with 3s in many middle rows), copies 3/1/4/6/9 variants to last column (19), clears left side (columns 0-3) mostly to 0 except preserved 7s/3s, and attempts special propagation (e.g., filling around column 5's 9/1/3/4/6, creating small horizontal extensions like row 6: 3s at 9-10, row 9: 6 at 14).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Under-filling evident, e.g., row 6 has 3,3,3 at columns 9-11 but no vertical extension to row 5/7 at those columns (row 5/7 remain 0 there); row 12 has 7s at 1/3 but no propagation rightward despite potential special at column 5 (1); large top-row 9-runs (e.g., columns 5-7,9-10,12-13,16-18) suggest multiple specials or consecutives, but output misses filling middle rows like row 4/8/10/11 with 9s in windows around them (e.g., row 4 column 5 is 9 but no horizontal to 6-7). Bottom row (14) has fillings like 9s at end but top-like pattern not symmetrically propagated.
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Expected likely has more connected 9-blobs in middle (e.g., filling row 2/3/5 columns 5-7 with 9s from top specials), vertical stacks for 1 at column 5 (rows 3/12 have 1, but no fill between), and 6 extensions in row 9/10 without gaps; generated stops short on vertical/horizontal for consecutives, leaving isolated 0s (e.g., row 7 column 9=0 should be 3?); also, row 13 column 2=7 preserved but may need clearing if forbidden.
 * Test has 15 rows (n=15, m=20), middle_rows=1-13; specials likely at columns 5(9? but neighbors 3,9—wait, top: col4=3,col5=9,col6=9 so not isolated), actually isolates might be col7=1 (neighbors 9,9? wait top row: col5=3? Wait, test input top: [0,0,0,0,3,9,9,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,8,9] so specials e.g. col7=1 (9 left,9 right? no diff), col10=3 (9l,9r no), col14=4 (9l,6r yes), col15=6 (4l,9r yes), col18=8 (9l,9r no); so specials at 14,15—consecutive, but output fills row9 col14=6 but not more vertical/horizontal for 4/6 in qual rows.
 * To handle test: Enhance consecutive logic to bidirectional propagation, add bottom-row special detection, ensure qual includes more rows if counts match loosely; current output misses ~20-30% of expected fills based on pattern symmetry.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by prioritizing maximum uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with a fallback for any uniform column; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by numbers, with 0 as empty) where the goal is to fill in empty cells (zeros) based on propagation rules from a central "spine" column in the middle rows, while respecting forbidden colors from the top and bottom borders, and specially handling isolated or grouped unique colors in the top row to extend them downward and sideways into empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The spine is a column (often around the middle) that must have the most uniform non-zero color across middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in the top or bottom row to the right of the spine; these must be cleared (set to 0) from all positions left of the spine across the entire grid to prevent invalid propagation.
 * After identifying the spine, propagate its color (from row_color_col = spine + 1) to the rightmost column in all middle rows where it's non-zero.
 * Special "potential" columns are isolated top-row colors (non-zero, different from left and right neighbors) to the right of row_color_col; group consecutive ones and handle singles (fill adjacent empties in qualifying middle rows) or pairs (similar but extended vertically) differently, with skips for center positions if isolated and post-half grid.
 * Qualifying rows for propagation are middle rows (1 to n-2) that have the color in row_color_col, but only those <= the special column index for horizontal fills.
 * Horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of the special column (or from row_color_col+1), vertical fills go up/down 1 row from qualifying rows but only into empties, and for pairs, vertical also fills horizontal neighbors in those offset rows.
 * Subtle: For singles post-half grid with count 1, skip filling the center (k==j) to avoid overfill; for groups >2, treat as singles without skip. Ensure no overwriting of non-zeros.
 * Grid edges (rows 0 and n-1, columns 0 and m-1) are borders and not filled in middle propagation; n<3 grids unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only into zeros, not overwriting; r_cs tracks middle rows per color in row_color_col for qualifiers; isol_count tracks how many potentials per color to filter true isolates (those matching total top-right count).

def handle_single(g: List[List[int]], j: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter, skip_center: bool = True):
    c = g[0][j]
    qual = [i for i in r_cs.get(c, []) if i <= j]
    do_skip = skip_center and (j > half) and (count_c[c] == 1)
    l = max(row_color_col + 1, j - 1)
    r = min(m - 2, j + 1)
    for i in qual:
        for k in range(l, r + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0 and not (do_skip and k == j):
                g[i][k] = c
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1 and g[ii][j] == 0:
                g[ii][j] = c
```
(This handles single isolated top colors by filling horizontal/vertical empties in qualifying rows; skip_center prevents overfill in late isolates. Helpful for core filling logic.)

```python
def handle_pair(g: List[List[int]], j1: int, j2: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter):
    c1 = g[0][j1]
    c2 = g[0][j2]
    qual1 = [i for i in r_cs.get(c1, []) if i <= j1]
    l1 = max(row_color_col + 1, j1 - 1)
    r1 = min(m - 2, j1 + 1)
    for i in qual1:
        for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0:
                g[i][k] = c1
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1:
                for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
                    if g[ii][k] == 0:
                        g[ii][k] = c1
    # Similar block for c2, qual2, l2, r2 (omitted for brevity)
```
(This extends single logic to pairs, adding horizontal fill in vertical offsets; useful for grouped cases but note the incomplete vertical check in the provided code snippet—may need fix for g[ii][j2]==0.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly solved all three training examples, indicating strong handling of spine detection, forbidden color clearing, and basic propagation for standard cases.
 * Worked well: Uniform spine finding, grouping consecutives, filtering true isolates via count matching, and limited fills without overwriting.
 * Did not work fully: In the test output, propagation seems incomplete—e.g., row 3 has a run of 1's filled horizontally but no vertical extension below; row 6 has 3's in middle but zeros persist around them without full flood; forbidden clearing left some potential invalid colors (unknown if input had them).
 * Potential overfill or skip issues: do_skip in handle_single prevented center fills post-half, but in test, some late areas (e.g., columns 14-18 with 4,6,9) have partial fills missing adjacent zeros.
 * r_cs qualification (i <= j) may be too restrictive for test, as some middle rows >j have matching colors but aren't used, leaving empties (e.g., lower 9's not propagating up).
 * handle_pair has a bug: vertical dr loop lacks g[ii][j]==0 check (fills unconditionally if in bounds), and the provided code snippet cuts off qual2 handling—likely causes overfill or asymmetry in pairs.
 * Overall, the program understands core structure (spine, isolates, propagation) but misses nuances in vertical extension for pairs and qualifier filtering, leading to underfill in complex test grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., column 4 all 3's propagated from spine; top row isolates like 1 at col7 filled down to row3; 4's and 6's in cols14-17 partially extended horizontally/vertically), which makes sense for basic rules but looks incomplete and incorrect overall.
 * Observed: Many zeros remain in middle/right areas (e.g., rows 2-5, cols6-13 mostly zero except sparse 1's and 9's; row10 has 6's but no fill left/right beyond; bottom rows 12-14 have minimal changes, missing expected propagation from top 9's or 1's).
 * Differences from expected: Expected fuller fills based on patterns (e.g., the 1 in row2 col7 should propagate more vertically/horizontally via qualifiers, but stops abruptly; 8 in row14 col6 and 3's in row14 cols10-11 suggest unpaired fills missing; top-right 9's dominate but don't flood lower empties as in training). It underfills compared to likely complete solution, possibly due to strict i<=j in qualifiers or pair handling bug—e.g., no clear pair grouping visible in output.
 * Does not look fully correct: Leaves isolated zeros in propagate-able areas (e.g., around row7 col19=3, should extend left), and some fills like row3 cols5-9=3,1,1,1,1 seem arbitrary/not matching color source; unknown why bottom row14 mirrors top but with extras like 8,1,9's not cleared if forbidden.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:42:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle solver that operates on a grid of integers representing colors (0 for empty, positive ints for colors), where the goal is to propagate and fill colors based on structural rules like identifying a "spine" column, handling forbidden colors, and processing "special" isolated colors in the top row to fill adjacent areas in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The spine is a column (often near the middle) where middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) share a dominant uniform non-zero color; if no perfect match, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * Propagation starts from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) and extends rightward, including to the last column for middle rows.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows starting from the spine column onward; any occurrence of these in columns left of the spine must be cleared to 0.
 * "Specials" are isolated colors in the top row (different from left and right neighbors, non-zero) between spine+1 and m-2; only "propagatable" specials (where the color's middle-row occurrences match the number of specials of that color) are processed.
 * Specials are grouped into consecutive pairs or singles; pairs trigger broader filling (including diagonal-like extensions to adjacent middle rows), while singles fill locally but skip if near the threshold (halfway point) and unique for the color.
 * Filling for specials targets empty cells (0s) in qualified middle rows (those <= special's column with the matching color in row_color_col), within a ±1 column range, and extends vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Subtleties: Pairs fill more aggressively in adjacent middle rows across their column range; singles have a "do_skip" condition to avoid overfilling late in the grid; all operations preserve existing non-zero cells and only fill 0s.
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; no spine or spine at edge returns unchanged; groups of >2 specials are treated as singles (code only handles 1 or 2 explicitly).
 * Considerations: Uniformity in middle rows for spine detection ignores 0s initially but requires all non-zero to match; propagation doesn't overwrite existing colors; forbidden clearing only applies left of spine.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; trainings 1-3 all passed correctly, indicating the core logic (spine detection, forbidden clearing, basic propagation, and single special handling) works for simpler cases with uniform middle colors and few specials.
 * The fallback spine detection (uniform including 0s if no non-zero match) likely helped in trainings where partial fills exist.
 * Grouping specials into consecutive pairs/singles worked well for trainings, as prop_specials filtering prevented overpropagation.
 * What didn't work: In more complex cases (like test), the pair handling may overfill or miss vertical extensions; do_pair fills adjacent middle rows more broadly but doesn't check for qual rows in the extension loop, potentially filling unrelated areas.
 * The thresh skip in do_single prevented some late fills, which succeeded in trainings but may block needed fills in test if specials are unique but should propagate.
 * No extraction functions for objects like blobs or regions were used; the code focuses on column-based propagation, which is helpful but misses row-wise or blob connectivity rules that might be subtle in the puzzle.
 * r_cs (row colors dict) is essential for qualifying rows but only uses rows <= special column, which assumes left-to-right processing and may miss rightward influences.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 15x20 grid (inferred from rows) with heavy propagation of color 3 in column 4 (likely the spine+1), 9s scattered rightward in middle rows, and some 1s/4s/6s/8s filled locally near specials, but many middle areas remain 0 (e.g., columns 6-19 in most rows have sparse fills).
 * It looks partially correct: Spine seems detected around column 4 (uniform 3s in middle rows there), forbidden clearing left of spine worked (columns 0-3 mostly 0 except some 7s in bottom rows), and top-row specials (e.g., isolated 1 at col7, 8 at col6 in row14? Wait, output is row-wise but jumbled) propagated some locals like 1s in row3 col5/19, 4s in row7/8 col5/19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Expected more comprehensive filling for pairs (e.g., if there are consecutive specials like 9-1-9 patterns in top, should fill wider in middle rows 1-13 columns 6-10+), but output has long 0 stretches (e.g., row1 columns 6-18 all 0 except end 9); vertical extensions seem limited (e.g., row6 has 3 at col10 but no adjacent fill). Also, color 7 in bottom rows (e.g., row12 col1/3) wasn't cleared despite being left of spine, suggesting forbidden logic missed bottom-row specifics or spine misdetected. 6s in row9/10 col14/16 appear filled but isolated without clear special trigger. Overall, underfilled compared to expected full propagation, especially for 9s which dominate top right but don't spread to middle consistently; unknown if due to strict qual row filtering or skip thresh blocking.

[2025-10-01 02:42:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual logic puzzle (similar to a fill-in or pattern propagation puzzle) where the top and bottom rows are fully provided as boundaries or clues, and the task is to fill in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) with colors (integers representing colors) based on rules involving a "spine" column of consistent colors, row-specific color assignments, clearing conflicting areas, propagating from "special" isolated or grouped color changes in the top row, and ensuring symmetry or adjacency rules without modifying the top or bottom rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that must remain unchanged; all modifications are strictly for middle rows (1 to n-2).
 * Identify a "spine" column: Preferably one where middle rows have a single consistent non-zero color; fallback to first constant non-zero column in middle rows. Subtle: If no perfect spine, the fallback may lead to errors if it picks a column that's not truly guiding.
 * Row colors are assigned from a column adjacent to the spine (spine +1), and used row colors are tracked to clear left-of-spine areas in middle rows if they match a used row color (prevents conflicts, but only clears if exactly matching).
 * Last column (m-1) in middle rows is set to the row's assigned color from row_color_col.
 * "Special" positions in top row: Columns j (after row_color_col, before last) where top[j] != 0 and differs from both neighbors (top[j-1] and top[j+1]); these are isolated color "peaks" or starts that propagate downward.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (fill sides and possibly center below if count >=2 in top, plus adjacent row centers), pairs (if each color has exactly one row, fill 3-wide blocks below each, plus adjacent centers and sometimes extra lower full for second, plus common row tweaks if rows are adjacent), and larger groups as singles.
 * Subtleties: Propagation only fills empty (0) cells; conditions like fill_center based on top row count of that color (>=2); for pairs, extra rules only if len(r_cs[c])==1 per color, otherwise fallback to singles; adjacent row fills are only vertical neighbors (dr=-1,1) and only centers; common row handling in pairs only if r1+1 == r2-1, and adds extra side fill.
 * Easy to miss: Spine detection may fail if multiple candidates or none, leading to wrong row_color_col (defaults to 0 if no spine); clearing left only if color in used_row_colors, but doesn't handle zeros or non-used; groups of 2+ may overfill or underfill if not exactly two with single rows each; no handling for bottom row propagation or vertical consistency beyond adjacents; no checks for over-writing existing non-zero cells; top/bottom symmetry isn't enforced beyond copying patterns.
 * Across attempts (this single attempt): Program assumes n>=3, m>=2 but doesn't handle edge cases well; r_cs only tracks non-zero row colors; special detection skips edges and requires both neighbors different (isolated only, no edge specials unless defined); do_single only fills if p >= m//2 (right half only?); pair handling adds asymmetric extras (e.g., "additional lower full for second") which may be puzzle-specific but causes mismatches.
 * General considerations: Colors are positive integers; 0 means empty; puzzle likely requires exact matching of expected filled patterns, so overfilling or wrong propagation breaks it; no diagonal or full vertical fills; potential for multiple spines or no specials leading to minimal changes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it shows partial understanding by correctly identifying spine, row colors, and basic propagation, but fails all trainings due to bugs.
 * Train 1: Correctly filled many middle rows (e.g., row1-3,5,7-10 match expected exactly; last column 3's propagated well; 4's in row4, 7's in row6 correct), but incorrectly modified top row (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]—likely bug in spine/row_color_col causing spillover or copy error, though code claims to skip row0; bottom row also mismatched slightly in positions 1-2 [0,0,0,...] vs generated [0,0,0,...] wait no, bottom matches top expected but top is wrong; row11 generated matches expected bottom but top doesn't—indicates top was altered outside middle_rows logic, unknown reason). Subtle: Clearing left worked for some but left extras like in row0 (shouldn't touch).
 * Train 2: Partially correct fills (e.g., some 4's and 7's in rows 1,3,5,7,9; last column 4/7/5 correct in places), but major mismatches: Overfilled row1 with extra 4's where expected has 0's (e.g., positions 6-7 [0,7] vs generated [4,0? wait no, generated row1 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]—extra 4's in 8-11); row2 generated [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,4,7,7,0,7] vs expected [0,0,0,0,3,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,7,0,7] (extra 4 in pos10, missing 7's); row4 generated [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [0,8,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,4] (wrong 4's instead of 5's/0's; overfill in 7-11); row5 has 5's but wrong positions; top/bottom unchanged correctly, but side rows like row0 bottom part has extras. Unknown why pair/group logic overpropagated 4's instead of isolating 5's/7's.
 * Train 3: Good on some verticals (e.g., last column 2/3/6 correct; 3's in row3; 6's in row6/9), but mismatches: row0 generated [0,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] vs expected [0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,6,2,2] (extra 3 in pos1, missing 0 in pos2—top modified again); row2 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] matches; row7 generated [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2] matches; but row8 [7,7,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] vs expected same (wait, matches?); overall, top altered, and some middle like row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] matches, but clearing left failed to remove extras in places like row0. Specials likely misdetected, causing wrong fills.
 * General issues: Top/bottom modified despite code skipping them (possible indexing bug or print error); spine fallback may pick wrong column (e.g., in train1, perhaps picked col1 with 4's incorrectly); pair handling too aggressive (adds extras like "additional lower full" that don't match expected sparsity); do_single's p < m//2 skip misses left-side puzzles; no validation against overfill; r_cs doesn't handle zero or multi-colors per row.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all extracted parts (spine, specials, groups, r_cs) are potentially useful but need debugging (e.g., do_single's half-grid limit is broken for full grids; pair logic is over-specific and causes mismatches without clear puzzle rule match—avoid until refined).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (15 rows, m=20) does not look correct; it shows partial fills that align with the program's logic (e.g., last column filled with row colors like 9,1,3,4,6; some 3's cleared left of spine; vertical 9's and 4's propagated), but likely overfills or misses based on training failures—e.g., row6 [0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] has a 3-block around col9-11, but expected probably sparser like trainings (e.g., isolated 3's or 0's); row7 [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,4] has 4's in 13-15 but extra 3 in col10 (may be wrong propagation from specials); top row unchanged correctly [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] no, wait printed as row12? The print has 15 lines but starts with [0,1,0,...] which seems like modified top (expected input top probably [0,7,0,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] or similar from context, but generated row0 is [0,1,0,0,...]—altered again); bottom [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems extended but may have extras; misses like row3 [0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] has isolated 1 but no downward prop; overall, looks like spine at col4 (3's), row_color_col=5, but propagation underfilled specials (e.g., top has potential specials around col5=1, col16=6?, but middles sparse); doesn't match training sparsity—e.g., expected likely has more isolated verticals and fewer horizontals; to fix, need better special detection and less aggressive pair fills to handle test's wider grid (m=20) without overpropagating right-half only.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to propagate and fill colors from known positions (often in top/bottom rows and a central "spine" column) into middle rows, following rules for consistency, special isolated colors, and mirroring or extending patterns, while zeroing out invalid or extraneous cells. The program attempts to identify a spine column, clear left areas, propagate colors rightward, and handle special cases, but fails to correctly fill certain blobs or isolated elements in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has top and bottom rows that are "known" or patterned, middle rows that are partially filled and need completion by propagating from the spine or specials, and a consistent color in a central column (spine) across most middle rows to anchor propagation.
 * Zero out everything left of the spine in all rows, but preserve and propagate the spine's color vertically; also zero middle-row cells left of spine if they match known top-row colors (to avoid false positives).
 * Propagate the color from the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col) to the last column in every row, suggesting a "mirroring" or "extension" rule to the right edge.
 * Identify "specials": isolated non-zero colors in the top row that differ from neighbors (starting after row_color_col, up to second-last column), which act as seeds to fill nearby empty cells in middle rows (e.g., adjacent columns and rows) with that color, but skip certain centers and only fill if the special is in the right half.
 * Collect middle-row colors at row_color_col into groups (r_cs) by color, then use sorted "homes" (rows with that color) to fill around specials only if the special's color has matching homes; this implies a matching or pairing rule between top specials and middle positions.
 * Subtleties: Filling around specials includes horizontal (dk -1,0,1 but skipping center if near end) and vertical (up/down rows at the special column) only into zeros; however, this overfills or underfills blobs (e.g., doesn't extend 7s horizontally in Train 1 row 5/7). Specials must be in the right half (after m//2) to trigger filling, but this skips left-half cases. Propagation to last column happens unconditionally after spine setup, but may overwrite or miss interactions. Grids can have asymmetric left-side fillings (e.g., 8s in Train 2 rows 3-6, or 7s in Train 3 row 8), suggesting rules for left-side or non-spine elements that aren't handled. Middle rows may have pre-existing blobs (e.g., 7s in Train 1) that need extension, not just point-fills. Spine detection prioritizes max consistent non-zeros, falling back to first uniform non-zero column, but may pick wrong if ties or zeros interfere. n<3 grids are returned unchanged (edge case handling). Outputs must exactly match expected, including preserving zeros and not over-propagating (e.g., don't fill where expected has zeros).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds column j in middle_rows with most uniform non-zero color (max_count of same color), or first uniform non-zero if none.
    # Helpful for identifying central propagation anchor, but may need refinement for ties or partial uniformity.
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    # Identifies isolated colors in top row (differs from left/right neighbors) after row_color_col, up to m-2.
    # Useful for detecting seed points to fill middle rows, but limited to post-spine and may miss left or end cases.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies a spine (e.g., column 4 with color 3 in Train 1, as both generated and expected have consistent 3s there) and zeros left of it properly across all rows.
 * It propagates spine color vertically and clears conflicting left-middle cells using known top colors, which works in Train 1 (e.g., zeros out extras left of spine).
 * Row_color_col (spine+1) to last column propagation works partially (e.g., 3/4/7 to end in Train 1 rows), but over-propagates in some (e.g., Train 2 fills too many 4s/7s where expected has zeros).
 * Specials detection and filling is partially helpful but buggy: it underfills blobs around specials (e.g., in Train 1, misses extending 7s horizontally in rows 5/7 around column 10-11 special; generated has isolated 7s, expected has full [7,7,7]). In Train 3, misses vertical/horizontal extension for 6s and entirely misses left-side 7s in row 8.
 * In Train 1, generated row 5: [...,4,7,0,...] vs expected [...,4,7,7,...] (missing horizontal 7 extension); row 7: [...,0,7,0,...] vs [...,7,7,7,...] (underfills blob); row 11 identical to top/bottom (correct preservation).
 * In Train 2, generated overfills middle rows with 4s/7s (e.g., row 1: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected [...,0,0,0,7,...] with isolated 7 and zeros; row 2: full 7s in 6-8,13 vs expected sparse 7s and zeros); completely misses left-side 8s in rows 3-6/9 (expected has 8s in columns 0-2 staggered, generated all zeros left).
 * In Train 3, generated row 7: [...,6,0,6,6] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6] (matches here, but minor); misses bottom row 8: [0,0,0,1,...] vs expected [7,7,7,1,...] (no left-side 7s filled); row 2 has 3 in column 7 but expected also does (partial match, but overall underfills).
 * r_cs grouping by color at row_color_col and using sorted homes for filling is a good idea for matching top specials to middle positions, but fails when homes don't align perfectly or when specials need broader blob detection (e.g., doesn't extend existing non-zeros).
 * Skip_center logic (for p+1 == m-2) avoids overfilling near end but may prevent necessary fills; right-half only (p >= half) misses left specials (e.g., Train 2/3 left 8s/7s).
 * The full program structure (copy grid, modify in place, return copy) is helpful for non-destructive testing, but the filling loop only targets zeros and doesn't merge with existing same-color cells, leading to fragmented blobs.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this is missing and essential for proper extension—current point-fills don't grow existing groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it underfills middle rows compared to what the pattern suggests (e.g., top/bottom have dense 9s with isolated 1/3/4/6/8, but middles have sparse fillings like isolated 1 in row 3/12, partial 3-blob in row 6, 4/6 in rows 7-10, but misses extensions—e.g., row 6 should likely have more 3s around column 5-9 based on top 3 at col 10, and no left-side elements like in Train 2/3). It propagates 9 to ends correctly in many rows, but over-zeros areas that should blob (e.g., around column 16-18 6s in row 9/10 don't extend left/right fully). Specials like the 1 at col 7 in top seem under-handled (only fills vertically in row 3/12, but expected likely needs horizontal/nearby fills). The 8 at bottom col 18 isn't propagated upward properly, leaving sparse zeros. Overall, it follows the spine logic (likely col 4=3) but fails to grow blobs around specials (e.g., 4 at col 14-16 in bottom should fill more in rows 7-9), similar to training underfills—doesn't account for left-side or asymmetric rules seen in Train 2/3.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-filling puzzle where colors from the top and bottom rows propagate into the middle rows based on patterns, likely forming "objects" or "blobs" guided by a central "spine" column of consistent color, with rules for filling adjacent cells, avoiding forbidden colors, and handling special transition points in the top row. The goal is to complete the grid by filling zeros with appropriate colors while preserving existing non-zero cells and ensuring symmetry or pattern matching across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column in the middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) that has the most consistent non-zero color; if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column—subtlety: this spine guides propagation to the rightmost column but only if it's not at the edge.
 * Propagate the color from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) to the last column (m-1) in middle rows, but only for non-zero values.
 * Clear "forbidden" colors in left-side columns (0 to spine-1) of middle rows if those colors appear non-zero in the top or bottom rows from spine to end—this prevents overlap or invalid extensions, but it's easy to miss that forbidden is a set of colors from borders only in right half.
 * Group "specials": these are columns in the top row (from row_color_col+1 to m-2) where the color changes from neighbors (c != left and c != right), indicating starts/ends of patterns; subtlety: group consecutive specials into clusters, and handle singles vs. groups differently (e.g., singles may skip centers under conditions, groups of 2 get extra 3-wide fills in adjacent rows).
 * For filling: Use "homes" (middle rows with the special's color in row_color_col) to fill 3-wide horizontal strips (left=max(row_color_col, j-1) to right=min(m-2, j+1)) in those rows and vertically in adjacent rows (±1), but only zeros and avoiding skips for certain cases; for groups >1, treat as expanded fills without center skips, and for glen=2 add extra 3-wide in adj rows for the second.
 * Subtlety: Half-point (m//2) influences skipping centers for single specials if the color appears only once right of center; also, homes are filtered by row index <= special column j, suggesting left-to-right propagation bias.
 * Border rows (0 and n-1) should remain mostly unchanged except possibly clearing or matching, but code doesn't alter them much—easy to miss that top/bottom guide but aren't filled into.
 * Edge cases: Grids <3 rows return unchanged; no spine or invalid spine returns copy; non-consecutive specials form separate groups; all-zero columns in specials ignored.
 * General: Preserve all existing non-zeros; fills only to zeros; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; patterns seem to form vertical/horizontal extensions of top-row blobs into middle, like a "shadow" or "support" structure.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):

                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function is helpful for identifying the guiding spine column based on consistency in middle rows.)

```python
def find_specials(grid_out: List[List[int]], rcc: int, mm: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(rcc + 1, mm - 1):
        c = grid_out[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid_out[0][j - 1] and c != grid_out[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special

def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(These are useful for detecting and clustering transition points in the top row, essential for targeted filling.)

```python
r_cs = defaultdict(list)
for i in middle_rows:
    c = g_out[i][row_color_col]
    if c != 0:
        r_cs[c].append(i)
```
(This defaultdict collects "homes" per color from the row_color_col, key for selecting rows to fill.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the spine in all training examples (e.g., likely column 4 with color 3 in Train 1), propagates to the last column accurately (e.g., ends with 3/4/7/6 as expected), and clears some forbidden left-side cells (e.g., zeros out many left positions in middle rows).
 * What worked: Grouping specials correctly detects transitions (e.g., in Train 1, specials around columns for 6,4,7,6 changes); basic 3-wide fills for singles and groups partially match, like filling 4/7 blobs in rows 4-7 of Train 1; vertical propagation to adj rows works in places (e.g., row 6 in Train 1 gets 7s).
 * What didn't work: Over-fills or incorrect fills in unexpected places, e.g., in Train 1, top row (row 0) position 1 filled with 4 (generated [0,4,0,...] vs expected [0,0,0,...]), and row 11 position 1 also 4 vs 0—suggests unintended border modification or propagation leak; in row 4 of Train 1, position 8 has 4 but expected 0? Wait, actually rows 0-11 generated vs expected show minor diffs like row 4 pos 4:4 vs 4 (match), but overall mismatches in left fills.
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has extra 4s in top/bottom left (pos 1), and row 5 pos 17:3 vs expected 3 (match?), but row 9 pos 4:6 vs 6 (match)—diffs mainly in borders and some middle left (e.g., row 3 pos 9:4 vs 0? No, row 3: [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] vs expected same, wait—actually close but says INCORRECT, likely subtle like row 4 pos 8:4 vs 0? Upon close check, generated row 4 has pos 8:4 but expected pos 8:0 in some? No, expected row 4: [0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]—yes, pos 8:4 matches, but perhaps row 0/11 extras are the issue; unknown why borders got filled.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated fills too many 4s/7s in middle, e.g., row 1 pos 9-11:4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0; row 2 pos 10:4 vs 7; row 4 pos 7-12:0,4,4,4,4,4 vs expected 0,0,0,5,0,0; row 5 pos 5:5 vs 5 (match), but row 6 pos 9:5 vs 5 (match)—over-filling groups without proper skipping or home filtering; also top row pos 1:5 vs 0.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated top row pos 1:3 vs 0; row 1 pos 7:0 vs 0 (match), but row 2 pos 7:3 vs 3 (match?); row 6 pos 13:6 vs 6 (match), but row 8 pos 0-2:7,7,7 vs 7,7,7 (match)—diffs in left fills like row 0 pos 1:3 vs 0, and some middle like row 3 pos 4:3 vs 3 (match), but row 6 pos 4:6 vs 6; seems extra border fills and incomplete clears (e.g., row 9 pos 1-3:0,0,0 vs 0,0,0).
 * Overall: The filling logic for groups (esp. glen=2 with extra adj fills) over-extends horizontally/vertically, ignoring some zero preservations; skip_center logic doesn't trigger properly (e.g., in Train 1 single 6 at pos 6?); home filtering (ii <= j) may be too restrictive or not applied consistently; no extraction of full "objects" or blobs, so misses holistic shape matching—consider adding a function to validate blob connectivity post-fill.
 * Function find_spine is helpful and seems accurate; find_specials and group_specials are useful but may mis-detect if top row has zeros or plateaus; r_cs is essential for per-color homes but could be enhanced to check vertical consistency; the glen>=3 handling as "non-skipping singles" works partially but leads to fragmented fills; no unhelpful functions, but the complex if-else for groups is brittle—easy to miss that for glen=2, first special gets standard fill but second gets extra adj 3-wide, which overfills in Train 2.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits issues from the training failures: e.g., top row (row 0) has pos 1:1 vs likely expected 0 (similar to Train 1/2/3 border overfills); row 12 pos 1:7 vs probably 0; row 14 has many 9s in right but left pos 6-19 overfilled with 9s where patterns like 1-blob or 3/4/6 should be sparser.
 * Middle rows show partial propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3s around pos 5-11, matching a potential 3-blob; row 7-9 have 4s in pos 13-16, good for a 4-group), but overfills like row 3 pos 6-9:1,1,1,1 vs likely narrower (expected might zero some based on top 1 at pos 7); row 10 pos 14-16:6,6,6 good, but row 5 pos 10:3 vs possibly 0 if not a home.
 * Right column (pos 19) consistently filled with 9/1/3/4/6/9 as per propagation, which makes sense if spine is col 4 (3s), but left clears are incomplete (e.g., row 2 pos 7:1 but if 1 forbidden from top, should be 0); vertical fills in adj rows seem spotty, e.g., row 7 pos 5:4 but row 6/8 pos 5:3/0 mismatch.
 * Overall, it partially forms blobs (e.g., 9s in rows 1-2,5,11-14 right-side), but extras like row 14 pos 6:8 (from top?) and missing sparsity in 1/3 areas suggest wrong special grouping or skip logic—does not match expected holistic patterns, likely needs better forbidden application and group handling to avoid dense overfills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero cells (empty spaces) with appropriate color numbers based on patterns, symmetries, and propagation rules across rows and columns, likely simulating object placement or contour filling in a 2D scene with top/bottom borders and middle "body" rows that extend or match colors from a central "spine" structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows that act as fixed borders or outlines, while middle rows (1 to n-2) are where most filling/propagation occurs, often mirroring or extending patterns from these borders without overwriting non-zero cells.
 * Identify a "spine" column (or near it) in middle rows where a single consistent non-zero color dominates vertically; this serves as an anchor for horizontal propagation to the right (e.g., filling the last column with the spine's color) and vertical influences.
 * "Forbidden" colors are collected from top/bottom rows to the right of the spine and used to clear conflicting colors to the left of the spine in middle rows, ensuring no bleed-over from border patterns.
 * "Special" columns are isolated non-zero cells in the top row that differ from immediate neighbors (e.g., peaks or isolated features); these trigger targeted filling in middle rows for matching colors, often limited to homes (rows) associated with that color and propagating horizontally within bounds (e.g., j-1 to j+1, but adjusted near edges) and vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Color "homes" are middle rows grouped by their color in a key column (spine+1), and filling for specials is restricted to homes "below" or at the special's position (e.g., ii <= j), suggesting a downward or positional hierarchy.
 * Propagation is conservative: only fill zeros, avoid overwriting existing non-zeros, and respect grid edges (e.g., no filling beyond m-2 or before spine+1 in some cases); vertical propagation is limited to immediate adjacent rows (dr = -1,1) and only if target is zero.
 * Subtleties: Spine detection prioritizes columns with the most consistent non-zero color in middle rows, falling back to any uniform non-zero; specials skip edge cases (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2). Filling for specials may need to extend further right/left in some cases (e.g., for wider objects like the 7s in train1 row5/6/7). Edge handling is critical near m-3 or later, where left bounds shift rightward. No filling if n<3. Patterns suggest symmetry or object completion (e.g., filling blobs like 7s horizontally across multiple columns if aligned).
 * Across attempts, over-filling or under-filling occurs: e.g., missing horizontal extensions for colors like 7 in train1 (row5 col11=7 expected but 0 generated), incorrect vertical fills (train3 row6 col12=0 expected but 6 generated), or misplaced propagations (train2 row4 col7=0 expected but 4 generated). Test grid shows complex interactions with multiple colors (3,9,1,4,6,7,8) and potential multi-spine or irregular objects.

    special = []

        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies spines in simple cases (e.g., col4 with color 3 in train1/2/3 middles) and propagates last-column fills accurately (e.g., all 3s in train1 middles col17).
 * What worked: Clearing forbidden colors left of spine (e.g., train1 row1-11 col0-3 cleared to 0 where conflicting); basic home grouping by color in row_color_col (spine+1); vertical propagation for specials in adjacent rows if zero (e.g., train3 row7 col11=6 from row6).
 * What didn't work: Under-fills horizontal extensions for specials (train1 row5 col12=0 generated but 7 expected; train1 row7 col9-11=7,7,7 expected but partial/missing); over-fills or misplaces in specials (train2 row4 col7=4 generated but 0 expected; train2 row2 col10=4 generated but 7 expected); incorrect spine fallback or special bounds (train3 row6 col12=6 generated but 0 expected, possibly from over-propagation of 6 homes).
 * Train1: Generated misses 7s in row5 col12, row7 col9-10 (under-fill blob); row3 col17=3 correct but row4 col17=4 expected (wrong last-col prop for color4 row); row8 col9=0 generated but 7 expected (missed vertical from row7).
 * Train2: Generated over-fills row1 col9-10=4,4 but expected 0,0; row2 col10=4 but 7 expected (wrong color prop); row4 col7=4 but 0 expected; row5 col9=4 but 5 expected (misplaced 5); row6 col13-14=0,0 but expected 0,0 correct, but overall pattern mismatches border extensions.
 * Train3: Generated row6 col12=6 but 0 expected (over-fill right of 6); row6 col10=0 but 6 expected (under-fill 6 blob); row7 col12=6 but 0 expected (vertical over-prop).
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; current program lacks blob detection (e.g., connected components for colors like 7s or 4s) which could help complete shapes.
 * Function `program` overall is a good skeleton (copies grid, handles n<3) but broken in special filling bounds/logic (e.g., l/r ranges too narrow, ignores wider objects); find_spine helpful but may pick wrong col if ties; find_specials useful but misses if specials in bottom row or non-top.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., consistent 3s in col4 middles as potential spine, last-col fills like 9s/3s/4s/6s match row colors in col5; some clearings left of col4 to 0s; vertical fills like row7 col19=3 from row6) but does not look fully correct overall.
 * Issues: Under-fills apparent blobs, e.g., row6 col5=3, col9=3, col10=3, col11=3 but col12=0 (likely needs horizontal extension to match expected 3 blob from border); row7 col14-16=4,4,4 correct but row8 col14-16=4,4,4 overwrites? Wait, generated has them as 4s but if forbidden, should clear—unclear without rules, but pattern suggests row8 col10=0 should fill to 3? from row7 col10=3.
 * Over-fills or misses: row3 col5-9=1,1,1,1,0 but top has 1 at col7, suggests special at col7=1, but generated row3 col9=0 (under-fill right); row12 col1=7 but top/middle suggest 7s in left cols, possibly forbidden clear missed; row13 col19=9 correct but row11 col19=9 from prop, yet row10 col17=0 but expected 6 extension from row9 col15-17=4,6,6? (wait, color mismatch).
 * Test has irregular features (e.g., 8s in row13-14 col2-3, 7s in row12 col1/3, multiple 9 blobs in top/bottom), so output misses completing 9s in middles (e.g., row1-2 col5=9 but col6=0 generated, likely needs fill); 1 in row3 col7 propagates poorly (only row3 col5-8=1s, but row12 col5=1 suggests vertical but not filled). Does not account for potential multi-specials or color-specific widths (e.g., 6 in row9 col15-17 needs wider prop than 1-col).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with numbers representing colors and 0s as empty cells) needs to be completed by propagating colors from top/bottom rows into middle rows based on structural patterns like vertical "spines" (consistent color columns), horizontal "special" positions in the top row (unique colors differing from neighbors), and grouping/processing rules to fill shapes or connections without overwriting existing cells or violating forbidden color rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns; top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows provide pattern templates that propagate downward into middle rows (1 to n-2), but only where cells are 0; existing non-zero cells must be respected.
 * Identify a "spine" as a column j where middle rows have the most consistent non-zero color (all same and non-zero); use the next column (j+1) as a "row_color_col" for vertical propagation to the right edge (column m-1).
 * "Forbidden" colors are those appearing in top/bottom rows from the spine onward; clear them from middle rows left of the spine to avoid conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color is non-zero and differs from both immediate neighbors (j-1 and j+1); these trigger horizontal or vertical fillings.
 * Group consecutive specials into clusters; single specials or non-pairs fill horizontally around them in qualifying middle rows (rows with matching color at row_color_col, and row index <= max special column), but skip centers conditionally (e.g., if top row has <2 of that color and not at grid center).
 * For pairs of consecutive specials (glen==2), apply special filling: propagate downward with gaps, fill adjacent cells (e.g., +1 column), and handle vertical extensions above/below if zero.
 * Subtleties: Fillings must check bounds (1 <= row <= n-2, etc.); for pairs, ensure exactly one qualifying row per color with specific spacing (e.g., h2 == h1 + 2); near-end specials (j+1 == m-2) avoid certain extensions; center filling (j == m//2) is forced; pairs override some skips.
 * Collect row-color mappings (r_cs) from middle rows at row_color_col for qualifying homes; only fill if exact match in count and position.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation to right edge only if middle row color at row_color_col is non-zero; clear left-side forbidden colors only if they match top/bottom from spine rightward; for non-pairs, horizontal fill range is l = max(row_color_col+1, j-1) to r = min(m-2, j+1), but skip center if conditions met and it was zero, then potentially fill vertically in adjacent rows.
 * Overall, the puzzle emphasizes shape completion (e.g., blobs, lines) without expansion beyond patterns, respecting vertical consistency and horizontal uniqueness.

```

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * process_group: Overly complex and buggy; mishandles pair vs. non-pair logic, leading to overfilling (e.g., extra verticals or horizontals); the skipped_center vertical fill ignores bounds properly but applies too broadly; color_specials defaultdict groups by top color but doesn't validate against expected shapes.
 * The pair-specific logic in main program (after process_group for glen==2): Attempts gap filling (h1+1) and lower extensions (h2+1 with jj range), but conditions like qual_h2[0] == qual_h1[0] + 2 are too rigid and fail when rows aren't exactly spaced; also fills j1+3 which may exceed patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program shows partial understanding of spine detection, forbidden clearing, and special grouping, but fails on precise filling rules, leading to overfills, underfills, or misplaced colors in all training cases.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly places a 4 at row0 col1 (should be 0, as top row patterns shouldn't propagate left/upward); also minor overfill in row4 col4 (3 instead of 4? but grids match closely otherwise); underfills or skips some vertical extensions in rows 5-7 for color 4/7 blobs; the spine (likely col3=2) propagates correctly to right edge, but specials (e.g., around col5=3, col9=4, col10=7) trigger wrong horizontal ranges, missing expected 0s in some centers.
 * Train 1 mismatches top row integrity for unknown reason (extra 4 at start, possibly from unhandled propagation); bottom row also has extra 4 at col1, symmetric error; process_group fills too many horizontals in non-pair groups, but pair handling (if any) is absent here.
 * Train 2: Generated overfills top/bottom rows with 5 at col1 (expected 0s); underfills row1/8 with 4s instead of patterned 7s at col7/11; row5 has 5s but expected more sparse 5s with 0s; row6 underfills 5s; specials (e.g., col9=5, col11=7) group poorly, leading to missing vertical 7s in rows 1/3/7/9 and horizontal 7s in row1 col7; pair logic (cols 7-8=7s? but top has 4,7,4) fails spacing check, so no gap fills.
 * Train 2 has broken forbidden clearing (allows 5s left of spine); extract-like r_cs works for color 3/4 but not 5/7/8; process_group skips centers incorrectly, filling extras like row2 col14=0 to 7 (expected 0).
 * Train 3: Generated overfills row2 col7=0 to 3 (expected 0, but row3 has 3s); underfills row5 col7=0 (expected 3? no, expected has 3 only in row3); row6 has 6 at col4 but expected vertical 6s sparse; row7 underfills col11=0 to 6 (expected 6); row8 overfills left with 7s at col0-2 (expected full 7s but pattern is horizontal bar); specials (col7=3, col11=6) not filling downward correctly for color 3 in row5.
 * Train 3 mismatches blob shapes for 3/6 (unknown reason, possibly wrong l/r ranges in process_group); pair handling absent, but no pairs here; find_spine likely picks col3=1 correctly, but propagation misses vertical skips.
 * Across attempts: Spine and r_cs collection work well (consistent verticals for main color like 3); grouping specials catches uniques but processing overfills horizontals (e.g., filling beyond j-1 to j+1); pair code is untriggered or buggy (no exact h1/h2 spacing); forbidden set clears left side partially but misses top/bottom symmetries.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overpropagates color 9 vertically in many middle rows (e.g., rows 1-2,5-6,11-12 all have 9 at col5, but expected likely sparser based on top pattern [...,9,9,1,9,...] suggesting 1 as a special interrupt); underfills horizontals for color 1 in row3 (fills 1s at col5-8, but col9+ should be 0 unless grouped); row6 has 3s at col5-9 but top has no 3 special there (top col5=3? wait, top row0 col4=3, but specials start after spine); row13 has 1 at col5 but vertical from top col7=1? inconsistent.
 * Missing vertical extensions for 4/6 in rows 7-8/9-10 (only partial, expected full blobs like in train2); overfills row14 bottom with 9s everywhere rightward, ignoring specials like col6=8, col16=6; spine likely col4=3, row_color_col=5, but propagation to col19=9 everywhere ignores forbidden (top has 1,4,6,8); no pair handling visible (e.g., cols16-17=6,9? not filled as pair); overall, looks like aggressive 9-filling from top patterns without respecting uniqueness or gaps, making shapes blob into unintended merges (e.g., 9s connecting across 1/3 barriers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in missing cells (0s) with colors from a palette, guided by patterns on the borders (top and bottom rows) and consistency rules in the middle rows, such as propagating colors along a central "spine" column and handling isolated or grouped color segments to complete symmetric or matching internal structures. The puzzle emphasizes symmetry, color matching across rows, and avoiding forbidden colors while respecting border-defined "special" positions that trigger inward filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has n rows and m columns, with top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) borders providing color clues; middle rows (1 to n-2) start partially filled and need propagation without altering borders.
 * Identify a "spine" as the leftmost column j where middle rows have the maximum number of identical non-zero colors (or all matching if no partial matches); if none, default to no changes.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in borders from the spine column rightward; clear left-of-spine cells in all rows if they match forbidden colors.
 * Copy spine-adjacent colors (row_color_col = min(spine+1, m-1)) to the rightmost column (m-1) in middle rows for endpoint consistency.
 * Propagation from borders: Detect "specials" as positions j > row_color_col where border cell differs from both neighbors (isolated or edged colors); group consecutive specials into clusters.
 * For groups of length 2: Propagate each color vertically to qualified middle rows (based on position constraints like min_i/max_i relative to j) and horizontally to adjacent empty cells, with skips for right-half singles; also fill neighboring rows' same or adjacent columns.
 * For groups >2 or singles: Handle local subsets where color count in group matches border count right of row_color_col; extend fill ranges for end positions; special cases for small singles (glen==1) limit fills to center or left-adjacent in upper/lower rows, avoiding overfill in right half; only propagate if specials exist beyond m//2 for bottom border.
 * Subtle: Directionality (is_top=True for top border uses upward constraints, False for bottom uses downward); avoid filling if count_c[c] ==1 and j > half+1 to prevent overpropagation; r_cs tracks rows per color at row_color_col for qualification.
 * Easy to miss: All fills only to 0 cells; no changes if no spine; border_row param in find_specials allows bottom propagation; qual lists filter rows by positional bounds (e.g., for top: ii <= j, for bottom: n-1-j <= ii).
 * General: Grids may have varying widths (m=14-20); colors are integers 1+; symmetry often mirrored top-bottom; unfilled areas remain 0.
 * Considerations across attempts: Propagation can overfill (e.g., placing colors where expected 0) or underfill (missing chains); group handling fails on non-consecutive specials; spine detection may pick wrong column if partial matches tie.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core issues in propagation logic, especially for group handling and positional constraints.
 * Train 1: Overfilled row 8 col5 with 6 (generated [...,3,6,0,...] vs expected [...,3,0,0,...]); underfilled row 9 cols5-17 with 6 chain missing (generated partial 6s vs expected single 6 at col5 and col17); row 6 has 7 at col5 but expected 0 there? Wait, no—row 6 generated [0,0,0,2,7,0,...] matches expected, but overall mismatches in 6 and 7 blobs suggest wrong qual filtering or skip logic.
 * Train 2: Underfilled row 2 cols9-12 with 7s missing one (generated [...,7,0,7,7,0,7] vs expected [...,0,7,7,7,0,7]? Wait, expected has 7 at col9); overfilled row 6 col9 with 5 (generated [...,5,0,7,...] vs expected [...,0,7,...]—unknown why, possibly erroneous single-group fill); row 8 matches top but bottom propagation failed symmetrically.
 * Train 3: Underfilled row 2 col6 with 0 (generated [...,2,0,3,0,...] vs expected [...,2,0,0,3,...]—shifted 3 placement); row 6 has 6 at col13 missing (generated [...,0,0,0,6,0,2] vs expected [...,6,0,6,6]); row 6 col4=6 matches but chain incomplete; suggests issues in left-end/right-end extensions for glen>2 and single fills in right half.
 * Spine detection worked in all (e.g., col3=1 or 2 consistent), forbidden clearing partial (left cols zeroed correctly), but propagation over/underfills due to qual bounds (e.g., min_i/max_i too restrictive) or do_skip misapplied.
 * find_specials and group_specials are helpful for border analysis but may miss non-consecutive edges if neighbors match indirectly; r_cs defaultdict for color-row mapping is essential for targeted fills.
 * The main program(g) structure is solid (copy grid, apply spine/forbidden, then propagate top/bottom), but propagate_from_border is overly complex and buggy in group cases (e.g., local_js subsetting ignores some colors; upper/lower fills inconsistent for small singles).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided seem puzzle-relevant, though the all-matching fallback in find_spine may be too greedy (picks first, not max).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially matches expected patterns but appears incorrect overall, as it underfills several areas: e.g., row 6 has 3-chain at cols9-11 but expected likely extends to col4 or mirrors top 1-chain; row 7 has 4-chain at cols13-15 but misses potential left extension or 0s; row 9 has isolated 6s but no connecting fills, suggesting incomplete single-group propagation.
 * Overfills evident in row 12 col1=7 (possibly forbidden leak) and row 14 cols16-19 with 9s where borders suggest sparsity; rightmost col19 consistently 9 or matching, which seems correct, but middle row12 has 1-chain at cols5-8 matching top but bottom row13/14 have mismatched 8/9 intrusions.
 * Does not look fully correct—lacks symmetry (e.g., top row2 col6=1 not mirrored in bottom equivalents); 4 and 6 in lower middle (rows7-10) seem truncated vs border clues (row0 has 4 at col14,6 at col15); likely misses key considerations like half=m//2=10 skips for right-half specials, leading to sparse right side.
 * To handle test: Ensure qual for bottom uses correct n-1-j bounds; extend r for left_ends properly; account for larger m=20 with more groups.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero-valued cells with colors propagated from a central "spine" column (identified by uniform non-zero colors in middle rows) based on patterns in the top and bottom border rows, following rules for special columns, groups of adjacent specials, and forbidden color clearances. The propagation involves filling horizontal and vertical adjacent zeros in qualified middle rows, with variations for single specials, pairs, or larger groups, while respecting borders and color counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column where middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) share the same non-zero color, maximizing the count of such matches; if none, fall back to uniform color check.
 * Special columns are non-zero cells in the border row (top or bottom) that differ from both immediate neighbors, starting from right of the spine+1 to m-2.
 * Group consecutive special columns into clusters; treat singles with basic horizontal/vertical fill in qualified rows (rows with the special's color in the spine+1 column, within distance constraints), pairs with enhanced filling including extra horizontals in adjacent rows for the second special, triples as two singles (first and last), and larger groups as individual singles.
 * Clear forbidden colors (from border non-zeros right of spine) in all rows left of the spine to prevent invalid overlaps.
 * Set the last column in middle rows to match the spine+1 column's color.
 * Qualified rows for propagation are limited by distance from the special column (e.g., row i <= j for top border) and must have the propagating color in the spine+1 column.
 * Skip certain fills if the special is right of grid half and its color appears only once in the border right of spine.
 * Handle top and bottom borders separately with mirrored logic (e.g., row constraints flip for bottom).
 * Subtle: Propagation only fills zeros and doesn't overwrite non-zeros; vertical fills are only to immediate adjacent rows; horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of special but starting from spine+1.
 * Border=0 for top, border=n-1 for bottom; avoid filling borders themselves.
 * If no spine or spine+1 out of bounds, return unchanged grid.
 * Grids are n rows by m columns, assume rectangular and n>=3 for processing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided correctly identifies the spine and specials, groups them, and applies basic propagation rules, which worked for training example 3 (full match, indicating core logic handles some cases well).
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Overfilled horizontals for color 6 in row 9 (generated [...,6,6,6,6,...] vs expected [...,6,0,0,0,...]), likely due to incorrect range expansion or missing skip logic for right-half singles; also filled row 8 col 6 with 6 (generated has 6 vs expected 0), suggesting vertical propagation overreached; row 5 col 7-8 filled with 7 (generated 7,7 vs expected 0,0? wait, expected row 5 is [0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,4,7,7,0,...] so partial match but extras); forbidden clearing worked as left side is zeroed properly.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Overfilled 4's in multiple rows (e.g., row 1 generated [...,3,4,0,7,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected [...,3,4,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,4], filling where zeros should remain); row 4 generated fills 4's in cols 7-10 vs expected zeros except 5 in col 9; row 6 generated [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,4,0,5,0,0,0,5] but expected [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5] (extra 4 in col 8); suggests pair handling overpropagates horizontals without checking overlaps or qual rows strictly; bottom propagation mismatched 7's in row 7 (generated partial but extras).
 * Spine detection worked in all (e.g., col 4 as spine in ex1 with color 3); forbidden clearing effective in ex1 (left cols zeroed); last col setting correct.
 * do_pair function adds extra horizontals for second special, which helped ex3 but caused overfill in ex1/ex2 (e.g., unnecessary adj row fills); do_single's skip for half+ and count==1 prevented some but not all overfills.
 * group_specials correctly clusters but triple handling (as two singles) may miss middle interactions.
 * Overall, propagation ranges (l=max(row_color_col+1, j-1), r=min(m-2,j+1)) are too broad for some colors, leading to fills beyond intended blobs; qual row filtering by distance (i<=j for top) works but may need tighter bounds.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs attempted; code assumes propagation without verifying connected components post-fill, which could help debug overfills.
 * The program returns unchanged if n<3 or no spine, which is a good edge case handle.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills based on spine (likely col 4 with color 3), propagating 9's, 1's, 4's, 6's from top/bottom specials, but appears overfilled: e.g., row 3 has [...,3,1,1,1,1,0,...] suggesting horizontal fill for 1's expanded to 4 cells, but mentally applying rules (special at col7=1 differing from 9's?), qual rows for 1 might be limited, expected probably [...,3,1,0,1,0,...] or less to match sparse pattern; row 6 has [...,3,9,0,0,0,0,3,0,...] with isolated 3's, but generated fills vertical 9's adj but skips some, looks plausible but row 12 [...,3,9,1,1,1,0,...] overfills 1's horizontally like ex1 error.
 * Fills in row 7 [...,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,4,0,...] create a 3-block, which makes sense for group propagation, but row 10 [...,3,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6,6,0,...] has partial 6's; expected likely more restrained, e.g., no full horizontals unless pair.
 * Bottom rows (13-14) have 1's and 9's filled, but row 14 [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] seems to propagate 9's rightward excessively from col7=8 special? (differs from 9's), but 8 not propagated, looks incorrect as it blends 1/9 without clear qual rows.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: overfills horizontals for 1's and 9's similar to training errors, missing sparse isolation (e.g., row 3 should have fewer 1's); vertical fills seem right (e.g., 6's in rows 9-10), but lacks checks for color conflicts or blob connectivity; to fix, tighten horizontal ranges or add post-fill validation against border patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where numbers represent colors in a 2D grid, and the objective is to fill in zero-valued (empty) cells by propagating colors from a central "spine" column (identified by consistent non-zero colors in middle rows) and top/bottom rows, while respecting forbidden colors on the left side and handling "special" isolated color positions in the top row to extend patterns horizontally and vertically in a structured way. The process involves symmetry-like filling, avoiding overwrites, and conditional extensions based on counts and positions to complete symmetric or patterned objects across rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column as the leftmost column (j) where middle rows (1 to n-2) have the maximum number of identical non-zero colors; if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * Use the column immediately right of the spine (row_color_col = spine + 1) as a propagation source: copy its colors from middle rows to the last column (m-1) if non-zero.
 * Forbid colors appearing in the top/bottom rows to the right of the spine (from j=spine to m-1) from being placed in any left-side positions (j < spine) across all rows, setting them to 0 if present.
 * "Special" positions are isolated non-zero colors in the top row (row 0) starting after row_color_col, where the color differs from both immediate left and right neighbors (j from row_color_col+1 to m-2).
 * For each special j, propagate its color c horizontally in qualifying middle rows (those with c in row_color_col and row index <= j) to empty cells in a small window (j-1 to j+1, clamped to row_color_col+1 to m-2), but skip the center j if j > m//2 and c appears only once in the top row post-row_color_col.
 * Also propagate vertically from those qualifying rows to adjacent middle rows (ii +/-1) at column j if empty, and then horizontally in that adjacent row's window if still empty.
 * Handle consecutive specials (adjacent j1, j2): if both have matching row counts to their top-row special counts, propagate c2 horizontally in adjacent rows of qual2 (rows <= j2 with c2) but only vertically-adjacent expansions, without the center skip logic.
 * Subtlety: Propagation only to zeros, no overwrites; middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; if no specials, stop after basic spine and forbid steps.
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; empty grid unchanged; spine must be < m-1; if spine invalid, return original.
 * Counts like len(r_cs[c]) must match num_specials_c[c] (top-row specials of c) for propagation; qual lists filter by row <= j.
 * Potential misses: Over-propagation in dense areas (e.g., filling unintended blobs); incorrect spine selection if multiple candidates; ignoring half-grid skip for right-side uniques; not handling non-consecutive specials fully; forbidden colors applied too broadly or not at all in left clears.
 * Visual symmetry: Fillings often create mirrored or extended "objects" (connected same-color regions) from top/bottom hints, but only in middle rows via spine; top/bottom rows unchanged.
 * Zero-handling: Zeros in spine or row_color_col skip propagation; non_zero_colors filter ignores zeros for spine uniformity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided; it correctly handles basic spine detection, forbidden color clearing on left, and last-column copying for training examples 2 and 3.
 * Failed on training example 1: Generated output is nearly identical to expected, but marked INCORRECT—possible subtle difference in a single cell (e.g., row 7, column 10: generated has 7 where expected might differ, or row 4 column 8: 4 vs potential 0; exact diff unknown but confirms over- or under-filling in special propagation).
 * Worked for training 2 and 3: Full correct outputs (not shown, but stated), likely due to proper special handling and no consecutive specials or half-skip issues.
 * Spine fallback logic helped in cases without max-count uniformity.
 * Special propagation with qual filtering and window clamping worked well for isolated cases but may overfill in consecutive specials (as in the partial handling at end of program).
 * Forbidden set application cleared left correctly but might be too aggressive if top/bottom have left-side colors matching right forbids.
 * The consecutive special block at the end is under-developed: it propagates only for c2 in adjacent rows horizontally, but misses symmetric vertical for c1 or full window for both; this could cause misses in train1.
 * r_cs defaultdict and counters (count_c, num_specials_c) are essential for count-matching but may fail if specials overlap colors incorrectly.
 * No extract_objects function; code focuses on procedural filling rather than object detection— this is appropriate as puzzle seems rule-based propagation, not blob extraction.
 * The do_skip logic (for right-half uniques) prevents overfilling but might skip needed centers in some symmetries.
 * Overall, program structure is solid but brittle to special configurations; no handling for bottom-row specials or asymmetric grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies a spine (likely column 4 with 3s in many middle rows), copies 3/1/4/6/9 variants to last column (19), clears left side (columns 0-3) mostly to 0 except preserved 7s/3s, and attempts special propagation (e.g., filling around column 5's 9/1/3/4/6, creating small horizontal extensions like row 6: 3s at 9-10, row 9: 6 at 14).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Under-filling evident, e.g., row 6 has 3,3,3 at columns 9-11 but no vertical extension to row 5/7 at those columns (row 5/7 remain 0 there); row 12 has 7s at 1/3 but no propagation rightward despite potential special at column 5 (1); large top-row 9-runs (e.g., columns 5-7,9-10,12-13,16-18) suggest multiple specials or consecutives, but output misses filling middle rows like row 4/8/10/11 with 9s in windows around them (e.g., row 4 column 5 is 9 but no horizontal to 6-7). Bottom row (14) has fillings like 9s at end but top-like pattern not symmetrically propagated.
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Expected likely has more connected 9-blobs in middle (e.g., filling row 2/3/5 columns 5-7 with 9s from top specials), vertical stacks for 1 at column 5 (rows 3/12 have 1, but no fill between), and 6 extensions in row 9/10 without gaps; generated stops short on vertical/horizontal for consecutives, leaving isolated 0s (e.g., row 7 column 9=0 should be 3?); also, row 13 column 2=7 preserved but may need clearing if forbidden.
 * Test has 15 rows (n=15, m=20), middle_rows=1-13; specials likely at columns 5(9? but neighbors 3,9—wait, top: col4=3,col5=9,col6=9 so not isolated), actually isolates might be col7=1 (neighbors 9,9? wait top row: col5=3? Wait, test input top: [0,0,0,0,3,9,9,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,8,9] so specials e.g. col7=1 (9 left,9 right? no diff), col10=3 (9l,9r no), col14=4 (9l,6r yes), col15=6 (4l,9r yes), col18=8 (9l,9r no); so specials at 14,15—consecutive, but output fills row9 col14=6 but not more vertical/horizontal for 4/6 in qual rows.
 * To handle test: Enhance consecutive logic to bidirectional propagation, add bottom-row special detection, ensure qual includes more rows if counts match loosely; current output misses ~20-30% of expected fills based on pattern symmetry.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving color propagation and filling rules, where a central "spine" column is identified based on uniform colors in middle rows, forbidden colors are cleared from certain areas, and patterns in the top row (especially "special" isolated or grouped color changes) dictate targeted fillings in middle and adjacent rows to complete symmetric or constrained structures without overfilling or violating boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the spine as the leftmost column with the maximum uniform non-zero color across all middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * After finding the spine, set the last column (m-1) in middle rows to match the color at spine+1 (row_color_col), ensuring end consistency.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from non-zero entries in top and bottom rows starting from the spine column onward; clear any matching non-zero colors to the left of the spine in all rows to prevent conflicts.
 * "Specials" are columns in the top row (starting after row_color_col, up to m-2) where the color differs from both neighbors and is non-zero, indicating points for propagation.
 * Group adjacent specials into clusters; handle singles (glen=1) by filling a 3-column window (j-1 to j+1, bounded by row_color_col and m-2) in matching middle rows (those with the special's color at row_color_col and row index <= special column), skipping the center if near the end; also fill vertically adjacent middle rows at the special column.
 * For pairs (glen=2), fill each independently like singles, but add extra side fillings (j-1 and j+1) in vertically adjacent rows for the second special only.
 * For triples (glen=3), check for symmetry (c1 == c3 != c2) and handle only the middle as a limited fill (sides only, no center, plus vertical adjacents); otherwise, treat as three independent singles with near-end skipping.
 * Longer groups (glen>3) are treated as independent singles with the same rules.
 * Only fill zeros; do not overwrite existing non-zeros.
 * Middle rows are strictly 1 to n-2; top/bottom (0 and n-1) remain unchanged except via forbidden clearing.
 * Near-end specials (j >= m-3) skip center filling in horizontal propagation to avoid overreach.
 * r_cs mapping ensures fillings only propagate to middle rows that already have the special's color at row_color_col, filtered by row index <= special column (suggesting left-to-right progression or ordering).
 * Subtle: In symmetric triples, middle handling is minimal (sides + vertical) to preserve outer symmetry; in pairs, asymmetry in extra side fillings for the second item suggests directional bias (e.g., rightward emphasis).
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; invalid spine (e.g., at or beyond m-1) returns unchanged; empty specials or no matching mains skip processing.
 * Potential overfilling risk: Horizontal windows might fill too broadly if bounds (row_color_col, m-2) are not strictly enforced, or if vertical adjacents overlap with existing fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    spine = -1
    max_count = 0
    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine by prioritizing maximum uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with a fallback for any uniform column; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int) -> List[int]:
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[0][j]
        if c != 0 and c != grid[0][j - 1] and c != grid[0][j + 1]:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```
(This identifies isolated color changes in the top row after the spine+1, excluding edges; essential for detecting propagation points.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This clusters adjacent specials, enabling differentiated handling by group length; key for symmetry and pair-specific rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program worked correctly for Training example 1 and 3, accurately propagating colors without overfilling or missing required structures, matching expected outputs fully.
 * Failed for Training example 2: Generated output overfilled several positions compared to expected, e.g., row 1 has extra 4's at columns 8-11 and 14 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,0,0,4] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]); row 4 has extra 4's at 8-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,7,...]); row 5 has extra 4's at 7-8 and 10-11 (generated: [...,4,4,4,4,4,...] vs expected: [...,0,0,0,5,0,0,...]); row 6 has 5's mismatched in placement; row 7 mirrors row 3 but with overfills in generated. This suggests over-broad horizontal filling in single or group handling, possibly ignoring the row index <= j filter strictly or not skipping near-end centers properly.
 * The r_cs filtering (row <= j) worked in correct cases but may have been bypassed or misapplied in train 2, leading to fillings in rows that shouldn't propagate from later specials.
 * Group handling for glen=2 added extra sides correctly in some cases but contributed to overfills in train 2's pair-like structures.
 * Symmetric triple detection (c1==c3 != c2) was not triggered in train 2 (no such pattern apparent), falling back to singles which caused excess fills.
 * Fallback spine detection was not needed in provided examples but ensures robustness.
 * Forbidden clearing worked across all, as left-side clears match expectations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_spine, find_specials, group_specials) are relevant and built upon effectively, though main program's group processing needs refinement for overfilling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense based on inferred rules: Spine appears correctly identified (likely column 5 with color 9 uniform in middles), last column filled with 9's in middles, forbidden clears applied (e.g., left side has scattered 0's where conflicts might be), and some horizontal/vertical propagations visible (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around column 10, row 7 has 3's and 4's filling sides).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overfilling suspected in rows 2-5 and 11-12 with scattered 0's in top/middle that should propagate more (e.g., row 3 has isolated 1 at column 7 but no adjacent fills, unlike train expectations); row 12 has all 0's post-spine except end 9, missing potential group fills from top row's 9-1-9 pattern (possible triple symmetry not handled minimally); vertical adjacents seem underfilled (e.g., around column 7's 1 in row 3, no neighboring rows filled); near-end (columns 15-19) has partial 4/6/9 but skips centers inconsistently, risking overreach like in train 2. Without expected output, it's unclear if 1's in row 3/13 are correctly isolated or if 7's in bottom-left need more clearing/propagation, but the sparsity post-spine suggests incomplete group processing for longer 9-runs in top row.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by numbers, with 0 as empty) where the goal is to fill in empty cells (zeros) based on propagation rules from a central "spine" column in the middle rows, while respecting forbidden colors from the top and bottom borders, and specially handling isolated or grouped unique colors in the top row to extend them downward and sideways into empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The spine is a column (often around the middle) that must have the most uniform non-zero color across middle rows (rows 1 to n-2); if none, fall back to the first uniform non-zero column.
 * Forbidden colors are those appearing in the top or bottom row to the right of the spine; these must be cleared (set to 0) from all positions left of the spine across the entire grid to prevent invalid propagation.
 * After identifying the spine, propagate its color (from row_color_col = spine + 1) to the rightmost column in all middle rows where it's non-zero.
 * Special "potential" columns are isolated top-row colors (non-zero, different from left and right neighbors) to the right of row_color_col; group consecutive ones and handle singles (fill adjacent empties in qualifying middle rows) or pairs (similar but extended vertically) differently, with skips for center positions if isolated and post-half grid.
 * Qualifying rows for propagation are middle rows (1 to n-2) that have the color in row_color_col, but only those <= the special column index for horizontal fills.
 * Horizontal fills are limited to 1 cell left/right of the special column (or from row_color_col+1), vertical fills go up/down 1 row from qualifying rows but only into empties, and for pairs, vertical also fills horizontal neighbors in those offset rows.
 * Subtle: For singles post-half grid with count 1, skip filling the center (k==j) to avoid overfill; for groups >2, treat as singles without skip. Ensure no overwriting of non-zeros.
 * Grid edges (rows 0 and n-1, columns 0 and m-1) are borders and not filled in middle propagation; n<3 grids unchanged.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation only into zeros, not overwriting; r_cs tracks middle rows per color in row_color_col for qualifiers; isol_count tracks how many potentials per color to filter true isolates (those matching total top-right count).

    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):

                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```
(This function correctly identifies the spine column by maximizing uniform non-zero coverage in middle rows, with fallback; useful for anchoring propagation.)

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```
(This groups consecutive isolated top-row positions, essential for distinguishing single/pair/multi handling.)

```python
def handle_single(g: List[List[int]], j: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter, skip_center: bool = True):
    c = g[0][j]
    qual = [i for i in r_cs.get(c, []) if i <= j]
    do_skip = skip_center and (j > half) and (count_c[c] == 1)
    l = max(row_color_col + 1, j - 1)
    r = min(m - 2, j + 1)
    for i in qual:
        for k in range(l, r + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0 and not (do_skip and k == j):
                g[i][k] = c
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1 and g[ii][j] == 0:
                g[ii][j] = c
```
(This handles single isolated top colors by filling horizontal/vertical empties in qualifying rows; skip_center prevents overfill in late isolates. Helpful for core filling logic.)

```python
def handle_pair(g: List[List[int]], j1: int, j2: int, row_color_col: int, m: int, n: int, r_cs: defaultdict, half: int, count_c: Counter):
    c1 = g[0][j1]
    c2 = g[0][j2]
    qual1 = [i for i in r_cs.get(c1, []) if i <= j1]
    l1 = max(row_color_col + 1, j1 - 1)
    r1 = min(m - 2, j1 + 1)
    for i in qual1:
        for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
            if g[i][k] == 0:
                g[i][k] = c1
        for dr in [-1, 1]:
            ii = i + dr
            if 1 <= ii < n - 1:
                for k in range(l1, r1 + 1):
                    if g[ii][k] == 0:
                        g[ii][k] = c1
    # Similar block for c2, qual2, l2, r2 (omitted for brevity)
```
(This extends single logic to pairs, adding horizontal fill in vertical offsets; useful for grouped cases but note the incomplete vertical check in the provided code snippet—may need fix for g[ii][j2]==0.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly solved all three training examples, indicating strong handling of spine detection, forbidden color clearing, and basic propagation for standard cases.
 * Worked well: Uniform spine finding, grouping consecutives, filtering true isolates via count matching, and limited fills without overwriting.
 * Did not work fully: In the test output, propagation seems incomplete—e.g., row 3 has a run of 1's filled horizontally but no vertical extension below; row 6 has 3's in middle but zeros persist around them without full flood; forbidden clearing left some potential invalid colors (unknown if input had them).
 * Potential overfill or skip issues: do_skip in handle_single prevented center fills post-half, but in test, some late areas (e.g., columns 14-18 with 4,6,9) have partial fills missing adjacent zeros.
 * r_cs qualification (i <= j) may be too restrictive for test, as some middle rows >j have matching colors but aren't used, leaving empties (e.g., lower 9's not propagating up).
 * handle_pair has a bug: vertical dr loop lacks g[ii][j]==0 check (fills unconditionally if in bounds), and the provided code snippet cuts off qual2 handling—likely causes overfill or asymmetry in pairs.
 * Overall, the program understands core structure (spine, isolates, propagation) but misses nuances in vertical extension for pairs and qualifier filtering, leading to underfill in complex test grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid (e.g., column 4 all 3's propagated from spine; top row isolates like 1 at col7 filled down to row3; 4's and 6's in cols14-17 partially extended horizontally/vertically), which makes sense for basic rules but looks incomplete and incorrect overall.
 * Observed: Many zeros remain in middle/right areas (e.g., rows 2-5, cols6-13 mostly zero except sparse 1's and 9's; row10 has 6's but no fill left/right beyond; bottom rows 12-14 have minimal changes, missing expected propagation from top 9's or 1's).
 * Differences from expected: Expected fuller fills based on patterns (e.g., the 1 in row2 col7 should propagate more vertically/horizontally via qualifiers, but stops abruptly; 8 in row14 col6 and 3's in row14 cols10-11 suggest unpaired fills missing; top-right 9's dominate but don't flood lower empties as in training). It underfills compared to likely complete solution, possibly due to strict i<=j in qualifiers or pair handling bug—e.g., no clear pair grouping visible in output.
 * Does not look fully correct: Leaves isolated zeros in propagate-able areas (e.g., around row7 col19=3, should extend left), and some fills like row3 cols5-9=3,1,1,1,1 seem arbitrary/not matching color source; unknown why bottom row14 mirrors top but with extras like 8,1,9's not cleared if forbidden.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle solver that operates on a grid of integers representing colors (0 for empty, positive ints for colors), where the goal is to propagate and fill colors based on structural rules like identifying a "spine" column, handling forbidden colors, and processing "special" isolated colors in the top row to fill adjacent areas in middle rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The spine is a column (often near the middle) where middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) share a dominant uniform non-zero color; if no perfect match, fall back to any uniform non-zero column.
 * Propagation starts from the spine+1 column (row_color_col) and extends rightward, including to the last column for middle rows.
 * Forbidden colors are collected from top (row 0) and bottom (row n-1) rows starting from the spine column onward; any occurrence of these in columns left of the spine must be cleared to 0.
 * "Specials" are isolated colors in the top row (different from left and right neighbors, non-zero) between spine+1 and m-2; only "propagatable" specials (where the color's middle-row occurrences match the number of specials of that color) are processed.
 * Specials are grouped into consecutive pairs or singles; pairs trigger broader filling (including diagonal-like extensions to adjacent middle rows), while singles fill locally but skip if near the threshold (halfway point) and unique for the color.
 * Filling for specials targets empty cells (0s) in qualified middle rows (those <= special's column with the matching color in row_color_col), within a ±1 column range, and extends vertically to adjacent middle rows.
 * Subtleties: Pairs fill more aggressively in adjacent middle rows across their column range; singles have a "do_skip" condition to avoid overfilling late in the grid; all operations preserve existing non-zero cells and only fill 0s.
 * Edge cases: Grids with n<3 return unchanged; no spine or spine at edge returns unchanged; groups of >2 specials are treated as singles (code only handles 1 or 2 explicitly).
 * Considerations: Uniformity in middle rows for spine detection ignores 0s initially but requires all non-zero to match; propagation doesn't overwrite existing colors; forbidden clearing only applies left of spine.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; trainings 1-3 all passed correctly, indicating the core logic (spine detection, forbidden clearing, basic propagation, and single special handling) works for simpler cases with uniform middle colors and few specials.
 * The fallback spine detection (uniform including 0s if no non-zero match) likely helped in trainings where partial fills exist.
 * Grouping specials into consecutive pairs/singles worked well for trainings, as prop_specials filtering prevented overpropagation.
 * What didn't work: In more complex cases (like test), the pair handling may overfill or miss vertical extensions; do_pair fills adjacent middle rows more broadly but doesn't check for qual rows in the extension loop, potentially filling unrelated areas.
 * The thresh skip in do_single prevented some late fills, which succeeded in trainings but may block needed fills in test if specials are unique but should propagate.
 * No extraction functions for objects like blobs or regions were used; the code focuses on column-based propagation, which is helpful but misses row-wise or blob connectivity rules that might be subtle in the puzzle.
 * r_cs (row colors dict) is essential for qualifying rows but only uses rows <= special column, which assumes left-to-right processing and may miss rightward influences.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 15x20 grid (inferred from rows) with heavy propagation of color 3 in column 4 (likely the spine+1), 9s scattered rightward in middle rows, and some 1s/4s/6s/8s filled locally near specials, but many middle areas remain 0 (e.g., columns 6-19 in most rows have sparse fills).
 * It looks partially correct: Spine seems detected around column 4 (uniform 3s in middle rows there), forbidden clearing left of spine worked (columns 0-3 mostly 0 except some 7s in bottom rows), and top-row specials (e.g., isolated 1 at col7, 8 at col6 in row14? Wait, output is row-wise but jumbled) propagated some locals like 1s in row3 col5/19, 4s in row7/8 col5/19.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Expected more comprehensive filling for pairs (e.g., if there are consecutive specials like 9-1-9 patterns in top, should fill wider in middle rows 1-13 columns 6-10+), but output has long 0 stretches (e.g., row1 columns 6-18 all 0 except end 9); vertical extensions seem limited (e.g., row6 has 3 at col10 but no adjacent fill). Also, color 7 in bottom rows (e.g., row12 col1/3) wasn't cleared despite being left of spine, suggesting forbidden logic missed bottom-row specifics or spine misdetected. 6s in row9/10 col14/16 appear filled but isolated without clear special trigger. Overall, underfilled compared to expected full propagation, especially for 9s which dominate top right but don't spread to middle consistently; unknown if due to strict qual row filtering or skip thresh blocking.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:47:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the goal is to fill in zeroed areas by propagating colors from the top and bottom borders through the middle rows, guided by a central "spine" column and special border positions that differ from their neighbors. The filling follows rules for horizontal and vertical propagation, with variations based on groups of consecutive specials, while respecting forbidden colors and ensuring consistency with middle-row patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify a "spine" column as the leftmost column where middle rows (rows 1 to n-2) predominantly share the same non-zero color; if none, fall back to uniform color checks.
 * Special positions on borders (top row 0 or bottom row n-1) are columns j (from spine+1 to m-2) where the border cell differs from both left and right neighbors and is non-zero.
 * Group consecutive specials into clusters; handle singles with optional center-skipping in horizontals if post-half and unique count, pairs with single treatment for first + full for second + extra adjacents, and multiples as singles.
 * Propagate from specials: for qualifying middle rows (based on color matches and position relative to spine/half), fill horizontals (l to r around special, skipping center if flagged) and verticals (up/down if empty).
 * Set last column of middle rows to match the spine+1 column's color if non-zero.
 * Clear forbidden colors (from borders at/after spine) from pre-spine columns across all rows.
 * Validation for specials: only process if the number of middle-row matches for that color equals the count of that color in specials.
 * Subtleties: Directionality differs by border (top uses rows <= j, bottom uses rows >= n-1-j); half-point (m//2) affects skipping; vertical fills are only immediate adjacents; no filling if no qualifying rows; preserve existing non-zeros.
 * Easy to miss: Over-filling horizontals in non-qualifying rows (e.g., no extra adjacents for singles); incorrect spine detection leading to wrong row_color_col; ignoring zero borders or non-consecutive groups; propagating to already-filled cells; asymmetry between top/bottom processing.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure r_cs (row-to-color mapping) is built post-forbidden clearing and only from middle rows at row_color_col; handle cases where spine is near edges (e.g., >= m-1 skips); no diagonal or multi-step propagation, only direct horizontal/vertical; test for uniform middle colors vs. non-zero dominant.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def find_spine(grid: List[List[int]], middle_rows: List[int], m: int) -> int:
    # Finds dominant uniform non-zero column in middle rows, with fallback to first uniform non-zero.
    spine = -1

    for j in range(m):
        colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
        non_zero_colors = [col for col in colors if col != 0]
        if non_zero_colors and len(set(non_zero_colors)) == 1:
            count = len(non_zero_colors)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                spine = j
    if spine == -1:
        for j in range(m):
            colors = [grid[i][j] for i in middle_rows]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors) and colors[0] != 0:
                spine = j
                break
    return spine
```

```python
def find_specials(grid: List[List[int]], row_color_col: int, m: int, border: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts border positions differing from both neighbors, post-spine.
    special = []
    for j in range(row_color_col + 1, m - 1):
        c = grid[border][j]
        left = grid[border][j - 1]
        right = grid[border][j + 1]
        if c != 0 and c != left and c != right:
            special.append(j)
    return special
```

```python
def group_specials(special: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Groups consecutive specials into lists for differential handling.
    groups = []
    if special:
        current = [special[0]]
        for j in special[1:]:
            if j == current[-1] + 1:
                current.append(j)
            else:
                groups.append(current)
                current = [j]
        groups.append(current)
    return groups
```

```python
def fill_horizontal(g_out: List[List[int]], i: int, l: int, r: int, c: int, skip_center: bool = False, center_j: int = -1):
    # Fills horizontal range in row i with color c, skipping center if flagged, only on zeros.
    for k in range(l, r + 1):
        if g_out[i][k] == 0 and not (skip_center and k == center_j):
            g_out[i][k] = c
```

```python
def fill_vertical(g_out: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, c: int, n: int):
    # Fills immediate up/down in column j from row i with c, only on zeros in middle rows.
    for dr in [-1, 1]:
        ii = i + dr
        if 1 <= ii < n - 1 and g_out[ii][j] == 0:
            g_out[ii][j] = c
```

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The `do_pair` function's extra horizontal fill for adjacent rows of qual2 may overfill, as it applies full horizontals without position checks, potentially ignoring border-specific qualifiers (seen in train1 overfills); it's helpful in concept but buggy in execution—revise to limit to valid qualifiers only.
 * No explicit function for forbidden color clearing; it's inline in program() and works but could be extracted for clarity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles training examples 2 and 3, successfully identifying spines, specials, and propagating without overfills in those cases.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated extra 6's in row 9, columns 5-7 (filled [6,6,6,6] instead of [6,0,0,0]); row 8, column 6 (6 instead of 0); row 10, column 6 (6 instead of 0). These suggest over-propagation of color 6 from a bottom special (likely at col 6 on bottom border), filling horizontals/verticals into areas that should remain zero, possibly due to incorrect skipping or extra adjacent fills in do_pair/do_single for groups involving 6.
 * Spine detection worked (spine at col 3, row_color_col=4), forbidden clearing seems correct (no mismatches there), but special grouping/handling for bottom specials (e.g., 6 at col6) led to filling in non-qualifying rows or without proper l/r bounds.
 * r_cs building and validation for specials worked, as valid_bottom likely included the 6 special but propagation skipped centers incorrectly or applied extras wrongly.
 * No issues with top border processing in train1 (matches expected), indicating asymmetry in top/bottom handling.
 * Overall, the structure (spine, specials, groups, do_single/do_pair) is promising and essential, but refinement needed for skipping logic and extra fills to avoid over-propagation in multi-row effects.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct, as it shows inconsistent propagation (e.g., row 6 has 3's clustered around col5-10 but sparse elsewhere, while row 12 has isolated 7's pre-spine that weren't cleared despite forbidden rules; row 13 has 7 in col2 but not propagated vertically). Expected output should have more symmetric vertical fills from specials (e.g., top specials at cols 7? for 1, but output has sparse 1's in row3 col5 and row12 col5); bottom specials (e.g., row14 cols 6,7,8? with 8,1,9) seem under-propagated, missing horizontals in middle rows like row10/11 around those js. Differences: over-clearing some post-spine areas (e.g., row7 col5=4 but no vertical from it); failure to fill last column consistently (some 9's, but row3 ends with 1 incorrectly?); likely wrong spine (appears col4=3 dominant, but output suggests row_color_col=5 with 9's, leading to mismatched forbidden clears—e.g., 7's persist pre-spine in row12/14). This indicates bugs in forbidden application or qual selection for bottom, similar to train1 over/under-fills; update by tightening qual filters (e.g., stricter <=j for top) and debugging do_pair extras to match expected sparse patterns.
