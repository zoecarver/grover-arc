=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 12:17:42] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:30:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where a central "stem" column (uniform non-zero color) anchors the structure, left-side elements are cleaned to base colors unique to that side, and rows are processed differently: top and bottom rows preserve complex patterns, while middle rows simplify by zeroing internal sections and propagating branch colors to edges or specific positions, likely to represent branching or object outlines without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The stem is a full-height column with a single uniform non-zero color; it's the anchor for left/right division, but not all grids may have it in the same position (e.g., varies across examples: col 4 in ex1, col 5 in ex2, col 4 in ex3).
 * Base colors are those appearing only on the left of the stem (not on right), used to clean extraneous colors from left columns, but this must preserve colors needed for branches; over-cleaning removes valid branch starters.
 * Top and bottom rows (first and last) must retain their full original complexity (e.g., multi-color sequences, blobs, or connected components), without simplification— the code's pass statement is correct but incomplete as prior steps already alter them incorrectly.
 * Middle rows (rows 1 to H-2) simplify drastically: zero out most internal columns (often from stem+1 to near-end), but propagate specific colors (e.g., adjacent to stem or branches) to the last column or targeted positions; branches may form horizontal or diagonal extensions that need to be "collapsed" or mirrored without losing identity.
 * Branches or objects extend from the stem in middle rows, often as single-color protrusions (e.g., a color C next to stem becomes a "branch" that sets the end column to C, but in examples, some branches have internal structure like repeated colors or skips that aren't fully zeroed).
 * Subtle: Not all middle rows have branches; some are just stem color propagated. Branches can be asymmetric or have gaps (e.g., in ex1 row3, a 4 appears in col9, surrounded by zeros). Right side after stem may have unique colors that influence propagation, but aren't base-cleaned.
 * Objects/blobs in top/bottom may connect across columns (e.g., runs of same color), and middle branches might "echo" these but simplified. Zeroing must avoid touching stem or ends prematurely.
 * Edge cases: Variable widths (14-20 cols), heights (10-12 rows); some rows have left-side prefixes (e.g., 8s in ex2 rows 3-5, 7s in ex3 row8) that aren't base colors but must persist if they're "supports" or separate objects.
 * Cleaning left columns only applies to non-base colors, but in practice, it wrongly zeros branch-relevant colors if they're shared right-side.
 * No vertical propagation assumed; each row independent post-stem ID, but patterns suggest horizontal connectivity.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple

def find_stem(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:

```

```python
def find_base_colors(g: List[List[int]], stem_col: int) -> Set[int]:
    # Partially helpful: Attempts to find left-unique colors, but flawed as it subtracts all right colors globally, missing row-specific branches.

    H = len(g)

    return left_colors - right_colors
```

```python
def clean_left_columns(g: List[List[int]], stem_col: int, base_colors: Set[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Somewhat helpful for basic cleaning, but over-aggressive: Zeros non-base in left, but examples show left can have non-base like 8 in ex2 (which persists).
    # Broken for branches: In ex1 row4, it zeros potential branch starters.
    H = len(g)
    W = len(g[0])

def enforce_stem_column(g: List[List[int]], stem_col: int, stem_color: int) -> List[List[int]]:

    # But broken for complex branches: In ex1 row4, expected has 4s in cols 9-11, not all zero + end 4; ignores multi-col branches or skips.
    # Assumes branch always at stem+1, but examples show branches starting later (e.g., ex1 row3 branch at col9).
    H = len(g)
    W = len(g[0])

    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the stem in all training examples (e.g., col4 color3 in ex1, col5 color3 in ex2, col4 color1 in ex3), and partially cleans left to focus on base-like colors.
 * What worked: Stem enforcement keeps vertical uniformity; simple middle row propagation sets ends correctly in uniform cases (e.g., ex1 rows1-2,5-6,8-9,11 end with 3 matching adjacent).
 * What didn't: Over-cleans left columns globally, zeroing valid non-base elements like 8s in ex2 left (expected preserves them as separate objects) and branch internals in ex1 row4 (generated all-zero middle, expected 4s in cols9-11).
 * In ex1: Generated zeros too much in middle rows with branches (row3: expected 4 at col9, but generated all zero except ends; row5: expected 4s cols9-11 +7s cols10-12? Wait, row5 expected [...,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,...3] but generated [...,4,0s,4]; row6 mismatches 7-branch). Top/bottom partially preserved but corrupted by prior cleaning (e.g., top row internals simplified wrongly).
 * In ex2: Left supports (8s in rows3-5) zeroed (generated zeros them, expected keeps 8s in left cols); middle branches not propagated correctly (row1 expected 7s in cols7,11 but generated zeros; row4 expected 5 at col9 but generated zero).
 * In ex3: Middle branches mishandled (row2 expected 3 at col7 but generated zero; row3 expected 3s cols6-8 but generated zeros; row6 expected 6 at col11 but generated zero; row7 expected 6s at cols10,12-13 but generated zero).
 * process_middle_rows assumes fixed branch at stem+1 and full zeroing to end-1, missing variable branch starts/widths (e.g., delayed branches, multi-col blobs).
 * find_base_colors subtracts all right colors, but branches may reuse colors row-locally; needs row-wise or object-based uniqueness.
 * No object extraction: Helpful for identifying branches as connected components (e.g., runs of same color from stem), but absent—would prevent over-zeroing blobs.
 * Top/bottom processing too late; cleaning/enforcing stem alters them before preservation.
 * Overall: Partial understanding of stem and row types, but misses branch detection/propagation and left-object persistence.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overly simplifies middle rows by zeroing everything after stem+1 except the last column (set to adjacent color), and applies cleaning that removes potential left objects/supports (e.g., 7s in row12 col1,3? Expected likely preserves them like ex2/ex3).
 * Mismatches expected patterns: Top row (row0) generated preserves complexity [0s,3,9s,1,9s,3,9s,4,6,9s,8,9] but prior cleaning might have altered it (similar to training); middle rows like row3 generated [...,1,0s,1] but expected probably has branch structure around 1 (e.g., repeated 1s or zeros with internal 1); row6 [...,3,0s,3] misses any branch (expected might have extension); row12 [0,7,0,7,3,1,0s,1] wrongly zeros left 7s (expected preserves as in ex3 row8). Bottom row (row14) generated [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9s,3,9s,4,6,9s,9,9] but likely corrupted by cleaning, missing full expected complexity. No sense of variable branch positions (e.g., 8 at row14 col6 suggests branch start, not propagated correctly). Overall, too uniform and zero-heavy, ignoring blob-like extensions seen in training expecteds.

[2025-10-03 12:30:17] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 12:53:55] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a framed structure where shapes (identified by colors) on the left side of a dividing frame must be extracted, the left side cleared, anchors (colored cells in a specific post-frame column) mirrored to the right edge, and shapes sparsely placed/reconstructed on the right side guided by top-row clues, with rules for handling multiple anchors/clues and avoiding overfilling empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a vertical frame column (F) filled entirely with a single color (frame_color, e.g., 3 or 9) to identify the divider; everything left of F is the "source" for shapes, column S=F+1 holds anchors, top row from S to width-2 holds clues, and the right side (from S onward, excluding the rightmost mirror column) is where shapes get placed.
 * Shapes are extracted from the left (columns 0 to F-1) relative to a center column (mid_col = (F-1)//2), using delta_r and delta_c offsets to define their form; only shapes with matching anchors and clues are considered valid for placement.
 * Placement: Choose the anchor row closest to the shape's original center; start placing at the leftmost (min) clue position p in the top row; only fill if the target cell is empty (0); do not overwrite frame, anchors, or existing placements.
 * Clearing: The entire left side (0 to F-1) must be set to 0 for shapes that get placed, but frame (F) and anchors (S) remain; top/bottom rows often retain full structures, while middle rows should be sparse with many 0s.
 * Anchors: Non-frame colors in column S indicate rows where shapes of that color might anchor; if multiple anchors for a color, only one (closest to center) gets the full shape placement, others get "adjacent fills" (fill cells adjacent to clues, e.g., p-1, p, p+1 if empty).
 * Clues: Top-row non-frame colors from S to width-2; if multiple clues for a color, fill vertically downward from each clue position only in "protected" rows (e.g., the chosen anchor row and its upper offset row), but skip if the row is protected by other colors; single-clue colors don't trigger extra fills.
 * Mirroring: Copy anchors from S to the rightmost column (width-1) exactly.
 * Subtleties: Avoid overfilling—generated outputs fill entire rows/sections with frame_color or shape colors where expected has 0s (e.g., no filling in non-protected rows or outside shape deltas); shapes may have "holes" (0s inside), so extraction must preserve relative positions without assuming solidity; upper/lower offsets define protected rows for vertical clue fills, but only apply to multi-clue cases; if no anchors/clues match, skip placement entirely; frame detection assumes first full-color column is F, but may fail if no such column.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return unchanged; shapes without left cells or no matching anchors/clues are ignored; placements must respect grid bounds; top row clues may overlap with frame/anchors; in trains, bottom rows sometimes retain full shapes, suggesting asymmetric rules for row 0 and height-1.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Shape extraction logic is helpful: defines shapes as defaultdict(set) of delta_r to sets of delta_c, preserving relative positions and holes.
# Also computes orig_center, upper_offset, lower_offset for alignment and protection.
shapes = {}
for c in set(anchors.keys()) & set(clues.keys()):
    left_cells = [(r, col) for r in range(height) for col in range(F) if g[r][col] == c]
    if not left_cells:
        continue
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in left_cells)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in left_cells)
    orig_center = min_r + (max_r - min_r) // 2
    upper_offset = orig_center - min_r
    lower_offset = max_r - orig_center
    shape = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for r, col in left_cells:
        delta_r = r - orig_center
        delta_c = col - mid_col
        shape[delta_r].add(delta_c)
    shapes[c] = (shape, orig_center, upper_offset, lower_offset)
```

```python
# Anchor and clue extraction is essential: anchors from column S, clues from top row S to width-2.
anchors = collections.defaultdict(list)
for r in range(height):
    c = g[r][S]
    if c > 0 and c != frame_color:
        anchors[c].append(r)

clues = collections.defaultdict(list)
for p in range(S, width - 1):
    c = g[0][p]
    if c > 0 and c != frame_color:
        clues[c].append(p)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Frame detection works: correctly identifies F and frame_color (e.g., 3 in train1, places mirror in rightmost column accurately).
 * Shape extraction works partially: relative deltas capture shape forms (e.g., in train1, the 4/7/6 placements in middle rows match expected positions), and clearing left side for placed shapes is done, but top/bottom rows aren't exempted from clearing, leading to partial overwrites.
 * Anchor selection works: chooses closest to orig_center, enabling correct primary placements (e.g., train1 row 5 for 4, row 7 for 7, row 10 for 6).
 * Placement at min(p) with deltas works for core shape: sparse fills in right side match expected in some spots (e.g., train1 row 4: [4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,...] vs expected similar but with more 0s).
 * Mirroring anchors to rightmost column works fully across all trains.
 * Skipped anchors adjacent fill partially works but over-applies: in train3, fills some adjacent but generates extra 2s where expected has 0s (e.g., row 1: full 2s vs sparse).
 * Clue single fills for multi-ps is broken: overfills vertically in non-protected rows with shape color (e.g., train1 rows 1-3,8-11 filled with 3s where expected 0s; logic skips only if row protected but c not in protectors, but applies too broadly, filling if condition fails incorrectly).
 * Protected rows (upper/center) concept is good but inverted/buggy: adds c to row_to_protecting for upper_pr and center_pr, but then in fills: "if r in row_to_protecting and c not in row_to_protecting[r]: continue" skips fills in protected rows if c isn't protecting it, but expected has fills ONLY in protected rows for multi-clues—logic should fill IF c in protectors, not skip otherwise; causes under/over-filling (e.g., train2 row 1: fills 4s where expected 0s/7s sparse).
 * Overfilling with frame_color (e.g., 3 or 9) in empty right areas: generated treats many 0s as fillable, but expected keeps 0s outside shapes/clues/anchors (e.g., train1 row 1: full 3s vs [3,0,0,0,...3]; unknown if due to missing bound checks or wrong fill condition).
 * Multi-clue handling incomplete: for colors like 3 in train1 (multiple clues?), fills too much vertically without restricting to protected rows only.
 * Left clearing too aggressive: clears all left for any c in shapes, but expected retains some left structures? Wait, no—expected clears most left to 0s, but generated sometimes leaves uncleared (e.g., train1 row 0 has 2,3,6,4,7 but expected same, so top row not cleared—code clears all rows 0-F, but out = copy then clear, yet top/bottom match input, suggesting code doesn't overwrite top/bottom? Actually, code clears all, but in generated row 0 matches expected, maybe input has it).
 * No handling for bottom row retention: expected often keeps bottom full like top, but code places/sparsifies it.
 * Function for frame finding is helpful but assumes first full column >0; works for trains but may miss if frame not first.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it overfills large sections of the right side with 9s (likely frame_color) in rows 1,2,5,11,13,14 where expected should have sparse placements and many 0s (similar to train patterns, e.g., row 1 should likely be sparse 9s only at clue/anchor positions, not full rows); placements like row 7 [3,4,0,0,...4] seem partially correct but surrounded by extra 9s; row 9 has 6s placed but extra 0-fills missing sparsity; row 12 has 1s and 7s but overfills 9s in non-shape areas; overall, mirrors anchors correctly (e.g., rightmost column has 3s), but clue-driven vertical fills are too broad, ignoring protected row restrictions and creating solid blocks instead of isolated shapes; does not account for multi-clue colors (e.g., possible multiple 9s or 3s) needing only protected fills, leading to invalid density.

[2025-10-03 12:53:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where a central "stem" column (uniform non-zero color) anchors the structure, left-side elements are cleaned to base colors unique to that side, and rows are processed differently: top and bottom rows preserve complex patterns, while middle rows simplify by zeroing internal sections and propagating branch colors to edges or specific positions, likely to represent branching or object outlines without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The stem is a full-height column with a single uniform non-zero color; it's the anchor for left/right division, but not all grids may have it in the same position (e.g., varies across examples: col 4 in ex1, col 5 in ex2, col 4 in ex3).
 * Base colors are those appearing only on the left of the stem (not on right), used to clean extraneous colors from left columns, but this must preserve colors needed for branches; over-cleaning removes valid branch starters.
 * Top and bottom rows (first and last) must retain their full original complexity (e.g., multi-color sequences, blobs, or connected components), without simplification— the code's pass statement is correct but incomplete as prior steps already alter them incorrectly.
 * Middle rows (rows 1 to H-2) simplify drastically: zero out most internal columns (often from stem+1 to near-end), but propagate specific colors (e.g., adjacent to stem or branches) to the last column or targeted positions; branches may form horizontal or diagonal extensions that need to be "collapsed" or mirrored without losing identity.
 * Branches or objects extend from the stem in middle rows, often as single-color protrusions (e.g., a color C next to stem becomes a "branch" that sets the end column to C, but in examples, some branches have internal structure like repeated colors or skips that aren't fully zeroed).
 * Subtle: Not all middle rows have branches; some are just stem color propagated. Branches can be asymmetric or have gaps (e.g., in ex1 row3, a 4 appears in col9, surrounded by zeros). Right side after stem may have unique colors that influence propagation, but aren't base-cleaned.
 * Objects/blobs in top/bottom may connect across columns (e.g., runs of same color), and middle branches might "echo" these but simplified. Zeroing must avoid touching stem or ends prematurely.
 * Edge cases: Variable widths (14-20 cols), heights (10-12 rows); some rows have left-side prefixes (e.g., 8s in ex2 rows 3-5, 7s in ex3 row8) that aren't base colors but must persist if they're "supports" or separate objects.
 * Cleaning left columns only applies to non-base colors, but in practice, it wrongly zeros branch-relevant colors if they're shared right-side.
 * No vertical propagation assumed; each row independent post-stem ID, but patterns suggest horizontal connectivity.

            out[i][col] = 0
        out[i][W - 1] = C
    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the stem in all training examples (e.g., col4 color3 in ex1, col5 color3 in ex2, col4 color1 in ex3), and partially cleans left to focus on base-like colors.
 * What worked: Stem enforcement keeps vertical uniformity; simple middle row propagation sets ends correctly in uniform cases (e.g., ex1 rows1-2,5-6,8-9,11 end with 3 matching adjacent).
 * What didn't: Over-cleans left columns globally, zeroing valid non-base elements like 8s in ex2 left (expected preserves them as separate objects) and branch internals in ex1 row4 (generated all-zero middle, expected 4s in cols9-11).
 * In ex1: Generated zeros too much in middle rows with branches (row3: expected 4 at col9, but generated all zero except ends; row5: expected 4s cols9-11 +7s cols10-12? Wait, row5 expected [...,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,...3] but generated [...,4,0s,4]; row6 mismatches 7-branch). Top/bottom partially preserved but corrupted by prior cleaning (e.g., top row internals simplified wrongly).
 * In ex2: Left supports (8s in rows3-5) zeroed (generated zeros them, expected keeps 8s in left cols); middle branches not propagated correctly (row1 expected 7s in cols7,11 but generated zeros; row4 expected 5 at col9 but generated zero).
 * In ex3: Middle branches mishandled (row2 expected 3 at col7 but generated zero; row3 expected 3s cols6-8 but generated zeros; row6 expected 6 at col11 but generated zero; row7 expected 6s at cols10,12-13 but generated zero).
 * process_middle_rows assumes fixed branch at stem+1 and full zeroing to end-1, missing variable branch starts/widths (e.g., delayed branches, multi-col blobs).
 * find_base_colors subtracts all right colors, but branches may reuse colors row-locally; needs row-wise or object-based uniqueness.
 * No object extraction: Helpful for identifying branches as connected components (e.g., runs of same color from stem), but absent—would prevent over-zeroing blobs.
 * Top/bottom processing too late; cleaning/enforcing stem alters them before preservation.
 * Overall: Partial understanding of stem and row types, but misses branch detection/propagation and left-object persistence.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overly simplifies middle rows by zeroing everything after stem+1 except the last column (set to adjacent color), and applies cleaning that removes potential left objects/supports (e.g., 7s in row12 col1,3? Expected likely preserves them like ex2/ex3).
 * Mismatches expected patterns: Top row (row0) generated preserves complexity [0s,3,9s,1,9s,3,9s,4,6,9s,8,9] but prior cleaning might have altered it (similar to training); middle rows like row3 generated [...,1,0s,1] but expected probably has branch structure around 1 (e.g., repeated 1s or zeros with internal 1); row6 [...,3,0s,3] misses any branch (expected might have extension); row12 [0,7,0,7,3,1,0s,1] wrongly zeros left 7s (expected preserves as in ex3 row8). Bottom row (row14) generated [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9s,3,9s,4,6,9s,9,9] but likely corrupted by cleaning, missing full expected complexity. No sense of variable branch positions (e.g., 8 at row14 col6 suggests branch start, not propagated correctly). Overall, too uniform and zero-heavy, ignoring blob-like extensions seen in training expecteds.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a framed structure where shapes (identified by colors) on the left side of a dividing frame must be extracted, the left side cleared, anchors (colored cells in a specific post-frame column) mirrored to the right edge, and shapes sparsely placed/reconstructed on the right side guided by top-row clues, with rules for handling multiple anchors/clues and avoiding overfilling empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a vertical frame column (F) filled entirely with a single color (frame_color, e.g., 3 or 9) to identify the divider; everything left of F is the "source" for shapes, column S=F+1 holds anchors, top row from S to width-2 holds clues, and the right side (from S onward, excluding the rightmost mirror column) is where shapes get placed.
 * Shapes are extracted from the left (columns 0 to F-1) relative to a center column (mid_col = (F-1)//2), using delta_r and delta_c offsets to define their form; only shapes with matching anchors and clues are considered valid for placement.
 * Placement: Choose the anchor row closest to the shape's original center; start placing at the leftmost (min) clue position p in the top row; only fill if the target cell is empty (0); do not overwrite frame, anchors, or existing placements.
 * Clearing: The entire left side (0 to F-1) must be set to 0 for shapes that get placed, but frame (F) and anchors (S) remain; top/bottom rows often retain full structures, while middle rows should be sparse with many 0s.
 * Anchors: Non-frame colors in column S indicate rows where shapes of that color might anchor; if multiple anchors for a color, only one (closest to center) gets the full shape placement, others get "adjacent fills" (fill cells adjacent to clues, e.g., p-1, p, p+1 if empty).
 * Clues: Top-row non-frame colors from S to width-2; if multiple clues for a color, fill vertically downward from each clue position only in "protected" rows (e.g., the chosen anchor row and its upper offset row), but skip if the row is protected by other colors; single-clue colors don't trigger extra fills.
 * Mirroring: Copy anchors from S to the rightmost column (width-1) exactly.
 * Subtleties: Avoid overfilling—generated outputs fill entire rows/sections with frame_color or shape colors where expected has 0s (e.g., no filling in non-protected rows or outside shape deltas); shapes may have "holes" (0s inside), so extraction must preserve relative positions without assuming solidity; upper/lower offsets define protected rows for vertical clue fills, but only apply to multi-clue cases; if no anchors/clues match, skip placement entirely; frame detection assumes first full-color column is F, but may fail if no such column.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return unchanged; shapes without left cells or no matching anchors/clues are ignored; placements must respect grid bounds; top row clues may overlap with frame/anchors; in trains, bottom rows sometimes retain full shapes, suggesting asymmetric rules for row 0 and height-1.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Shape extraction logic is helpful: defines shapes as defaultdict(set) of delta_r to sets of delta_c, preserving relative positions and holes.
# Also computes orig_center, upper_offset, lower_offset for alignment and protection.
shapes = {}
for c in set(anchors.keys()) & set(clues.keys()):
    left_cells = [(r, col) for r in range(height) for col in range(F) if g[r][col] == c]
    if not left_cells:
        continue
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in left_cells)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in left_cells)
    orig_center = min_r + (max_r - min_r) // 2
    upper_offset = orig_center - min_r
    lower_offset = max_r - orig_center
    shape = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for r, col in left_cells:
        delta_r = r - orig_center
        delta_c = col - mid_col
        shape[delta_r].add(delta_c)
    shapes[c] = (shape, orig_center, upper_offset, lower_offset)
```

```python
# Anchor and clue extraction is essential: anchors from column S, clues from top row S to width-2.
anchors = collections.defaultdict(list)
for r in range(height):
    c = g[r][S]
    if c > 0 and c != frame_color:
        anchors[c].append(r)

clues = collections.defaultdict(list)
for p in range(S, width - 1):
    c = g[0][p]
    if c > 0 and c != frame_color:
        clues[c].append(p)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Frame detection works: correctly identifies F and frame_color (e.g., 3 in train1, places mirror in rightmost column accurately).
 * Shape extraction works partially: relative deltas capture shape forms (e.g., in train1, the 4/7/6 placements in middle rows match expected positions), and clearing left side for placed shapes is done, but top/bottom rows aren't exempted from clearing, leading to partial overwrites.
 * Anchor selection works: chooses closest to orig_center, enabling correct primary placements (e.g., train1 row 5 for 4, row 7 for 7, row 10 for 6).
 * Placement at min(p) with deltas works for core shape: sparse fills in right side match expected in some spots (e.g., train1 row 4: [4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,...] vs expected similar but with more 0s).
 * Mirroring anchors to rightmost column works fully across all trains.
 * Skipped anchors adjacent fill partially works but over-applies: in train3, fills some adjacent but generates extra 2s where expected has 0s (e.g., row 1: full 2s vs sparse).
 * Clue single fills for multi-ps is broken: overfills vertically in non-protected rows with shape color (e.g., train1 rows 1-3,8-11 filled with 3s where expected 0s; logic skips only if row protected but c not in protectors, but applies too broadly, filling if condition fails incorrectly).
 * Protected rows (upper/center) concept is good but inverted/buggy: adds c to row_to_protecting for upper_pr and center_pr, but then in fills: "if r in row_to_protecting and c not in row_to_protecting[r]: continue" skips fills in protected rows if c isn't protecting it, but expected has fills ONLY in protected rows for multi-clues—logic should fill IF c in protectors, not skip otherwise; causes under/over-filling (e.g., train2 row 1: fills 4s where expected 0s/7s sparse).
 * Overfilling with frame_color (e.g., 3 or 9) in empty right areas: generated treats many 0s as fillable, but expected keeps 0s outside shapes/clues/anchors (e.g., train1 row 1: full 3s vs [3,0,0,0,...3]; unknown if due to missing bound checks or wrong fill condition).
 * Multi-clue handling incomplete: for colors like 3 in train1 (multiple clues?), fills too much vertically without restricting to protected rows only.
 * Left clearing too aggressive: clears all left for any c in shapes, but expected retains some left structures? Wait, no—expected clears most left to 0s, but generated sometimes leaves uncleared (e.g., train1 row 0 has 2,3,6,4,7 but expected same, so top row not cleared—code clears all rows 0-F, but out = copy then clear, yet top/bottom match input, suggesting code doesn't overwrite top/bottom? Actually, code clears all, but in generated row 0 matches expected, maybe input has it).
 * No handling for bottom row retention: expected often keeps bottom full like top, but code places/sparsifies it.
 * Function for frame finding is helpful but assumes first full column >0; works for trains but may miss if frame not first.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it overfills large sections of the right side with 9s (likely frame_color) in rows 1,2,5,11,13,14 where expected should have sparse placements and many 0s (similar to train patterns, e.g., row 1 should likely be sparse 9s only at clue/anchor positions, not full rows); placements like row 7 [3,4,0,0,...4] seem partially correct but surrounded by extra 9s; row 9 has 6s placed but extra 0-fills missing sparsity; row 12 has 1s and 7s but overfills 9s in non-shape areas; overall, mirrors anchors correctly (e.g., rightmost column has 3s), but clue-driven vertical fills are too broad, ignoring protected row restrictions and creating solid blocks instead of isolated shapes; does not account for multi-clue colors (e.g., possible multiple 9s or 3s) needing only protected fills, leading to invalid density.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 13:22:15] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle-solving task where the goal is to generate Python code containing a required 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns, objects, or puzzles) to produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, simulating puzzle rules like object extraction, pattern matching, or grid manipulation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must include a 'program' function as the entry point; without it, all evaluations fail with an error, preventing any puzzle logic from executing.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid analysis, such as identifying objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, holes) in a 2D array of integers (possibly 0s for empty, 1s for filled cells), applying rules like counting connected components, omitting certain elements, or matching patterns.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure generated code handles varying grid sizes, edge cases like disconnected objects or asymmetric patterns, and exact output formatting (e.g., specific grid representations or lists); mismatches in shape, omission of dividers/keys, or incorrect blob identification could occur due to flawed extraction logic.
 * Considerations across attempts: No successful runs, so focus on basic structure first; mentally simulate rules on test input (unknown grid, but expected output should match puzzle semantics like object counts or transformed grids); avoid irrelevant functions that don't tie to grid processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the core 'program' function. Future attempts should prioritize defining 'program' to take inputs like grid lists and return puzzle-specific outputs (e.g., extracted features or solved grids).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1-3) and test input failed identically due to missing 'program' function, resulting in no puzzle processing or output generation.
 * No elements worked, as the code structure was invalid from the start; expected was valid code execution leading to correct puzzle outputs (e.g., matching training results), but observed only errors.
 * No object extraction or grid manipulation attempted, so no insights into puzzle rules like connected components or hole counting.
 * This attempt demonstrates zero progress on puzzle understanding, as even basic code validity was not achieved.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as it provides no puzzle solution or grid processing result.
 * Expected: A valid output based on test input grid rules (e.g., identified objects, transformed pattern, or numeric result matching puzzle semantics), but observed error means no simulation or matching possible; this blocks any verification of puzzle logic.
 * To handle test case, ensure 'program' function processes the specific test grid (unknown details, but likely requires object detection or rule application); current output is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where a central "stem" column (uniform non-zero color) anchors the structure, left-side elements are cleaned to base colors unique to that side, and rows are processed differently: top and bottom rows preserve complex patterns, while middle rows simplify by zeroing internal sections and propagating branch colors to edges or specific positions, likely to represent branching or object outlines without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The stem is a full-height column with a single uniform non-zero color; it's the anchor for left/right division, but not all grids may have it in the same position (e.g., varies across examples: col 4 in ex1, col 5 in ex2, col 4 in ex3).
 * Base colors are those appearing only on the left of the stem (not on right), used to clean extraneous colors from left columns, but this must preserve colors needed for branches; over-cleaning removes valid branch starters.
 * Top and bottom rows (first and last) must retain their full original complexity (e.g., multi-color sequences, blobs, or connected components), without simplification— the code's pass statement is correct but incomplete as prior steps already alter them incorrectly.
 * Middle rows (rows 1 to H-2) simplify drastically: zero out most internal columns (often from stem+1 to near-end), but propagate specific colors (e.g., adjacent to stem or branches) to the last column or targeted positions; branches may form horizontal or diagonal extensions that need to be "collapsed" or mirrored without losing identity.
 * Branches or objects extend from the stem in middle rows, often as single-color protrusions (e.g., a color C next to stem becomes a "branch" that sets the end column to C, but in examples, some branches have internal structure like repeated colors or skips that aren't fully zeroed).
 * Subtle: Not all middle rows have branches; some are just stem color propagated. Branches can be asymmetric or have gaps (e.g., in ex1 row3, a 4 appears in col9, surrounded by zeros). Right side after stem may have unique colors that influence propagation, but aren't base-cleaned.
 * Objects/blobs in top/bottom may connect across columns (e.g., runs of same color), and middle branches might "echo" these but simplified. Zeroing must avoid touching stem or ends prematurely.
 * Edge cases: Variable widths (14-20 cols), heights (10-12 rows); some rows have left-side prefixes (e.g., 8s in ex2 rows 3-5, 7s in ex3 row8) that aren't base colors but must persist if they're "supports" or separate objects.
 * Cleaning left columns only applies to non-base colors, but in practice, it wrongly zeros branch-relevant colors if they're shared right-side.
 * No vertical propagation assumed; each row independent post-stem ID, but patterns suggest horizontal connectivity.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple

def find_stem(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Helpful: Correctly identifies uniform non-zero stem column by checking full column uniformity.
    # Used successfully in all examples to find col (e.g., 4 with color 3 in ex1).
    H = len(g)
    if H == 0:
        raise ValueError("Empty grid")
    W = len(g[0])
    for col in range(W):
        col_colors = [row[col] for row in g]

        if first != 0 and all(c == first for c in col_colors):
            return col, first
    raise ValueError("No stem column found")
```

```python
def find_base_colors(g: List[List[int]], stem_col: int) -> Set[int]:
    # Partially helpful: Attempts to find left-unique colors, but flawed as it subtracts all right colors globally, missing row-specific branches.
    # In ex1, it might ID {2,4,6,7} but wrongly cleans row-specific extensions like 4 in middle.
    H = len(g)
    W = len(g[0])

            if c != 0:
                right_colors.add(c)
    return left_colors - right_colors
```

```python
def clean_left_columns(g: List[List[int]], stem_col: int, base_colors: Set[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Somewhat helpful for basic cleaning, but over-aggressive: Zeros non-base in left, but examples show left can have non-base like 8 in ex2 (which persists).
    # Broken for branches: In ex1 row4, it zeros potential branch starters.
    H = len(g)
    W = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]

            if out[i][col] not in base_colors:
                out[i][col] = 0
    return out
```

```python
def enforce_stem_column(g: List[List[int]], stem_col: int, stem_color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Helpful: Ensures stem is uniform, which matches expectations (e.g., all 3s in ex1 stem).
    H = len(g)
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(H):
        out[i][stem_col] = stem_color

```

```python
def process_top_and_bottom(g: List[List[int]], stem_col: int) -> List[List[int]]:

    H = len(g)
    out = [row[:] for row in g]

    # Not fully helpful: Zeros from branch_col+1 to W-2 and sets last to branch_col color, which works for simple cases (e.g., ex1 many rows set end to adjacent color).
    # But broken for complex branches: In ex1 row4, expected has 4s in cols 9-11, not all zero + end 4; ignores multi-col branches or skips.
    # Assumes branch always at stem+1, but examples show branches starting later (e.g., ex1 row3 branch at col9).
    H = len(g)
    W = len(g[0])
    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    branch_col = stem_col + 1
    for i in range(1, H - 1):
        if branch_col < W:
            C = out[i][branch_col]
        else:
            C = 0
        for col in range(branch_col + 1, W - 1):
            out[i][col] = 0
        out[i][W - 1] = C
    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the stem in all training examples (e.g., col4 color3 in ex1, col5 color3 in ex2, col4 color1 in ex3), and partially cleans left to focus on base-like colors.
 * What worked: Stem enforcement keeps vertical uniformity; simple middle row propagation sets ends correctly in uniform cases (e.g., ex1 rows1-2,5-6,8-9,11 end with 3 matching adjacent).
 * What didn't: Over-cleans left columns globally, zeroing valid non-base elements like 8s in ex2 left (expected preserves them as separate objects) and branch internals in ex1 row4 (generated all-zero middle, expected 4s in cols9-11).
 * In ex1: Generated zeros too much in middle rows with branches (row3: expected 4 at col9, but generated all zero except ends; row5: expected 4s cols9-11 +7s cols10-12? Wait, row5 expected [...,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,...3] but generated [...,4,0s,4]; row6 mismatches 7-branch). Top/bottom partially preserved but corrupted by prior cleaning (e.g., top row internals simplified wrongly).
 * In ex2: Left supports (8s in rows3-5) zeroed (generated zeros them, expected keeps 8s in left cols); middle branches not propagated correctly (row1 expected 7s in cols7,11 but generated zeros; row4 expected 5 at col9 but generated zero).
 * In ex3: Middle branches mishandled (row2 expected 3 at col7 but generated zero; row3 expected 3s cols6-8 but generated zeros; row6 expected 6 at col11 but generated zero; row7 expected 6s at cols10,12-13 but generated zero).
 * process_middle_rows assumes fixed branch at stem+1 and full zeroing to end-1, missing variable branch starts/widths (e.g., delayed branches, multi-col blobs).
 * find_base_colors subtracts all right colors, but branches may reuse colors row-locally; needs row-wise or object-based uniqueness.
 * No object extraction: Helpful for identifying branches as connected components (e.g., runs of same color from stem), but absent—would prevent over-zeroing blobs.
 * Top/bottom processing too late; cleaning/enforcing stem alters them before preservation.
 * Overall: Partial understanding of stem and row types, but misses branch detection/propagation and left-object persistence.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overly simplifies middle rows by zeroing everything after stem+1 except the last column (set to adjacent color), and applies cleaning that removes potential left objects/supports (e.g., 7s in row12 col1,3? Expected likely preserves them like ex2/ex3).
 * Mismatches expected patterns: Top row (row0) generated preserves complexity [0s,3,9s,1,9s,3,9s,4,6,9s,8,9] but prior cleaning might have altered it (similar to training); middle rows like row3 generated [...,1,0s,1] but expected probably has branch structure around 1 (e.g., repeated 1s or zeros with internal 1); row6 [...,3,0s,3] misses any branch (expected might have extension); row12 [0,7,0,7,3,1,0s,1] wrongly zeros left 7s (expected preserves as in ex3 row8). Bottom row (row14) generated [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9s,3,9s,4,6,9s,9,9] but likely corrupted by cleaning, missing full expected complexity. No sense of variable branch positions (e.g., 8 at row14 col6 suggests branch start, not propagated correctly). Overall, too uniform and zero-heavy, ignoring blob-like extensions seen in training expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a framed structure where shapes (identified by colors) on the left side of a dividing frame must be extracted, the left side cleared, anchors (colored cells in a specific post-frame column) mirrored to the right edge, and shapes sparsely placed/reconstructed on the right side guided by top-row clues, with rules for handling multiple anchors/clues and avoiding overfilling empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a vertical frame column (F) filled entirely with a single color (frame_color, e.g., 3 or 9) to identify the divider; everything left of F is the "source" for shapes, column S=F+1 holds anchors, top row from S to width-2 holds clues, and the right side (from S onward, excluding the rightmost mirror column) is where shapes get placed.
 * Shapes are extracted from the left (columns 0 to F-1) relative to a center column (mid_col = (F-1)//2), using delta_r and delta_c offsets to define their form; only shapes with matching anchors and clues are considered valid for placement.
 * Placement: Choose the anchor row closest to the shape's original center; start placing at the leftmost (min) clue position p in the top row; only fill if the target cell is empty (0); do not overwrite frame, anchors, or existing placements.
 * Clearing: The entire left side (0 to F-1) must be set to 0 for shapes that get placed, but frame (F) and anchors (S) remain; top/bottom rows often retain full structures, while middle rows should be sparse with many 0s.
 * Anchors: Non-frame colors in column S indicate rows where shapes of that color might anchor; if multiple anchors for a color, only one (closest to center) gets the full shape placement, others get "adjacent fills" (fill cells adjacent to clues, e.g., p-1, p, p+1 if empty).
 * Clues: Top-row non-frame colors from S to width-2; if multiple clues for a color, fill vertically downward from each clue position only in "protected" rows (e.g., the chosen anchor row and its upper offset row), but skip if the row is protected by other colors; single-clue colors don't trigger extra fills.
 * Mirroring: Copy anchors from S to the rightmost column (width-1) exactly.
 * Subtleties: Avoid overfilling—generated outputs fill entire rows/sections with frame_color or shape colors where expected has 0s (e.g., no filling in non-protected rows or outside shape deltas); shapes may have "holes" (0s inside), so extraction must preserve relative positions without assuming solidity; upper/lower offsets define protected rows for vertical clue fills, but only apply to multi-clue cases; if no anchors/clues match, skip placement entirely; frame detection assumes first full-color column is F, but may fail if no such column.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return unchanged; shapes without left cells or no matching anchors/clues are ignored; placements must respect grid bounds; top row clues may overlap with frame/anchors; in trains, bottom rows sometimes retain full shapes, suggesting asymmetric rules for row 0 and height-1.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Shape extraction logic is helpful: defines shapes as defaultdict(set) of delta_r to sets of delta_c, preserving relative positions and holes.
# Also computes orig_center, upper_offset, lower_offset for alignment and protection.
shapes = {}
for c in set(anchors.keys()) & set(clues.keys()):
    left_cells = [(r, col) for r in range(height) for col in range(F) if g[r][col] == c]
    if not left_cells:
        continue
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in left_cells)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in left_cells)
    orig_center = min_r + (max_r - min_r) // 2
    upper_offset = orig_center - min_r
    lower_offset = max_r - orig_center
    shape = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for r, col in left_cells:
        delta_r = r - orig_center
        delta_c = col - mid_col
        shape[delta_r].add(delta_c)
    shapes[c] = (shape, orig_center, upper_offset, lower_offset)
```

```python
# Anchor and clue extraction is essential: anchors from column S, clues from top row S to width-2.
anchors = collections.defaultdict(list)
for r in range(height):
    c = g[r][S]
    if c > 0 and c != frame_color:
        anchors[c].append(r)

clues = collections.defaultdict(list)
for p in range(S, width - 1):
    c = g[0][p]
    if c > 0 and c != frame_color:
        clues[c].append(p)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Frame detection works: correctly identifies F and frame_color (e.g., 3 in train1, places mirror in rightmost column accurately).
 * Shape extraction works partially: relative deltas capture shape forms (e.g., in train1, the 4/7/6 placements in middle rows match expected positions), and clearing left side for placed shapes is done, but top/bottom rows aren't exempted from clearing, leading to partial overwrites.
 * Anchor selection works: chooses closest to orig_center, enabling correct primary placements (e.g., train1 row 5 for 4, row 7 for 7, row 10 for 6).
 * Placement at min(p) with deltas works for core shape: sparse fills in right side match expected in some spots (e.g., train1 row 4: [4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,...] vs expected similar but with more 0s).
 * Mirroring anchors to rightmost column works fully across all trains.
 * Skipped anchors adjacent fill partially works but over-applies: in train3, fills some adjacent but generates extra 2s where expected has 0s (e.g., row 1: full 2s vs sparse).
 * Clue single fills for multi-ps is broken: overfills vertically in non-protected rows with shape color (e.g., train1 rows 1-3,8-11 filled with 3s where expected 0s; logic skips only if row protected but c not in protectors, but applies too broadly, filling if condition fails incorrectly).
 * Protected rows (upper/center) concept is good but inverted/buggy: adds c to row_to_protecting for upper_pr and center_pr, but then in fills: "if r in row_to_protecting and c not in row_to_protecting[r]: continue" skips fills in protected rows if c isn't protecting it, but expected has fills ONLY in protected rows for multi-clues—logic should fill IF c in protectors, not skip otherwise; causes under/over-filling (e.g., train2 row 1: fills 4s where expected 0s/7s sparse).
 * Overfilling with frame_color (e.g., 3 or 9) in empty right areas: generated treats many 0s as fillable, but expected keeps 0s outside shapes/clues/anchors (e.g., train1 row 1: full 3s vs [3,0,0,0,...3]; unknown if due to missing bound checks or wrong fill condition).
 * Multi-clue handling incomplete: for colors like 3 in train1 (multiple clues?), fills too much vertically without restricting to protected rows only.
 * Left clearing too aggressive: clears all left for any c in shapes, but expected retains some left structures? Wait, no—expected clears most left to 0s, but generated sometimes leaves uncleared (e.g., train1 row 0 has 2,3,6,4,7 but expected same, so top row not cleared—code clears all rows 0-F, but out = copy then clear, yet top/bottom match input, suggesting code doesn't overwrite top/bottom? Actually, code clears all, but in generated row 0 matches expected, maybe input has it).
 * No handling for bottom row retention: expected often keeps bottom full like top, but code places/sparsifies it.
 * Function for frame finding is helpful but assumes first full column >0; works for trains but may miss if frame not first.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it overfills large sections of the right side with 9s (likely frame_color) in rows 1,2,5,11,13,14 where expected should have sparse placements and many 0s (similar to train patterns, e.g., row 1 should likely be sparse 9s only at clue/anchor positions, not full rows); placements like row 7 [3,4,0,0,...4] seem partially correct but surrounded by extra 9s; row 9 has 6s placed but extra 0-fills missing sparsity; row 12 has 1s and 7s but overfills 9s in non-shape areas; overall, mirrors anchors correctly (e.g., rightmost column has 3s), but clue-driven vertical fills are too broad, ignoring protected row restrictions and creating solid blocks instead of isolated shapes; does not account for multi-clue colors (e.g., possible multiple 9s or 3s) needing only protected fills, leading to invalid density.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 13:51:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving colored grids (numbers as colors) where the left side contains structural elements like support stems, base colors, and object shapes, while the right side uses top-row clues and anchor positions to mirror or replicate transformed versions of those left-side shapes, often with cleaning of non-essential colors in middle rows and specific placement rules to avoid overlaps or frame interference.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a left "support stem" (uniform non-zero column, often the leftmost), followed by a "main stem" column that acts as a frame or divider, uniform or dominant in a frame color (e.g., appearing >H//2 times, matching top/bottom).
 * Base colors are those unique to the left of the main stem (not appearing on the right at all in input), used to preserve only relevant left-side elements; middle rows (1 to H-2) on the left must be cleaned to remove non-base colors, but top/bottom rows stay intact.
 * Shapes are extracted from the left side per color C (non-frame, non-zero), using relative deltas from a center row and mid-column ((stem_col-1)//2), capturing the "form" of objects like branches or blobs.
 * Clues are non-frame colors in the top row (row 0) from key_col (stem or stem+1 if uniform) to W-2; anchors are similar colors in the key_col for middle rows.
 * Placement: For each color C with both clues and anchors, select a primary anchor (closest to the shape's original center row); place the full shape (all deltas) aligned to that primary anchor row and each clue column on the right (key_col+1 to W-2), but skip positive delta_r (downward extensions) if the original center is above the primary anchor to avoid "upside-down" or incomplete mirroring; for secondary anchors (other rows with C in key_col), only fill horizontal adjacents (±1 column) at clue positions, not full shapes.
 * Right side mirroring: Set the rightmost column (W-1) to copy the key_col values for all rows; zero out inner right middle rows (key_col+1 to W-2, rows 1 to H-2) initially to clear space before placements.
 * Subtleties: Frame color (main stem's mode) must not be placed as a shape; empty shapes (no left cells for C) skip all placements for that C; placements only if target cell is empty and within bounds; shapes may be asymmetric vertically (e.g., tree-like branches extending more up or down); if stem is uniform, key_col shifts right to stem+1 for anchors/clues; top/bottom rows on right may retain or copy frame elements but not get shape fills in middle.
 * Overlaps/priorities: Placements only on empty cells, so order matters (colors processed in dict order, which is insertion order); no overwriting existing non-zero cells.
 * Edge cases: No left stem (start from col 0); no main stem (error, but assume always present); colors appearing both sides aren't base; horizontal fills for secondaries are limited to clue ±1, not full rows.
 * All rows/columns 0-indexed; H = rows, W = columns assumed rectangular.

(Note: The above are helpful for structure detection, cleaning, and shape extraction; they capture core elements like stems and relative positioning well, but placement logic using them needs refinement for anchor selection and delta skipping.)

```python
def extract_anchors(out: List[List[int]], key_col: int, frame_color: int, H: int) -> Dict[int, List[int]]:
    """Extract anchor rows (middle rows) per color C != frame_color where key_col == C."""

        if c != 0 and c != frame_color:
            clues[c].append(p)
    return dict(clues)
```
(These are helpful for identifying placement targets but assume post-cleaning grid; they ignore frame color correctly.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `set_mirror_column`: Overly simplistic; it copies key_col to W-1 unconditionally, but expected outputs show W-1 often mirrors frame or specific colors selectively (e.g., in train1 row0, it's 3 not copying extras; causes unwanted fills like extra 4 in train1 row0 col1? Wait, col1 is left, but mirroring affects right).
- `zero_inner_right_middle`: Clears too aggressively before placements, but in expected, some right inner cells retain input values if not overwritten (e.g., train2 row1 col7 should be 7 from input, but generated has 0).
- `place_primary_shape` and `place_secondary_fills`: Logic for skipping positive delta_r is inverted or misapplied (e.g., in train1 for color 7, it places full shape at secondary row7 instead of just horizontal fill, leading to extra 7's? But actually in generated row7 has 7's like expected—wait, differences elsewhere); doesn't handle multiple primaries or vertical alignment precisely.
- `place_shapes`: Processes colors in arbitrary order (dict keys), causing overwrite issues; skips empty shapes correctly but doesn't handle cases where anchors exist without clues or vice versa.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of placement rules, especially shape replication and cleaning.
 * Train 1: Generated has extra 4 in row0 col1 (should be 0, perhaps from uncleaned left or mirror leak); row7 incorrectly places full shape for color 7 at what should be secondary anchor (but actually matches expected there—difference is subtle: row8 generated has no 7's in col9-11, expected has them? Wait, generated row7 is [...,7,7,7,...] but expected row7 [...,7,7,7,...] same; actual diff in row0 left extras and possibly missing downward extensions for color 4 in row5 col9=4 expected but generated has it? Upon close check, main diffs: generated row0 col1=4 (extra, not cleaned/mirrored wrong); row4 col18=4 (matches); but row11 col1=0 expected 0; unknown why left top not cleaned fully.
 * Train 2: Generated misses several 7's in right inner columns for middle rows (e.g., row1 col7=0 expected 7; row3 col7=0 expected 7; row6 col7=0 expected 7; row8 col7=7 matches but row8 col8=0 expected 7?); over-places 5's or 8's wrongly (e.g., row4 col8=0 expected 0, but row5 col8=5 expected 0? Wait, generated row5 [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5] has extra 5's at col7,9 vs expected [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5] missing col7/9 0's); suggests secondary fills too broad or primary shape misaligned for color 5/7.
 * Train 3: Generated has extra 3 in row0 col1 (should be 0, similar to train1 left unclean); row8 left has 7,7,7 in col0-2 (expected same? Wait matches); but misses placements for color 3 in row2 col7=3 expected but generated 0? Wait, generated row2 [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] has 3 at col7, matches; actual diffs: row0 col1=3 extra; row3 col4=3 matches; unknown subtle misses in color 6 placements (row6 col12=0 expected 6? Generated row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] has 6 at col11,13 but expected row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] same—perhaps diff in row9 col1=0 expected 0); overall, left top extras and incomplete right fills.
 * Stem finding and base colors work well (preserves essentials in all trains), but key_col computation fails when uniform (shifts wrong, affecting anchors/clues); shape extraction captures deltas but orig_center calc assumes even span (//2 may floor unevenly).
 * Cleaning only middle left is helpful but misses top/bottom left preservation needs; mirroring and zeroing disrupt input right side too much.
 * No function for validating placements against frame or overlaps; extract_shape is essential for relative positioning but mid_col = (stem-1)//2 may misalign for narrow stems.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it has incomplete or misplaced shapes on the right (e.g., row3 has 1's clustered at col5-7 but sparse elsewhere, suggesting partial shape place for color 1, but expected likely fuller mirroring of left 1's in row12/13; row7/8/9 have isolated 4/6 but no horizontal extensions or multiples at clues like col12=3 positions); extras like row0 col1=1 (probably uncleaned left, similar to train failures); row13 has 7's only left, no right placement for color 7? (clues may include 7, but missing); row14 bottom has dense 9's but middle rows like row10/11 have sparse 9's/6's without full shape replication; zeroing cleared too much (e.g., row2 col6=1 isolated, but expected connected); mirroring to col19 seems partial (e.g., row0 col19=9 expected frame-like 9? but inconsistent); overall, placements miss vertical deltas (e.g., no downward from anchors for color 9 at row1/5), and secondary fills absent (e.g., no ±1 around clues for multiple anchors); does not make sense as it leaves right side too empty/sparse compared to left complexity, ignoring potential multi-clue alignments.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 13:51:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle-solving task where the goal is to generate Python code containing a required 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual patterns, objects, or puzzles) to produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input, simulating puzzle rules like object extraction, pattern matching, or grid manipulation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must include a 'program' function as the entry point; without it, all evaluations fail with an error, preventing any puzzle logic from executing.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid analysis, such as identifying objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, holes) in a 2D array of integers (possibly 0s for empty, 1s for filled cells), applying rules like counting connected components, omitting certain elements, or matching patterns.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure generated code handles varying grid sizes, edge cases like disconnected objects or asymmetric patterns, and exact output formatting (e.g., specific grid representations or lists); mismatches in shape, omission of dividers/keys, or incorrect blob identification could occur due to flawed extraction logic.
 * Considerations across attempts: No successful runs, so focus on basic structure first; mentally simulate rules on test input (unknown grid, but expected output should match puzzle semantics like object counts or transformed grids); avoid irrelevant functions that don't tie to grid processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the core 'program' function. Future attempts should prioritize defining 'program' to take inputs like grid lists and return puzzle-specific outputs (e.g., extracted features or solved grids).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1-3) and test input failed identically due to missing 'program' function, resulting in no puzzle processing or output generation.
 * No elements worked, as the code structure was invalid from the start; expected was valid code execution leading to correct puzzle outputs (e.g., matching training results), but observed only errors.
 * No object extraction or grid manipulation attempted, so no insights into puzzle rules like connected components or hole counting.
 * This attempt demonstrates zero progress on puzzle understanding, as even basic code validity was not achieved.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as it provides no puzzle solution or grid processing result.
 * Expected: A valid output based on test input grid rules (e.g., identified objects, transformed pattern, or numeric result matching puzzle semantics), but observed error means no simulation or matching possible; this blocks any verification of puzzle logic.
 * To handle test case, ensure 'program' function processes the specific test grid (unknown details, but likely requires object detection or rule application); current output is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where a central "stem" column (uniform non-zero color) anchors the structure, left-side elements are cleaned to base colors unique to that side, and rows are processed differently: top and bottom rows preserve complex patterns, while middle rows simplify by zeroing internal sections and propagating branch colors to edges or specific positions, likely to represent branching or object outlines without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The stem is a full-height column with a single uniform non-zero color; it's the anchor for left/right division, but not all grids may have it in the same position (e.g., varies across examples: col 4 in ex1, col 5 in ex2, col 4 in ex3).
 * Base colors are those appearing only on the left of the stem (not on right), used to clean extraneous colors from left columns, but this must preserve colors needed for branches; over-cleaning removes valid branch starters.
 * Top and bottom rows (first and last) must retain their full original complexity (e.g., multi-color sequences, blobs, or connected components), without simplification— the code's pass statement is correct but incomplete as prior steps already alter them incorrectly.
 * Middle rows (rows 1 to H-2) simplify drastically: zero out most internal columns (often from stem+1 to near-end), but propagate specific colors (e.g., adjacent to stem or branches) to the last column or targeted positions; branches may form horizontal or diagonal extensions that need to be "collapsed" or mirrored without losing identity.
 * Branches or objects extend from the stem in middle rows, often as single-color protrusions (e.g., a color C next to stem becomes a "branch" that sets the end column to C, but in examples, some branches have internal structure like repeated colors or skips that aren't fully zeroed).
 * Subtle: Not all middle rows have branches; some are just stem color propagated. Branches can be asymmetric or have gaps (e.g., in ex1 row3, a 4 appears in col9, surrounded by zeros). Right side after stem may have unique colors that influence propagation, but aren't base-cleaned.
 * Objects/blobs in top/bottom may connect across columns (e.g., runs of same color), and middle branches might "echo" these but simplified. Zeroing must avoid touching stem or ends prematurely.
 * Edge cases: Variable widths (14-20 cols), heights (10-12 rows); some rows have left-side prefixes (e.g., 8s in ex2 rows 3-5, 7s in ex3 row8) that aren't base colors but must persist if they're "supports" or separate objects.
 * Cleaning left columns only applies to non-base colors, but in practice, it wrongly zeros branch-relevant colors if they're shared right-side.
 * No vertical propagation assumed; each row independent post-stem ID, but patterns suggest horizontal connectivity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies the stem in all training examples (e.g., col4 color3 in ex1, col5 color3 in ex2, col4 color1 in ex3), and partially cleans left to focus on base-like colors.
 * What worked: Stem enforcement keeps vertical uniformity; simple middle row propagation sets ends correctly in uniform cases (e.g., ex1 rows1-2,5-6,8-9,11 end with 3 matching adjacent).
 * What didn't: Over-cleans left columns globally, zeroing valid non-base elements like 8s in ex2 left (expected preserves them as separate objects) and branch internals in ex1 row4 (generated all-zero middle, expected 4s in cols9-11).
 * In ex1: Generated zeros too much in middle rows with branches (row3: expected 4 at col9, but generated all zero except ends; row5: expected 4s cols9-11 +7s cols10-12? Wait, row5 expected [...,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,...3] but generated [...,4,0s,4]; row6 mismatches 7-branch). Top/bottom partially preserved but corrupted by prior cleaning (e.g., top row internals simplified wrongly).
 * In ex2: Left supports (8s in rows3-5) zeroed (generated zeros them, expected keeps 8s in left cols); middle branches not propagated correctly (row1 expected 7s in cols7,11 but generated zeros; row4 expected 5 at col9 but generated zero).
 * In ex3: Middle branches mishandled (row2 expected 3 at col7 but generated zero; row3 expected 3s cols6-8 but generated zeros; row6 expected 6 at col11 but generated zero; row7 expected 6s at cols10,12-13 but generated zero).
 * process_middle_rows assumes fixed branch at stem+1 and full zeroing to end-1, missing variable branch starts/widths (e.g., delayed branches, multi-col blobs).
 * find_base_colors subtracts all right colors, but branches may reuse colors row-locally; needs row-wise or object-based uniqueness.
 * No object extraction: Helpful for identifying branches as connected components (e.g., runs of same color from stem), but absent—would prevent over-zeroing blobs.
 * Top/bottom processing too late; cleaning/enforcing stem alters them before preservation.
 * Overall: Partial understanding of stem and row types, but misses branch detection/propagation and left-object persistence.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overly simplifies middle rows by zeroing everything after stem+1 except the last column (set to adjacent color), and applies cleaning that removes potential left objects/supports (e.g., 7s in row12 col1,3? Expected likely preserves them like ex2/ex3).
 * Mismatches expected patterns: Top row (row0) generated preserves complexity [0s,3,9s,1,9s,3,9s,4,6,9s,8,9] but prior cleaning might have altered it (similar to training); middle rows like row3 generated [...,1,0s,1] but expected probably has branch structure around 1 (e.g., repeated 1s or zeros with internal 1); row6 [...,3,0s,3] misses any branch (expected might have extension); row12 [0,7,0,7,3,1,0s,1] wrongly zeros left 7s (expected preserves as in ex3 row8). Bottom row (row14) generated [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9s,3,9s,4,6,9s,9,9] but likely corrupted by cleaning, missing full expected complexity. No sense of variable branch positions (e.g., 8 at row14 col6 suggests branch start, not propagated correctly). Overall, too uniform and zero-heavy, ignoring blob-like extensions seen in training expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a framed structure where shapes (identified by colors) on the left side of a dividing frame must be extracted, the left side cleared, anchors (colored cells in a specific post-frame column) mirrored to the right edge, and shapes sparsely placed/reconstructed on the right side guided by top-row clues, with rules for handling multiple anchors/clues and avoiding overfilling empty areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a vertical frame column (F) filled entirely with a single color (frame_color, e.g., 3 or 9) to identify the divider; everything left of F is the "source" for shapes, column S=F+1 holds anchors, top row from S to width-2 holds clues, and the right side (from S onward, excluding the rightmost mirror column) is where shapes get placed.
 * Shapes are extracted from the left (columns 0 to F-1) relative to a center column (mid_col = (F-1)//2), using delta_r and delta_c offsets to define their form; only shapes with matching anchors and clues are considered valid for placement.
 * Placement: Choose the anchor row closest to the shape's original center; start placing at the leftmost (min) clue position p in the top row; only fill if the target cell is empty (0); do not overwrite frame, anchors, or existing placements.
 * Clearing: The entire left side (0 to F-1) must be set to 0 for shapes that get placed, but frame (F) and anchors (S) remain; top/bottom rows often retain full structures, while middle rows should be sparse with many 0s.
 * Anchors: Non-frame colors in column S indicate rows where shapes of that color might anchor; if multiple anchors for a color, only one (closest to center) gets the full shape placement, others get "adjacent fills" (fill cells adjacent to clues, e.g., p-1, p, p+1 if empty).
 * Clues: Top-row non-frame colors from S to width-2; if multiple clues for a color, fill vertically downward from each clue position only in "protected" rows (e.g., the chosen anchor row and its upper offset row), but skip if the row is protected by other colors; single-clue colors don't trigger extra fills.
 * Mirroring: Copy anchors from S to the rightmost column (width-1) exactly.
 * Subtleties: Avoid overfilling—generated outputs fill entire rows/sections with frame_color or shape colors where expected has 0s (e.g., no filling in non-protected rows or outside shape deltas); shapes may have "holes" (0s inside), so extraction must preserve relative positions without assuming solidity; upper/lower offsets define protected rows for vertical clue fills, but only apply to multi-clue cases; if no anchors/clues match, skip placement entirely; frame detection assumes first full-color column is F, but may fail if no such column.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return unchanged; shapes without left cells or no matching anchors/clues are ignored; placements must respect grid bounds; top row clues may overlap with frame/anchors; in trains, bottom rows sometimes retain full shapes, suggesting asymmetric rules for row 0 and height-1.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Shape extraction logic is helpful: defines shapes as defaultdict(set) of delta_r to sets of delta_c, preserving relative positions and holes.
# Also computes orig_center, upper_offset, lower_offset for alignment and protection.
shapes = {}
for c in set(anchors.keys()) & set(clues.keys()):
    left_cells = [(r, col) for r in range(height) for col in range(F) if g[r][col] == c]
    if not left_cells:
        continue
    min_r = min(r for r, _ in left_cells)
    max_r = max(r for r, _ in left_cells)
    orig_center = min_r + (max_r - min_r) // 2
    upper_offset = orig_center - min_r
    lower_offset = max_r - orig_center
    shape = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for r, col in left_cells:
        delta_r = r - orig_center
        delta_c = col - mid_col
        shape[delta_r].add(delta_c)
    shapes[c] = (shape, orig_center, upper_offset, lower_offset)
```

```python
# Anchor and clue extraction is essential: anchors from column S, clues from top row S to width-2.
anchors = collections.defaultdict(list)
for r in range(height):
    c = g[r][S]
    if c > 0 and c != frame_color:
        anchors[c].append(r)

clues = collections.defaultdict(list)
for p in range(S, width - 1):
    c = g[0][p]
    if c > 0 and c != frame_color:
        clues[c].append(p)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Frame detection works: correctly identifies F and frame_color (e.g., 3 in train1, places mirror in rightmost column accurately).
 * Shape extraction works partially: relative deltas capture shape forms (e.g., in train1, the 4/7/6 placements in middle rows match expected positions), and clearing left side for placed shapes is done, but top/bottom rows aren't exempted from clearing, leading to partial overwrites.
 * Anchor selection works: chooses closest to orig_center, enabling correct primary placements (e.g., train1 row 5 for 4, row 7 for 7, row 10 for 6).
 * Placement at min(p) with deltas works for core shape: sparse fills in right side match expected in some spots (e.g., train1 row 4: [4,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,...] vs expected similar but with more 0s).
 * Mirroring anchors to rightmost column works fully across all trains.
 * Skipped anchors adjacent fill partially works but over-applies: in train3, fills some adjacent but generates extra 2s where expected has 0s (e.g., row 1: full 2s vs sparse).
 * Clue single fills for multi-ps is broken: overfills vertically in non-protected rows with shape color (e.g., train1 rows 1-3,8-11 filled with 3s where expected 0s; logic skips only if row protected but c not in protectors, but applies too broadly, filling if condition fails incorrectly).
 * Protected rows (upper/center) concept is good but inverted/buggy: adds c to row_to_protecting for upper_pr and center_pr, but then in fills: "if r in row_to_protecting and c not in row_to_protecting[r]: continue" skips fills in protected rows if c isn't protecting it, but expected has fills ONLY in protected rows for multi-clues—logic should fill IF c in protectors, not skip otherwise; causes under/over-filling (e.g., train2 row 1: fills 4s where expected 0s/7s sparse).
 * Overfilling with frame_color (e.g., 3 or 9) in empty right areas: generated treats many 0s as fillable, but expected keeps 0s outside shapes/clues/anchors (e.g., train1 row 1: full 3s vs [3,0,0,0,...3]; unknown if due to missing bound checks or wrong fill condition).
 * Multi-clue handling incomplete: for colors like 3 in train1 (multiple clues?), fills too much vertically without restricting to protected rows only.
 * Left clearing too aggressive: clears all left for any c in shapes, but expected retains some left structures? Wait, no—expected clears most left to 0s, but generated sometimes leaves uncleared (e.g., train1 row 0 has 2,3,6,4,7 but expected same, so top row not cleared—code clears all rows 0-F, but out = copy then clear, yet top/bottom match input, suggesting code doesn't overwrite top/bottom? Actually, code clears all, but in generated row 0 matches expected, maybe input has it).
 * No handling for bottom row retention: expected often keeps bottom full like top, but code places/sparsifies it.
 * Function for frame finding is helpful but assumes first full column >0; works for trains but may miss if frame not first.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it overfills large sections of the right side with 9s (likely frame_color) in rows 1,2,5,11,13,14 where expected should have sparse placements and many 0s (similar to train patterns, e.g., row 1 should likely be sparse 9s only at clue/anchor positions, not full rows); placements like row 7 [3,4,0,0,...4] seem partially correct but surrounded by extra 9s; row 9 has 6s placed but extra 0-fills missing sparsity; row 12 has 1s and 7s but overfills 9s in non-shape areas; overall, mirrors anchors correctly (e.g., rightmost column has 3s), but clue-driven vertical fills are too broad, ignoring protected row restrictions and creating solid blocks instead of isolated shapes; does not account for multi-clue colors (e.g., possible multiple 9s or 3s) needing only protected fills, leading to invalid density.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving colored grids (numbers as colors) where the left side contains structural elements like support stems, base colors, and object shapes, while the right side uses top-row clues and anchor positions to mirror or replicate transformed versions of those left-side shapes, often with cleaning of non-essential colors in middle rows and specific placement rules to avoid overlaps or frame interference.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a left "support stem" (uniform non-zero column, often the leftmost), followed by a "main stem" column that acts as a frame or divider, uniform or dominant in a frame color (e.g., appearing >H//2 times, matching top/bottom).
 * Base colors are those unique to the left of the main stem (not appearing on the right at all in input), used to preserve only relevant left-side elements; middle rows (1 to H-2) on the left must be cleaned to remove non-base colors, but top/bottom rows stay intact.
 * Shapes are extracted from the left side per color C (non-frame, non-zero), using relative deltas from a center row and mid-column ((stem_col-1)//2), capturing the "form" of objects like branches or blobs.
 * Clues are non-frame colors in the top row (row 0) from key_col (stem or stem+1 if uniform) to W-2; anchors are similar colors in the key_col for middle rows.
 * Placement: For each color C with both clues and anchors, select a primary anchor (closest to the shape's original center row); place the full shape (all deltas) aligned to that primary anchor row and each clue column on the right (key_col+1 to W-2), but skip positive delta_r (downward extensions) if the original center is above the primary anchor to avoid "upside-down" or incomplete mirroring; for secondary anchors (other rows with C in key_col), only fill horizontal adjacents (±1 column) at clue positions, not full shapes.
 * Right side mirroring: Set the rightmost column (W-1) to copy the key_col values for all rows; zero out inner right middle rows (key_col+1 to W-2, rows 1 to H-2) initially to clear space before placements.
 * Subtleties: Frame color (main stem's mode) must not be placed as a shape; empty shapes (no left cells for C) skip all placements for that C; placements only if target cell is empty and within bounds; shapes may be asymmetric vertically (e.g., tree-like branches extending more up or down); if stem is uniform, key_col shifts right to stem+1 for anchors/clues; top/bottom rows on right may retain or copy frame elements but not get shape fills in middle.
 * Overlaps/priorities: Placements only on empty cells, so order matters (colors processed in dict order, which is insertion order); no overwriting existing non-zero cells.
 * Edge cases: No left stem (start from col 0); no main stem (error, but assume always present); colors appearing both sides aren't base; horizontal fills for secondaries are limited to clue ±1, not full rows.
 * All rows/columns 0-indexed; H = rows, W = columns assumed rectangular.

```
(These are helpful for identifying placement targets but assume post-cleaning grid; they ignore frame color correctly.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `set_mirror_column`: Overly simplistic; it copies key_col to W-1 unconditionally, but expected outputs show W-1 often mirrors frame or specific colors selectively (e.g., in train1 row0, it's 3 not copying extras; causes unwanted fills like extra 4 in train1 row0 col1? Wait, col1 is left, but mirroring affects right).
- `zero_inner_right_middle`: Clears too aggressively before placements, but in expected, some right inner cells retain input values if not overwritten (e.g., train2 row1 col7 should be 7 from input, but generated has 0).
- `place_primary_shape` and `place_secondary_fills`: Logic for skipping positive delta_r is inverted or misapplied (e.g., in train1 for color 7, it places full shape at secondary row7 instead of just horizontal fill, leading to extra 7's? But actually in generated row7 has 7's like expected—wait, differences elsewhere); doesn't handle multiple primaries or vertical alignment precisely.
- `place_shapes`: Processes colors in arbitrary order (dict keys), causing overwrite issues; skips empty shapes correctly but doesn't handle cases where anchors exist without clues or vice versa.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of placement rules, especially shape replication and cleaning.
 * Train 1: Generated has extra 4 in row0 col1 (should be 0, perhaps from uncleaned left or mirror leak); row7 incorrectly places full shape for color 7 at what should be secondary anchor (but actually matches expected there—difference is subtle: row8 generated has no 7's in col9-11, expected has them? Wait, generated row7 is [...,7,7,7,...] but expected row7 [...,7,7,7,...] same; actual diff in row0 left extras and possibly missing downward extensions for color 4 in row5 col9=4 expected but generated has it? Upon close check, main diffs: generated row0 col1=4 (extra, not cleaned/mirrored wrong); row4 col18=4 (matches); but row11 col1=0 expected 0; unknown why left top not cleaned fully.
 * Train 2: Generated misses several 7's in right inner columns for middle rows (e.g., row1 col7=0 expected 7; row3 col7=0 expected 7; row6 col7=0 expected 7; row8 col7=7 matches but row8 col8=0 expected 7?); over-places 5's or 8's wrongly (e.g., row4 col8=0 expected 0, but row5 col8=5 expected 0? Wait, generated row5 [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5] has extra 5's at col7,9 vs expected [0,0,8,0,3,5,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,5] missing col7/9 0's); suggests secondary fills too broad or primary shape misaligned for color 5/7.
 * Train 3: Generated has extra 3 in row0 col1 (should be 0, similar to train1 left unclean); row8 left has 7,7,7 in col0-2 (expected same? Wait matches); but misses placements for color 3 in row2 col7=3 expected but generated 0? Wait, generated row2 [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2] has 3 at col7, matches; actual diffs: row0 col1=3 extra; row3 col4=3 matches; unknown subtle misses in color 6 placements (row6 col12=0 expected 6? Generated row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] has 6 at col11,13 but expected row6 [0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6] same—perhaps diff in row9 col1=0 expected 0); overall, left top extras and incomplete right fills.
 * Stem finding and base colors work well (preserves essentials in all trains), but key_col computation fails when uniform (shifts wrong, affecting anchors/clues); shape extraction captures deltas but orig_center calc assumes even span (//2 may floor unevenly).
 * Cleaning only middle left is helpful but misses top/bottom left preservation needs; mirroring and zeroing disrupt input right side too much.
 * No function for validating placements against frame or overlaps; extract_shape is essential for relative positioning but mid_col = (stem-1)//2 may misalign for narrow stems.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it has incomplete or misplaced shapes on the right (e.g., row3 has 1's clustered at col5-7 but sparse elsewhere, suggesting partial shape place for color 1, but expected likely fuller mirroring of left 1's in row12/13; row7/8/9 have isolated 4/6 but no horizontal extensions or multiples at clues like col12=3 positions); extras like row0 col1=1 (probably uncleaned left, similar to train failures); row13 has 7's only left, no right placement for color 7? (clues may include 7, but missing); row14 bottom has dense 9's but middle rows like row10/11 have sparse 9's/6's without full shape replication; zeroing cleared too much (e.g., row2 col6=1 isolated, but expected connected); mirroring to col19 seems partial (e.g., row0 col19=9 expected frame-like 9? but inconsistent); overall, placements miss vertical deltas (e.g., no downward from anchors for color 9 at row1/5), and secondary fills absent (e.g., no ±1 around clues for multiple anchors); does not make sense as it leaves right side too empty/sparse compared to left complexity, ignoring potential multi-clue alignments.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 14:12:46] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving a framed structure with a central "stem" column of a uniform frame color, where the left side contains unique "base" shapes or objects that need to be identified, cleaned, and mirrored or placed onto the right side based on "anchors" (from middle rows) and "clues" (from the top row), while zeroing out irrelevant areas and enforcing symmetry or specific placements. The goal is to transform the input grid into a completed output by extracting, matching, and positioning these elements without overlapping or altering the frame/stem.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify the stem column as the one where the most common non-zero color appears in more than half the rows and matches top/bottom borders; this supersedes other columns and uses that color as the frame_color.
 * Base colors are unique to the left side (before stem) and not present on the right; clean the left side to only retain these base colors, zeroing others, while preserving the stem but enforcing frame_color where it should be uniform.
 * Right side handling: Mirror a "key" column (stem or next if uniform) to the last column; zero out inner right areas (between key_col+1 and W-2) in middle rows (1 to H-2) to prepare for placements.
 * Anchors are non-zero, non-frame colors in the key_col of middle rows; clues are non-zero, non-frame colors in top row from key_col to W-2; match common colors between anchors and clues to trigger placements.
 * Shape extraction from left: For each matching color C, find cells on left, compute a center (midpoint of min/max row), relative dr/dc from mid_col (stem-1//2), build shape as sets of dc per dr; select "widest_dr" as the one with max len(shape[dr]), ties broken by smallest |dr| then smallest dr.
 * Placement logic: For each anchor row and clue col for C, optionally flip shape if widest_dr >0 (by negating dr and shifting by widest_dr), then place only for |dr|<=1 (limited to adjacent/single rows?); add missing adjacent singles (dr=±1, dc=0) if not placed; ensure placements are in bounds, middle rows, inner right, and on zero cells.
 * Subtleties: Placements are restricted to |dr|<=1 in the code, which may miss taller shapes; flipping/shifting assumes vertical symmetry but only applies if widest_dr>0; no handling for multi-wide shapes beyond dc sets; anchors/clues must overlap in colors exactly; left cleaning happens before shape extraction but uses original g for cells; if no stem found, return copy of input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Uniform stem leads to key_col = stem+1; if key_col >=W, skip mirroring/zeroing/placements; shapes with abs(dr)>1 are skipped in placement (only adjacent); no overlap checks beyond zero cells; base_colors subtraction ensures left uniqueness but may miss if colors overlap subtly.
 * Potential misses: Code enforces stem to frame_color only if original != frame_color (buggy?); placements don't fill full shape if >1 dr; mid_col calculation assumes even/odd stem positioning; no rotation or scaling of shapes, only flip/shift; clues/anchors are lists per color, but placement loops over all combinations without prioritization.

```
(Note: The shape extraction function above is adapted from the attempt's logic and is helpful for isolating object shapes; the full placement with flip/shift is useful but limited to |dr|<=1, which may need extension for taller objects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core logic for stem detection, left cleaning, base color identification, mirroring, zeroing inner right, and basic anchor/clue matching works for those cases.
 * Worked: Stem/frame detection via mode/count with border match; base_colors subtraction to isolate left uniques; enforcement of stem uniformity; extraction of anchors/clues as lists per color; shape building with dr/dc relatives and widest_dr selection with tiebreakers.
 * Worked: Optional flip/shift for shapes when widest_dr>0; placement looping over anchor/clue pairs; bounding to middle rows/inner right/zero cells; adding missing adjacent singles for dc=0.
 * Didn't work fully: Placement skips dr with abs(dr)>1, potentially missing vertical extent of shapes (only places |dr|<=1 + adjacents); no overlap resolution if multiple C placements conflict; stem enforcement sets to frame_color only if original != frame_color, which may preserve anomalies incorrectly.
 * Subtle bug: In stem enforcement, "if g[i][stem_col] != frame_color: out[i][stem_col] = g[i][stem_col] else: out[i][stem_col] = frame_color" – this redundantly sets non-frame to itself and frame to frame, but should probably force all to frame_color for uniformity (current code doesn't zero or alter non-frame in stem).
 * No previous unhelpful functions noted, but the raw placement loop is overly restrictive (only |dr|<=1) and may not handle complex shapes; widest_dr tiebreaker uses min with key=(-len, abs(dr), dr), which correctly picks max len then min |dr| then min dr.
 * Training examples all correct, suggesting the logic handles simple shapes/anchors well, but may fail on test due to taller/multi-dr shapes or color overlaps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (15x20 grid) shows a stem in column 4 (all 3s, frame_color=3), with left side partially cleaned (e.g., row 3 has 1s in cols 5-8 but col5 is stem? Wait, stem=4, so cols 0-3 zeroed, cols5+ are right but output has left-like placements? – inconsistency, as cleaning should zero non-base in 0-3, but row0 has no left fills).
 * Observed: Top row (row0) retains original-like [0,0,0,0,3,9,9,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,8,9], not zeroed inner right, suggesting mirroring/zeroing partially applied but top row exempt (correct per code, as zeroing skips row0/H-1).
 * Middle rows show some placements, e.g., row3: [0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] – 1s placed right after stem, but also in col19=1 (mirrored?); row7: [0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,4] with 4s appearing, likely from anchor/clue matching.
 * Issues: Right side not fully zeroed in inners (e.g., row0 has many non-zeros beyond key_col, but code only zeros middle rows); placements seem sparse, e.g., color 6 in row9 col15/16/18? but code limits to |dr|<=1, so may miss wider/taller; last column (19) has mirrors like 9,1,9,1,... but inconsistent with key_col (likely 5, since stem=4 uniform? – code sets key_col=stem+1=5 if uniform).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected more symmetric/complete placements for colors like 1,4,6 based on left shapes (e.g., row3/12 have 1s on left, should mirror full horizontal bar to right clues/anchors), but output has fragmented 1s (e.g., row3 cols5-8=1 but col19=1, missing fills); color 9 treated as frame? but appears in right, not cleaned; row14 (bottom?) has [0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9] with extras like 7s on left (not base-cleaned?) and 8/1 placements, suggesting partial shape matching but incomplete (e.g., no full mirroring of left 7s in row12/13/14); overall, output has uncleared non-base on left (7s) and sparse right fills, differing from expected clean left + full mirrored shapes on right.
 * Unknown why 9s persist in right inners of middle rows (e.g., row1 col19=9, but col5=9? – if key_col=5, mirror out[i][19]=out[i][5], but zeroing should clear cols6-18 in middle; code zeros key+1 to W-2, so col19 safe, but if 9 is not base, why not zeroed earlier? – perhaps 9 is a clue/anchor color placed back).
