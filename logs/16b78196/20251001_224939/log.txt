=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 22:49:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:05:51] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-8 representing colors), where connected components of the same color form "objects" that must be rearranged: identify the largest object as the "base," attempt to fit smaller objects into empty spaces ("holes") within or around the base without overlapping, and stack any unfitted objects below the base in a stable, column-based manner (like Tetris stacking), ensuring no overlaps and respecting grid boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * The base is always the largest (by cell count) connected component; if ties, the code picks by index, but this may need sorting by size first.
 * "Holes" likely refer to empty (0) cells enclosed by or adjacent to the base, but the current implementation incorrectly includes all neighboring cells (even occupied ones) without verifying emptiness, leading to invalid placement targets.
 * Placement into holes requires translating the entire small object rigidly (preserving relative positions) so its anchor (top-left cell) aligns with a hole, ensuring no out-of-bounds, no overlaps with existing blocks (including base), and possibly only within the base's row/column span for "fitting."
 * If no hole fit, stack below: align under the base's column range (e.g., min to max column, or a fixed width like 6), compute a "skyline" of the highest occupied row per column below the base, drop the object to rest on the skyline without overlaps, and update the skyline.
 * Subtlety: Stacking may require sorting small objects by color or size; current code sorts below_components by color, but expected outputs suggest placement order affects stability (e.g., larger first or by anchor position).
 * Grid is 30x30, but objects are small; ensure placements don't wrap or go out of bounds.
 * Expected outputs show complete rearrangement: small objects are either embedded in base (e.g., filling gaps with matching shapes) or stacked neatly below in a compact formation, often with empty space above and around.
 * Overlaps must be strictly avoided, even with non-base objects; clearing original positions before placing is correct, but current code only clears if placed.
 * Potential miss: Base may have irregular shapes, so holes aren't simple perimeters—true holes are enclosed empties (use flood-fill from edges to find internal voids).
 * Anchors: Using top-left (min row, min col in that row) is reasonable but may fail for irregular shapes; relative deltas must preserve object connectivity and shape exactly.
 * Sorting small components: Current sort by min row then min col may not match expected order (e.g., by color, size, or left-to-right).
 * Skyline for stacking: Current implementation initializes to base_max_r but should start from base bottom +1; it scans downward for existing blocks (but in examples, below is empty), and places by max height per relative column— but arbitrary width (base_min_c to min(base_max_c, base_min_c+6)) limits stacking incorrectly.
 * In examples, stacked objects are often shifted left or centered under base, not rigidly at block_min.
 * Colors must be preserved; no recoloring.
 * If no components, return unchanged (correct edge case).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import copy

def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # This function correctly identifies 4-way connected components of same color, returning list of (color, list of (r,c) positions).
    # Useful for extracting all objects; visited matrix prevents revisits; stack-based DFS is efficient for 30x30.
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    visited = [[False] * 30 for _ in range(30)]
    components = []
    for i in range(30):
        for j in range(30):
            if g[i][j] > 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```

```python
def get_anchor(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Correctly finds top-left anchor (min row, then min col in that row); useful for translation reference.
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely.
 * Correctly identifies components and base (largest by size), and attempts hole-fitting and below-stacking logic, showing partial understanding of rearrangement.
 * get_holes is broken/not helpful: it collects all adjacent cells to base (including non-empty and external), without checking for actual empty holes, leading to invalid placements; do not use as-is—replace with flood-fill for internal empties or perimeter empties only.
 * Hole placement loop checks bounds and overlaps correctly (good), but since holes are wrong, no placements succeed, pushing everything to stacking.
 * Stacking sorts by color (may be wrong—expected seems by position or size), uses arbitrary width limit (6 cols, ignores full base width), and skyline init/scanning assumes blocks below base (but examples are empty), resulting in misaligned drops.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps most blocks in original positions (e.g., 8's large base intact but with intrusions like misplaced 6's and 3's), adds junk like isolated 4's/2's/1's low; expected rearranges small objects into base gaps (e.g., 1's and 2's fill top of 6's area, 3's/4's stack below in compact L-shapes) and clears originals—mismatch in all small object positions, base unchanged except minor overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated leaves 2's base mostly intact with intrusions (e.g., 1's/3's/4's embedded wrongly), empties some but doesn't stack below properly; expected drops 1's/3's/4's below base in a stacked tower (e.g., 3's on bottom, 4's/1's above, shifted left)—mismatch in embedding (overlaps base) and no below stacking, originals not cleared.
 * get_anchor and component extraction are essential and correct—keep them.
 * Overall, demonstrates core idea of base + fit/stack but misses hole detection, placement validation, stacking alignment/width, and clearing logic subtlety (only clears if placed, but fails to place).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be mostly unchanged from what seems like the input (based on patterns: large 3's vertical/horizontal spans, 1's/4's/8's/6's/2's in clusters), with no evident rearrangement—small objects like 1's, 2's, 6's are still in upper/mid positions, not fitted into the apparent base (likely the large 3's or 8's) or stacked below.
 * It does not look correct: Expected should show small components (e.g., the compact 1's, 2's, 6's groups) either embedded in gaps of the base (e.g., filling voids in 3's or 8's structures) or dropped below in a skyline-stable stack under the base's columns, with originals cleared to 0; here, everything remains in place with possible minor shifts (e.g., 2's still low-right), suggesting failed fitting/stacking like in training.
 * Missing: Cleared originals, no stacking below (bottom rows still sparse), potential overlaps if any movement occurred (hard to tell without input, but pattern unchanged); does not compact or reorganize as in expected training outputs.
 * To handle test: Ensure full base width for stacking (not arbitrary 6), proper empty hole detection (e.g., only 0-cells adjacent/internal), sort smalls by size descending for stable stacking, and verify placements update out grid fully.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 23:05:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.


[2025-10-01 23:16:09] Response:
```python
from typing import List

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 23:16:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids (though many rows are empty) where cells contain integers (0 for empty, 1-8 for colored or typed "objects" forming connected shapes or blobs), and the goal is to transform the input grid into a new output grid by identifying, extracting, and repositioning these objects according to specific rules—likely involving sorting by type/number, aligning them in a canonical order (e.g., top-to-bottom by number, left-justified), preserving shape but relocating them, and filling empty space with 0s, while possibly merging or modifying interactions between overlapping or adjacent blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects appear to be 4-connected or 8-connected groups (blobs) of the same number; e.g., in training example 1, the 4's form a cross-like shape that gets relocated intact to the bottom, the 3's form a partial square that moves down, the 6's become a horizontal bar with 1's integrated, and 8's form a large background with embedded 2's and 3's adjusted.
 * Relocation seems rule-based: blobs are extracted and placed in a sorted order (lowest to highest number?) starting from the top or bottom, but with position-specific adjustments—e.g., in training 1 expected, low numbers (1,2,6) go to rows 9-14, 8's to 14-18 with embeds, 3/4's to bottom rows 19-29; in training 2, 1's go to top, 2's stay mid with embeds, 3/4's to bottom.
 * Subtle elements: Blobs may overlap or embed during relocation (e.g., 2's inside 8's in train 1, 1's inside 2's and 3's in train 2); empty rows are preserved or collapsed minimally; shapes must retain exact connectivity and size but can rotate/flip? (no evidence yet); numbers indicate type, and 0s are background—overwriting rules prioritize higher/lower numbers? Unknown if diagonal connectivity counts.
 * Interactions: In expected outputs, some blobs are "cut" or modified (e.g., train 1 generated has intact 4's in top but expected clears them to 0s and moves elsewhere; train 2 generated keeps 1's partial but expected integrates 1's into 2's and adds 3/4 below).
 * Grid size/consistency: Always 30 rows x 30 cols; many rows all-0s, but outputs preserve structure without unnecessary padding.
 * Potential misses: Identity copy ignores all transformations; no blob detection means shapes stay in original positions; sorting order unclear (by min number? size? appearance order?); embedding rules subtle (e.g., 3's replace some 8's in train 1 row 18).
 * All considerations: Use flood-fill for blob extraction; track blob type, bounding box, and relative positions; possible canonical placement like stacking vertically by type; handle multi-blob same-type merges? (not seen); test for rotation (e.g., 4's vertical in input become horizontal? No, seem preserved).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions in this attempt—the program is a simple identity copy, which doesn't extract or manipulate anything.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (identity copy) failed both training examples completely by returning the input unchanged, missing all transformations like clearing upper shapes to 0s, relocating blobs (e.g., train 1: generated keeps 4's/3's in rows 3-6 but expected clears to all-0s and moves 6/1/2 to rows 9-14, 3/4 to 19-29; train 2: generated keeps 1's in rows 1-4 and 3's partial in 22-25 but expected integrates 1's into 2's at row 13, places 3/4 stacked at 15-20).
 * What worked: Nothing substantive—copy preserves grid structure and 0s, but that's trivial and irrelevant.
 * What didn't work: No object detection or movement, so all blobs stay in place (e.g., train 1 generated has 8's intact in rows 14-18 but expected embeds 2's and adjusts 3's; differences unknown but clearly positional); ignores sorting/relocation rules, leading to mismatches in 90%+ of non-0 cells.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this demonstrates zero understanding—no functions for blob extraction (essential for identifying connected groups like the 4-cross or 3-L shapes).
 * Function `program` (identity copy) is broken and not helpful—don't use it; replace with blob-flood-fill logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of an input grid with 3's forming a large vertical/horizontal structure across rows 0-29 (e.g., solid 3-bars in cols 9-15), 4's scattered in rows 4-7, 8's in row 3 cols 18-21 and row 5 cols 19-22, 6's building left in rows 14-17, 2's in rows 17-20 cols 21-24, 1's in row 25 cols 23, but with no transformations.
 * It does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no clearing of upper 3/4/8 to 0s and restacking by type; 6's/2's/1's not integrated or moved up; 3's not condensed to bottom). Looks incorrect because it retains original positions without relocation/embedding (e.g., 3's dominate mid-grid but should likely be sorted/aligned like train 2's 3/4 stack); unclear why 6's build incrementally leftward or 2's appear partial—probably input copy, not rule-applied.

[2025-10-01 23:16:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

 * This attempt (identity copy) failed both training examples completely by returning the input unchanged, missing all transformations like clearing upper shapes to 0s, relocating blobs (e.g., train 1: generated keeps 4's/3's in rows 3-6 but expected clears to all-0s and moves 6/1/2 to rows 9-14, 3/4 to 19-29; train 2: generated keeps 1's in rows 1-4 and 3's partial in 22-25 but expected integrates 1's into 2's at row 13, places 3/4 stacked at 15-20).
 * What worked: Nothing substantive—copy preserves grid structure and 0s, but that's trivial and irrelevant.
 * What didn't work: No object detection or movement, so all blobs stay in place (e.g., train 1 generated has 8's intact in rows 14-18 but expected embeds 2's and adjusts 3's; differences unknown but clearly positional); ignores sorting/relocation rules, leading to mismatches in 90%+ of non-0 cells.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this demonstrates zero understanding—no functions for blob extraction (essential for identifying connected groups like the 4-cross or 3-L shapes).
 * Function `program` (identity copy) is broken and not helpful—don't use it; replace with blob-flood-fill logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of an input grid with 3's forming a large vertical/horizontal structure across rows 0-29 (e.g., solid 3-bars in cols 9-15), 4's scattered in rows 4-7, 8's in row 3 cols 18-21 and row 5 cols 19-22, 6's building left in rows 14-17, 2's in rows 17-20 cols 21-24, 1's in row 25 cols 23, but with no transformations.
 * It does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no clearing of upper 3/4/8 to 0s and restacking by type; 6's/2's/1's not integrated or moved up; 3's not condensed to bottom). Looks incorrect because it retains original positions without relocation/embedding (e.g., 3's dominate mid-grid but should likely be sorted/aligned like train 2's 3/4 stack); unclear why 6's build incrementally leftward or 2's appear partial—probably input copy, not rule-applied.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-8 representing colors), where connected components of the same color form "objects" that must be rearranged: identify the largest object as the "base," attempt to fit smaller objects into empty spaces ("holes") within or around the base without overlapping, and stack any unfitted objects below the base in a stable, column-based manner (like Tetris stacking), ensuring no overlaps and respecting grid boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * The base is always the largest (by cell count) connected component; if ties, the code picks by index, but this may need sorting by size first.
 * "Holes" likely refer to empty (0) cells enclosed by or adjacent to the base, but the current implementation incorrectly includes all neighboring cells (even occupied ones) without verifying emptiness, leading to invalid placement targets.
 * Placement into holes requires translating the entire small object rigidly (preserving relative positions) so its anchor (top-left cell) aligns with a hole, ensuring no out-of-bounds, no overlaps with existing blocks (including base), and possibly only within the base's row/column span for "fitting."
 * If no hole fit, stack below: align under the base's column range (e.g., min to max column, or a fixed width like 6), compute a "skyline" of the highest occupied row per column below the base, drop the object to rest on the skyline without overlaps, and update the skyline.
 * Subtlety: Stacking may require sorting small objects by color or size; current code sorts below_components by color, but expected outputs suggest placement order affects stability (e.g., larger first or by anchor position).
 * Grid is 30x30, but objects are small; ensure placements don't wrap or go out of bounds.
 * Expected outputs show complete rearrangement: small objects are either embedded in base (e.g., filling gaps with matching shapes) or stacked neatly below in a compact formation, often with empty space above and around.
 * Overlaps must be strictly avoided, even with non-base objects; clearing original positions before placing is correct, but current code only clears if placed.
 * Potential miss: Base may have irregular shapes, so holes aren't simple perimeters—true holes are enclosed empties (use flood-fill from edges to find internal voids).
 * Anchors: Using top-left (min row, min col in that row) is reasonable but may fail for irregular shapes; relative deltas must preserve object connectivity and shape exactly.
 * Sorting small components: Current sort by min row then min col may not match expected order (e.g., by color, size, or left-to-right).
 * Skyline for stacking: Current implementation initializes to base_max_r but should start from base bottom +1; it scans downward for existing blocks (but in examples, below is empty), and places by max height per relative column— but arbitrary width (base_min_c to min(base_max_c, base_min_c+6)) limits stacking incorrectly.
 * In examples, stacked objects are often shifted left or centered under base, not rigidly at block_min.
 * Colors must be preserved; no recoloring.
 * If no components, return unchanged (correct edge case).

def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # This function correctly identifies 4-way connected components of same color, returning list of (color, list of (r,c) positions).
    # Useful for extracting all objects; visited matrix prevents revisits; stack-based DFS is efficient for 30x30.
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    visited = [[False] * 30 for _ in range(30)]
    components = []

                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```

```python
def get_anchor(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Correctly finds top-left anchor (min row, then min col in that row); useful for translation reference.
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely.
 * Correctly identifies components and base (largest by size), and attempts hole-fitting and below-stacking logic, showing partial understanding of rearrangement.
 * get_holes is broken/not helpful: it collects all adjacent cells to base (including non-empty and external), without checking for actual empty holes, leading to invalid placements; do not use as-is—replace with flood-fill for internal empties or perimeter empties only.
 * Hole placement loop checks bounds and overlaps correctly (good), but since holes are wrong, no placements succeed, pushing everything to stacking.
 * Stacking sorts by color (may be wrong—expected seems by position or size), uses arbitrary width limit (6 cols, ignores full base width), and skyline init/scanning assumes blocks below base (but examples are empty), resulting in misaligned drops.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps most blocks in original positions (e.g., 8's large base intact but with intrusions like misplaced 6's and 3's), adds junk like isolated 4's/2's/1's low; expected rearranges small objects into base gaps (e.g., 1's and 2's fill top of 6's area, 3's/4's stack below in compact L-shapes) and clears originals—mismatch in all small object positions, base unchanged except minor overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated leaves 2's base mostly intact with intrusions (e.g., 1's/3's/4's embedded wrongly), empties some but doesn't stack below properly; expected drops 1's/3's/4's below base in a stacked tower (e.g., 3's on bottom, 4's/1's above, shifted left)—mismatch in embedding (overlaps base) and no below stacking, originals not cleared.
 * get_anchor and component extraction are essential and correct—keep them.
 * Overall, demonstrates core idea of base + fit/stack but misses hole detection, placement validation, stacking alignment/width, and clearing logic subtlety (only clears if placed, but fails to place).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be mostly unchanged from what seems like the input (based on patterns: large 3's vertical/horizontal spans, 1's/4's/8's/6's/2's in clusters), with no evident rearrangement—small objects like 1's, 2's, 6's are still in upper/mid positions, not fitted into the apparent base (likely the large 3's or 8's) or stacked below.
 * It does not look correct: Expected should show small components (e.g., the compact 1's, 2's, 6's groups) either embedded in gaps of the base (e.g., filling voids in 3's or 8's structures) or dropped below in a skyline-stable stack under the base's columns, with originals cleared to 0; here, everything remains in place with possible minor shifts (e.g., 2's still low-right), suggesting failed fitting/stacking like in training.
 * Missing: Cleared originals, no stacking below (bottom rows still sparse), potential overlaps if any movement occurred (hard to tell without input, but pattern unchanged); does not compact or reorganize as in expected training outputs.
 * To handle test: Ensure full base width for stacking (not arbitrary 6), proper empty hole detection (e.g., only 0-cells adjacent/internal), sort smalls by size descending for stable stacking, and verify placements update out grid fully.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 23:31:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color) and rearrange them into a new grid by selecting the largest component as a base and attaching smaller components adjacent to it (touching via edges) or stacking them above/below to form a coherent, possibly stacked or assembled structure, while preserving the relative shapes of each component. The output must match an expected reconfiguration that connects components logically without overlaps, often repositioning them to build upward or fill spaces near the base.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (only orthogonal neighbors: up, down, left, right; no diagonals), so blobs must be extracted using flood-fill or stack-based traversal to group same-color pixels correctly.
 * The largest component (by pixel count, with color as tiebreaker) is always placed as the "base" in its original position, serving as an anchor for attaching others; smaller components must be translated (shifted rigidly, preserving shape) to touch the base or existing structure via at least one edge pixel, but cannot overlap or go out of bounds.
 * Placement prioritizes proximity to the base (searching in a bounded window around the base's bounding box, e.g., ±5 cells), requiring adjacency check after fitting; if no adjacent spot fits, try placing above the base (scanning rows from top to base's min row); fallback to original positions only if nothing works, but this often fails as the puzzle expects full reassembly.
 * Sorting smaller components by descending size (then color) ensures larger attachments go first, but this can block smaller ones if not careful; subtle issue: adjacency must be to any existing placed pixel (not just base), so update the "out" grid iteratively.
 * Anchor point for placement is the top-left (min row, then min col in that row) of each component, used for relative shifting (dr, dc); this works for top-aligned fitting but may miss rotations or flips (puzzle likely forbids them, as shapes must stay intact).
 * Grids have lots of empty space (0s), and components don't wrap around edges; expected outputs often "stack" vertically (e.g., smaller blobs on top of base like a tower) or fill gaps, but horizontal spreading is possible if adjacent.
 * Easy to miss: Overly restrictive search windows (e.g., only ±5 around base) prevent valid placements far away; adjacency check must scan all 4 directions from every pixel in the proposed position, not just the anchor.
 * Fallback to original positions pollutes the output with scattered blobs, which mismatches expectations where everything connects into one structure.
 * Colors must stay the same; no recoloring or merging different colors.
 * In expectations, disconnected original components get connected in output, suggesting the puzzle is about reassembly like a jigsaw or block-stacking game.

                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```
(This flood-fill function correctly extracts 4-connected components as (color, list of (r,c) positions); essential for identifying blobs.)

```python
def get_anchor(comp):
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```
(This computes the top-left anchor for rigid shifting; helpful for placement but assumes top-aligned fitting, which may need expansion for other alignments.)

```python
def try_place(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    ar, ac = get_anchor(pos)
    min_r_b = min(r for r, c in base_pos)
    max_r_b = max(r for r, c in base_pos)
    min_c_b = min(c for r, c in base_pos)
    max_c_b = max(c for r, c in base_pos)
    for tr in range(max(0, min_r_b - 5), min(30, max_r_b + 6)):
        for tc in range(max(0, min_c_b - 5), min(30, max_c_b + 6)):
            if out[tr][tc] != 0:
                continue
            dr = tr - ar
            dc = tc - ac
            valid = True
            for r, c in pos:
                nr = r + dr
                nc = c + dc
                if not (0 <= nr < 30 and 0 <= nc < 30) or out[nr][nc] != 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                adjacent = False
                directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
                for r, c in pos:
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nnr = nr + dx
                        nnc = nc + dy
                        if 0 <= nnr < 30 and 0 <= nnc < 30 and out[nnr][nnc] > 0:
                            adjacent = True
                            break
                    if adjacent:
                        break
                if adjacent:
                    for r, c in pos:
                        out[r + dr][c + dc] = color
                    return True
    return False
```
(This attempts bounded placement near base with overlap/adjacency checks; core logic but flawed by small search window (±5/6) and base-only adjacency reference—should check against all placed pixels.)

```python
def try_place_above(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    # Similar to try_place but scans only above base (tr < min_r_b, full columns)
    # ... (code as provided)
```
(This is a variant for vertical stacking; helpful but too restrictive (full columns only, no bounded tc), and still fails if shape doesn't fit exactly above.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts all connected components using flood-fill, places the largest (base) component unchanged in its original position, and sorts smaller ones by size descending for placement order.
 * Base selection works (e.g., 8's in train1, 2's in train2), and initial out grid setup is correct.
 * Adjacency detection logic is sound (checks 4 directions from shifted positions against existing out pixels) and prevents overlaps/out-of-bounds.
 * Anchor-based shifting preserves component shapes rigidly, which matches puzzle needs (no rotation/flipping).
 * Fallback to original positions ensures no loss of components but leads to scattered outputs, which is unhelpful as expectations require connected reassembly.
 * In train1, generated output places base 8's correctly (rows 14-18 match expected 8's positions/shapes) but leaves smaller components (e.g., 6's in row9-10 cols4-8, 1's/3's/4's/2's in rows9-13) in original scattered positions instead of reassembling: expected moves 6's to row9 cols4-8 (but shifted left?), interleaves 1's/2's under 8's (rows14-15 cols5-8 for 2's), adds 3's/4's at bottom (rows19-29, connected downward); generated has no bottom attachments and upper blobs unmoved, so disconnected and incomplete stacking.
 * In train2, generated places base 2's correctly (rows8-13 full width, with some holes filled wrong) but scatters 1's/3's/4's in original top positions (rows3-7, e.g., 3's in row5-6 cols0-3); expected keeps 2's base but moves 1's to row13 col10-11 (under 2's), 3's below that (row15-17 cols9-12), 4's at bottom (row18-20); generated fails to attach downward, leaving top empty and no vertical build.
 * try_place and try_place_above are partially helpful but broken by tiny search radius (±5 around base), causing most placements to fallback to originals; adjacency only triggers if touching base_pos (not updating to all out), so later components don't attach to prior small ones.
 * Sorting by size is good but doesn't account for shape compatibility (e.g., wide blobs block narrow ones).
 * No rotation or multiple anchor tries, missing subtle fits (e.g., side-attachment in train1's 2's under 8's).
 * Overall, detects structure but fails reassembly: outputs are mostly original grid subsets, not transformed/connected as expected.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have placed the base (likely 3's, large vertical/horizontal span in cols9-15 rows7-29) in original positions but scattered others awkwardly: e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols4-7 (shifted up-left?), 6's/1's mixed in rows4-7 cols4-7, 4's/2's in rows0-3 cols16-21, with many 3's in originals and gaps filled poorly; this creates a jumbled left-side cluster but no clear stacking or full connectivity—e.g., 4's touch 3's horizontally but 8's/6's are isolated above, and bottom 3's trail off without attachments.
 * Unlike expectations (which connect everything into a single vertical/horizontal assembly, e.g., stacking small blobs atop/beside base), this is partially moved but overlaps or disconnects (e.g., row4 col8 has 1 next to 3, but shapes don't align rigidly); search window too small likely caused incomplete fits, leaving fallback positions dominant.
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too fragmented, no evident "tower" or filled structure; needs broader search and iterative adjacency to all placed (not just base) to handle test's complex shapes (long 3's column, scattered small 1/2/4/6/8).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 23:31:19] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids (though many rows are empty) where cells contain integers (0 for empty, 1-8 for colored or typed "objects" forming connected shapes or blobs), and the goal is to transform the input grid into a new output grid by identifying, extracting, and repositioning these objects according to specific rules—likely involving sorting by type/number, aligning them in a canonical order (e.g., top-to-bottom by number, left-justified), preserving shape but relocating them, and filling empty space with 0s, while possibly merging or modifying interactions between overlapping or adjacent blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects appear to be 4-connected or 8-connected groups (blobs) of the same number; e.g., in training example 1, the 4's form a cross-like shape that gets relocated intact to the bottom, the 3's form a partial square that moves down, the 6's become a horizontal bar with 1's integrated, and 8's form a large background with embedded 2's and 3's adjusted.
 * Relocation seems rule-based: blobs are extracted and placed in a sorted order (lowest to highest number?) starting from the top or bottom, but with position-specific adjustments—e.g., in training 1 expected, low numbers (1,2,6) go to rows 9-14, 8's to 14-18 with embeds, 3/4's to bottom rows 19-29; in training 2, 1's go to top, 2's stay mid with embeds, 3/4's to bottom.
 * Subtle elements: Blobs may overlap or embed during relocation (e.g., 2's inside 8's in train 1, 1's inside 2's and 3's in train 2); empty rows are preserved or collapsed minimally; shapes must retain exact connectivity and size but can rotate/flip? (no evidence yet); numbers indicate type, and 0s are background—overwriting rules prioritize higher/lower numbers? Unknown if diagonal connectivity counts.
 * Interactions: In expected outputs, some blobs are "cut" or modified (e.g., train 1 generated has intact 4's in top but expected clears them to 0s and moves elsewhere; train 2 generated keeps 1's partial but expected integrates 1's into 2's and adds 3/4 below).
 * Grid size/consistency: Always 30 rows x 30 cols; many rows all-0s, but outputs preserve structure without unnecessary padding.
 * Potential misses: Identity copy ignores all transformations; no blob detection means shapes stay in original positions; sorting order unclear (by min number? size? appearance order?); embedding rules subtle (e.g., 3's replace some 8's in train 1 row 18).
 * All considerations: Use flood-fill for blob extraction; track blob type, bounding box, and relative positions; possible canonical placement like stacking vertically by type; handle multi-blob same-type merges? (not seen); test for rotation (e.g., 4's vertical in input become horizontal? No, seem preserved).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions in this attempt—the program is a simple identity copy, which doesn't extract or manipulate anything.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (identity copy) failed both training examples completely by returning the input unchanged, missing all transformations like clearing upper shapes to 0s, relocating blobs (e.g., train 1: generated keeps 4's/3's in rows 3-6 but expected clears to all-0s and moves 6/1/2 to rows 9-14, 3/4 to 19-29; train 2: generated keeps 1's in rows 1-4 and 3's partial in 22-25 but expected integrates 1's into 2's at row 13, places 3/4 stacked at 15-20).
 * What worked: Nothing substantive—copy preserves grid structure and 0s, but that's trivial and irrelevant.
 * What didn't work: No object detection or movement, so all blobs stay in place (e.g., train 1 generated has 8's intact in rows 14-18 but expected embeds 2's and adjusts 3's; differences unknown but clearly positional); ignores sorting/relocation rules, leading to mismatches in 90%+ of non-0 cells.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this demonstrates zero understanding—no functions for blob extraction (essential for identifying connected groups like the 4-cross or 3-L shapes).
 * Function `program` (identity copy) is broken and not helpful—don't use it; replace with blob-flood-fill logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of an input grid with 3's forming a large vertical/horizontal structure across rows 0-29 (e.g., solid 3-bars in cols 9-15), 4's scattered in rows 4-7, 8's in row 3 cols 18-21 and row 5 cols 19-22, 6's building left in rows 14-17, 2's in rows 17-20 cols 21-24, 1's in row 25 cols 23, but with no transformations.
 * It does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no clearing of upper 3/4/8 to 0s and restacking by type; 6's/2's/1's not integrated or moved up; 3's not condensed to bottom). Looks incorrect because it retains original positions without relocation/embedding (e.g., 3's dominate mid-grid but should likely be sorted/aligned like train 2's 3/4 stack); unclear why 6's build incrementally leftward or 2's appear partial—probably input copy, not rule-applied.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-8 representing colors), where connected components of the same color form "objects" that must be rearranged: identify the largest object as the "base," attempt to fit smaller objects into empty spaces ("holes") within or around the base without overlapping, and stack any unfitted objects below the base in a stable, column-based manner (like Tetris stacking), ensuring no overlaps and respecting grid boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * The base is always the largest (by cell count) connected component; if ties, the code picks by index, but this may need sorting by size first.
 * "Holes" likely refer to empty (0) cells enclosed by or adjacent to the base, but the current implementation incorrectly includes all neighboring cells (even occupied ones) without verifying emptiness, leading to invalid placement targets.
 * Placement into holes requires translating the entire small object rigidly (preserving relative positions) so its anchor (top-left cell) aligns with a hole, ensuring no out-of-bounds, no overlaps with existing blocks (including base), and possibly only within the base's row/column span for "fitting."
 * If no hole fit, stack below: align under the base's column range (e.g., min to max column, or a fixed width like 6), compute a "skyline" of the highest occupied row per column below the base, drop the object to rest on the skyline without overlaps, and update the skyline.
 * Subtlety: Stacking may require sorting small objects by color or size; current code sorts below_components by color, but expected outputs suggest placement order affects stability (e.g., larger first or by anchor position).
 * Grid is 30x30, but objects are small; ensure placements don't wrap or go out of bounds.
 * Expected outputs show complete rearrangement: small objects are either embedded in base (e.g., filling gaps with matching shapes) or stacked neatly below in a compact formation, often with empty space above and around.
 * Overlaps must be strictly avoided, even with non-base objects; clearing original positions before placing is correct, but current code only clears if placed.
 * Potential miss: Base may have irregular shapes, so holes aren't simple perimeters—true holes are enclosed empties (use flood-fill from edges to find internal voids).
 * Anchors: Using top-left (min row, min col in that row) is reasonable but may fail for irregular shapes; relative deltas must preserve object connectivity and shape exactly.
 * Sorting small components: Current sort by min row then min col may not match expected order (e.g., by color, size, or left-to-right).
 * Skyline for stacking: Current implementation initializes to base_max_r but should start from base bottom +1; it scans downward for existing blocks (but in examples, below is empty), and places by max height per relative column— but arbitrary width (base_min_c to min(base_max_c, base_min_c+6)) limits stacking incorrectly.
 * In examples, stacked objects are often shifted left or centered under base, not rigidly at block_min.
 * Colors must be preserved; no recoloring.
 * If no components, return unchanged (correct edge case).

                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```

```python
def get_anchor(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Correctly finds top-left anchor (min row, then min col in that row); useful for translation reference.
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely.
 * Correctly identifies components and base (largest by size), and attempts hole-fitting and below-stacking logic, showing partial understanding of rearrangement.
 * get_holes is broken/not helpful: it collects all adjacent cells to base (including non-empty and external), without checking for actual empty holes, leading to invalid placements; do not use as-is—replace with flood-fill for internal empties or perimeter empties only.
 * Hole placement loop checks bounds and overlaps correctly (good), but since holes are wrong, no placements succeed, pushing everything to stacking.
 * Stacking sorts by color (may be wrong—expected seems by position or size), uses arbitrary width limit (6 cols, ignores full base width), and skyline init/scanning assumes blocks below base (but examples are empty), resulting in misaligned drops.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps most blocks in original positions (e.g., 8's large base intact but with intrusions like misplaced 6's and 3's), adds junk like isolated 4's/2's/1's low; expected rearranges small objects into base gaps (e.g., 1's and 2's fill top of 6's area, 3's/4's stack below in compact L-shapes) and clears originals—mismatch in all small object positions, base unchanged except minor overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated leaves 2's base mostly intact with intrusions (e.g., 1's/3's/4's embedded wrongly), empties some but doesn't stack below properly; expected drops 1's/3's/4's below base in a stacked tower (e.g., 3's on bottom, 4's/1's above, shifted left)—mismatch in embedding (overlaps base) and no below stacking, originals not cleared.
 * get_anchor and component extraction are essential and correct—keep them.
 * Overall, demonstrates core idea of base + fit/stack but misses hole detection, placement validation, stacking alignment/width, and clearing logic subtlety (only clears if placed, but fails to place).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be mostly unchanged from what seems like the input (based on patterns: large 3's vertical/horizontal spans, 1's/4's/8's/6's/2's in clusters), with no evident rearrangement—small objects like 1's, 2's, 6's are still in upper/mid positions, not fitted into the apparent base (likely the large 3's or 8's) or stacked below.
 * It does not look correct: Expected should show small components (e.g., the compact 1's, 2's, 6's groups) either embedded in gaps of the base (e.g., filling voids in 3's or 8's structures) or dropped below in a skyline-stable stack under the base's columns, with originals cleared to 0; here, everything remains in place with possible minor shifts (e.g., 2's still low-right), suggesting failed fitting/stacking like in training.
 * Missing: Cleared originals, no stacking below (bottom rows still sparse), potential overlaps if any movement occurred (hard to tell without input, but pattern unchanged); does not compact or reorganize as in expected training outputs.
 * To handle test: Ensure full base width for stacking (not arbitrary 6), proper empty hole detection (e.g., only 0-cells adjacent/internal), sort smalls by size descending for stable stacking, and verify placements update out grid fully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color) and rearrange them into a new grid by selecting the largest component as a base and attaching smaller components adjacent to it (touching via edges) or stacking them above/below to form a coherent, possibly stacked or assembled structure, while preserving the relative shapes of each component. The output must match an expected reconfiguration that connects components logically without overlaps, often repositioning them to build upward or fill spaces near the base.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (only orthogonal neighbors: up, down, left, right; no diagonals), so blobs must be extracted using flood-fill or stack-based traversal to group same-color pixels correctly.
 * The largest component (by pixel count, with color as tiebreaker) is always placed as the "base" in its original position, serving as an anchor for attaching others; smaller components must be translated (shifted rigidly, preserving shape) to touch the base or existing structure via at least one edge pixel, but cannot overlap or go out of bounds.
 * Placement prioritizes proximity to the base (searching in a bounded window around the base's bounding box, e.g., ±5 cells), requiring adjacency check after fitting; if no adjacent spot fits, try placing above the base (scanning rows from top to base's min row); fallback to original positions only if nothing works, but this often fails as the puzzle expects full reassembly.
 * Sorting smaller components by descending size (then color) ensures larger attachments go first, but this can block smaller ones if not careful; subtle issue: adjacency must be to any existing placed pixel (not just base), so update the "out" grid iteratively.
 * Anchor point for placement is the top-left (min row, then min col in that row) of each component, used for relative shifting (dr, dc); this works for top-aligned fitting but may miss rotations or flips (puzzle likely forbids them, as shapes must stay intact).
 * Grids have lots of empty space (0s), and components don't wrap around edges; expected outputs often "stack" vertically (e.g., smaller blobs on top of base like a tower) or fill gaps, but horizontal spreading is possible if adjacent.
 * Easy to miss: Overly restrictive search windows (e.g., only ±5 around base) prevent valid placements far away; adjacency check must scan all 4 directions from every pixel in the proposed position, not just the anchor.
 * Fallback to original positions pollutes the output with scattered blobs, which mismatches expectations where everything connects into one structure.
 * Colors must stay the same; no recoloring or merging different colors.
 * In expectations, disconnected original components get connected in output, suggesting the puzzle is about reassembly like a jigsaw or block-stacking game.

(This flood-fill function correctly extracts 4-connected components as (color, list of (r,c) positions); essential for identifying blobs.)

    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```
(This computes the top-left anchor for rigid shifting; helpful for placement but assumes top-aligned fitting, which may need expansion for other alignments.)

```
(This attempts bounded placement near base with overlap/adjacency checks; core logic but flawed by small search window (±5/6) and base-only adjacency reference—should check against all placed pixels.)

```python
def try_place_above(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    # Similar to try_place but scans only above base (tr < min_r_b, full columns)
    # ... (code as provided)
```
(This is a variant for vertical stacking; helpful but too restrictive (full columns only, no bounded tc), and still fails if shape doesn't fit exactly above.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts all connected components using flood-fill, places the largest (base) component unchanged in its original position, and sorts smaller ones by size descending for placement order.
 * Base selection works (e.g., 8's in train1, 2's in train2), and initial out grid setup is correct.
 * Adjacency detection logic is sound (checks 4 directions from shifted positions against existing out pixels) and prevents overlaps/out-of-bounds.
 * Anchor-based shifting preserves component shapes rigidly, which matches puzzle needs (no rotation/flipping).
 * Fallback to original positions ensures no loss of components but leads to scattered outputs, which is unhelpful as expectations require connected reassembly.
 * In train1, generated output places base 8's correctly (rows 14-18 match expected 8's positions/shapes) but leaves smaller components (e.g., 6's in row9-10 cols4-8, 1's/3's/4's/2's in rows9-13) in original scattered positions instead of reassembling: expected moves 6's to row9 cols4-8 (but shifted left?), interleaves 1's/2's under 8's (rows14-15 cols5-8 for 2's), adds 3's/4's at bottom (rows19-29, connected downward); generated has no bottom attachments and upper blobs unmoved, so disconnected and incomplete stacking.
 * In train2, generated places base 2's correctly (rows8-13 full width, with some holes filled wrong) but scatters 1's/3's/4's in original top positions (rows3-7, e.g., 3's in row5-6 cols0-3); expected keeps 2's base but moves 1's to row13 col10-11 (under 2's), 3's below that (row15-17 cols9-12), 4's at bottom (row18-20); generated fails to attach downward, leaving top empty and no vertical build.
 * try_place and try_place_above are partially helpful but broken by tiny search radius (±5 around base), causing most placements to fallback to originals; adjacency only triggers if touching base_pos (not updating to all out), so later components don't attach to prior small ones.
 * Sorting by size is good but doesn't account for shape compatibility (e.g., wide blobs block narrow ones).
 * No rotation or multiple anchor tries, missing subtle fits (e.g., side-attachment in train1's 2's under 8's).
 * Overall, detects structure but fails reassembly: outputs are mostly original grid subsets, not transformed/connected as expected.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have placed the base (likely 3's, large vertical/horizontal span in cols9-15 rows7-29) in original positions but scattered others awkwardly: e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols4-7 (shifted up-left?), 6's/1's mixed in rows4-7 cols4-7, 4's/2's in rows0-3 cols16-21, with many 3's in originals and gaps filled poorly; this creates a jumbled left-side cluster but no clear stacking or full connectivity—e.g., 4's touch 3's horizontally but 8's/6's are isolated above, and bottom 3's trail off without attachments.
 * Unlike expectations (which connect everything into a single vertical/horizontal assembly, e.g., stacking small blobs atop/beside base), this is partially moved but overlaps or disconnects (e.g., row4 col8 has 1 next to 3, but shapes don't align rigidly); search window too small likely caused incomplete fits, leaving fallback positions dominant.
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too fragmented, no evident "tower" or filled structure; needs broader search and iterative adjacency to all placed (not just base) to handle test's complex shapes (long 3's column, scattered small 1/2/4/6/8).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 23:48:52] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid where numbered cells represent colored blobs (connected components of the same number/color via 4-directional adjacency). The goal is to reassemble these disjoint blobs into a single, compact, connected structure packed toward the top-left of the grid, by translating (not rotating or deforming) each blob and placing them to maximize overall connectivity while avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-way connected groups of the same number (color); diagonals do not count as connected.
 * Identify the largest blob (by cell count) as the "base" and translate it to the top-left (starting at row 0, col 0, aligned by its own top-left anchor) to anchor the structure.
 * For smaller blobs, translate them (using their top-left anchor) to positions that maximize the number of adjacent edges (4 directions) touching already-placed cells (any color), while ensuring no overlaps with existing cells and staying within grid bounds.
 * Among positions with equal adjacency score, prefer those that result in the lowest minimum row (pack upward), then lowest minimum column (pack leftward), then smallest vertical span (more compact height).
 * Sort smaller blobs for placement by descending size (largest first to build structure), then by ascending color if sizes tie.
 * The output must form one fully connected structure (no disjoint blobs); isolated placements or failure to attach create gaps.
 * Subtlety: Original positions in input are irrelevant—everything must be relocated relative to the top-left-packed base; keeping original positions causes distant placements.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency scoring counts touching edges to any placed color (not just same color), but only after validating no overlap/out-of-bounds.
 * Subtlety: Empty input rows/columns should remain mostly empty except for the packed structure; outputs show packing starting around row 9-14 in examples, not row 0.
 * Consideration: Brute-force all possible translations (30x30 positions per blob), but optimize by checking validity early to avoid computation issues.
 * Consideration: If no valid position (e.g., due to size), the blob might not place, but examples show all blobs always placeable by attaching.
 * All blobs must preserve internal shape and relative positions—no rotation, flipping, or splitting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # This function correctly identifies 4-way connected components of the same color,
    # returning list of (color, list of (row, col) positions). Useful for extracting blobs.
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    visited = [[False] * 30 for _ in range(30)]
    components = []
    for i in range(30):
        for j in range(30):
            if g[i][j] > 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```

```python
def get_anchor(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Computes the top-left anchor (min row, then min col in that row) of a component.
    # Essential for translating blobs without distortion.
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Connected component detection worked correctly in both training examples, accurately grouping same-color adjacent cells.
 * Anchor calculation is correct and helpful for translation.
 * Base selection by max size is correct, but placement failed: base kept in original scattered positions instead of translating to top-left (row 0, col 0 aligned), causing the entire structure to start mid-grid (e.g., 8's at row 14 in train1) and small blobs to place far away.
 * Placement of small blobs prioritized top-left empty spots (score 0) over attaching to base due to flawed tie-breaking and no initial base shift, leading to disjoint groups: in train1, 6/1/4/3/2 groups placed in rows 5-12 (upper-left isolated), not touching 8's base; 3's/4's misplaced in upper area instead of attaching below 8's in rows 20-25 as expected.
 * In train1 generated vs. expected: Upper empty rows 0-4 match, but generated places 6's/1's at rows 5-7 (too high, no touch to 8's), adds erroneous 4's/3's at rows 8-12 (overlapping/misplaced, expected empty), 2's at rows 12-13 partially touch 8's but overall disjoint; expected shifts 6/1/2 group to rows 9-13 touching 8's at col 4-8, adds 4's interwoven with 3's at rows 20-25 touching 8's at col 16-20—generated has no such lower attachment and wrong shapes (e.g., 4's not below 3's).
 * In train2 generated vs. expected: Base 2's correctly identified but kept original (rows 8-13 wide), small placements isolated: 3's/1's/4's scattered in rows 13-19 with overlaps/gaps (e.g., 3's at col 10-13 row 14-17 fragmented), 4's misplaced at col 22-25 row 13-14; expected packs 1's at row 13 col 10-13 touching 2's, 3's/4's below at rows 15-19 interwoven/touching (e.g., 4's frame 3's)—generated has disjoint 4's and unknown shape mismatches in 1/3 areas.
 * Sorting small blobs by (-size, color) is reasonable but ineffective without base shift.
 * Brute-force position search is conceptually good but computationally naive (30x30=900 checks per blob, up to ~10 blobs ok), but validity check works; scoring counts adjacencies correctly but fails to prefer base proximity without shift.
 * No rotation/deformation attempted, which is correct (preserves shapes).
 * Overall, attempts show partial understanding (blob extraction solid), but core failure in relocating base to top-left causes all placements to cascade wrong, resulting in 0/2 training passes; no unhelpful functions, but original-position base placement is broken for this puzzle.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places a mixed 2/4/8/3 group in upper rows 0-4 (left cols 0-16), then 1's/6's in rows 14-20 (partially touching 3's but disjoint from upper), followed by long vertical 3's stacks in rows 6-29 (cols 9-15, separate from main group). This creates multiple disjoint structures (upper mixed, mid 1/6, lower 3's), not one connected whole packed top-left. Expected likely packs all (2/3/4/6/8/1) into a single interwoven blob starting ~row 0-5 left-aligned, with 3's integrated (not isolated verticals), 6's/1's attached to 8's/4's, and no gaps—generated has overlaps (e.g., 3's intrude on 8's at row 3 col 9-16?) and unknown shape distortions (e.g., 3's too fragmented vertically). Fails attachment rule, as lower 3's don't touch upper meaningfully.

[2025-10-01 23:48:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids (though many rows are empty) where cells contain integers (0 for empty, 1-8 for colored or typed "objects" forming connected shapes or blobs), and the goal is to transform the input grid into a new output grid by identifying, extracting, and repositioning these objects according to specific rules—likely involving sorting by type/number, aligning them in a canonical order (e.g., top-to-bottom by number, left-justified), preserving shape but relocating them, and filling empty space with 0s, while possibly merging or modifying interactions between overlapping or adjacent blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects appear to be 4-connected or 8-connected groups (blobs) of the same number; e.g., in training example 1, the 4's form a cross-like shape that gets relocated intact to the bottom, the 3's form a partial square that moves down, the 6's become a horizontal bar with 1's integrated, and 8's form a large background with embedded 2's and 3's adjusted.
 * Relocation seems rule-based: blobs are extracted and placed in a sorted order (lowest to highest number?) starting from the top or bottom, but with position-specific adjustments—e.g., in training 1 expected, low numbers (1,2,6) go to rows 9-14, 8's to 14-18 with embeds, 3/4's to bottom rows 19-29; in training 2, 1's go to top, 2's stay mid with embeds, 3/4's to bottom.
 * Subtle elements: Blobs may overlap or embed during relocation (e.g., 2's inside 8's in train 1, 1's inside 2's and 3's in train 2); empty rows are preserved or collapsed minimally; shapes must retain exact connectivity and size but can rotate/flip? (no evidence yet); numbers indicate type, and 0s are background—overwriting rules prioritize higher/lower numbers? Unknown if diagonal connectivity counts.
 * Interactions: In expected outputs, some blobs are "cut" or modified (e.g., train 1 generated has intact 4's in top but expected clears them to 0s and moves elsewhere; train 2 generated keeps 1's partial but expected integrates 1's into 2's and adds 3/4 below).
 * Grid size/consistency: Always 30 rows x 30 cols; many rows all-0s, but outputs preserve structure without unnecessary padding.
 * Potential misses: Identity copy ignores all transformations; no blob detection means shapes stay in original positions; sorting order unclear (by min number? size? appearance order?); embedding rules subtle (e.g., 3's replace some 8's in train 1 row 18).
 * All considerations: Use flood-fill for blob extraction; track blob type, bounding box, and relative positions; possible canonical placement like stacking vertically by type; handle multi-blob same-type merges? (not seen); test for rotation (e.g., 4's vertical in input become horizontal? No, seem preserved).

No helpful functions in this attempt—the program is a simple identity copy, which doesn't extract or manipulate anything.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (identity copy) failed both training examples completely by returning the input unchanged, missing all transformations like clearing upper shapes to 0s, relocating blobs (e.g., train 1: generated keeps 4's/3's in rows 3-6 but expected clears to all-0s and moves 6/1/2 to rows 9-14, 3/4 to 19-29; train 2: generated keeps 1's in rows 1-4 and 3's partial in 22-25 but expected integrates 1's into 2's at row 13, places 3/4 stacked at 15-20).
 * What worked: Nothing substantive—copy preserves grid structure and 0s, but that's trivial and irrelevant.
 * What didn't work: No object detection or movement, so all blobs stay in place (e.g., train 1 generated has 8's intact in rows 14-18 but expected embeds 2's and adjusts 3's; differences unknown but clearly positional); ignores sorting/relocation rules, leading to mismatches in 90%+ of non-0 cells.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this demonstrates zero understanding—no functions for blob extraction (essential for identifying connected groups like the 4-cross or 3-L shapes).
 * Function `program` (identity copy) is broken and not helpful—don't use it; replace with blob-flood-fill logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of an input grid with 3's forming a large vertical/horizontal structure across rows 0-29 (e.g., solid 3-bars in cols 9-15), 4's scattered in rows 4-7, 8's in row 3 cols 18-21 and row 5 cols 19-22, 6's building left in rows 14-17, 2's in rows 17-20 cols 21-24, 1's in row 25 cols 23, but with no transformations.
 * It does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no clearing of upper 3/4/8 to 0s and restacking by type; 6's/2's/1's not integrated or moved up; 3's not condensed to bottom). Looks incorrect because it retains original positions without relocation/embedding (e.g., 3's dominate mid-grid but should likely be sorted/aligned like train 2's 3/4 stack); unclear why 6's build incrementally leftward or 2's appear partial—probably input copy, not rule-applied.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-8 representing colors), where connected components of the same color form "objects" that must be rearranged: identify the largest object as the "base," attempt to fit smaller objects into empty spaces ("holes") within or around the base without overlapping, and stack any unfitted objects below the base in a stable, column-based manner (like Tetris stacking), ensuring no overlaps and respecting grid boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * The base is always the largest (by cell count) connected component; if ties, the code picks by index, but this may need sorting by size first.
 * "Holes" likely refer to empty (0) cells enclosed by or adjacent to the base, but the current implementation incorrectly includes all neighboring cells (even occupied ones) without verifying emptiness, leading to invalid placement targets.
 * Placement into holes requires translating the entire small object rigidly (preserving relative positions) so its anchor (top-left cell) aligns with a hole, ensuring no out-of-bounds, no overlaps with existing blocks (including base), and possibly only within the base's row/column span for "fitting."
 * If no hole fit, stack below: align under the base's column range (e.g., min to max column, or a fixed width like 6), compute a "skyline" of the highest occupied row per column below the base, drop the object to rest on the skyline without overlaps, and update the skyline.
 * Subtlety: Stacking may require sorting small objects by color or size; current code sorts below_components by color, but expected outputs suggest placement order affects stability (e.g., larger first or by anchor position).
 * Grid is 30x30, but objects are small; ensure placements don't wrap or go out of bounds.
 * Expected outputs show complete rearrangement: small objects are either embedded in base (e.g., filling gaps with matching shapes) or stacked neatly below in a compact formation, often with empty space above and around.
 * Overlaps must be strictly avoided, even with non-base objects; clearing original positions before placing is correct, but current code only clears if placed.
 * Potential miss: Base may have irregular shapes, so holes aren't simple perimeters—true holes are enclosed empties (use flood-fill from edges to find internal voids).
 * Anchors: Using top-left (min row, min col in that row) is reasonable but may fail for irregular shapes; relative deltas must preserve object connectivity and shape exactly.
 * Sorting small components: Current sort by min row then min col may not match expected order (e.g., by color, size, or left-to-right).
 * Skyline for stacking: Current implementation initializes to base_max_r but should start from base bottom +1; it scans downward for existing blocks (but in examples, below is empty), and places by max height per relative column— but arbitrary width (base_min_c to min(base_max_c, base_min_c+6)) limits stacking incorrectly.
 * In examples, stacked objects are often shifted left or centered under base, not rigidly at block_min.
 * Colors must be preserved; no recoloring.
 * If no components, return unchanged (correct edge case).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely.
 * Correctly identifies components and base (largest by size), and attempts hole-fitting and below-stacking logic, showing partial understanding of rearrangement.
 * get_holes is broken/not helpful: it collects all adjacent cells to base (including non-empty and external), without checking for actual empty holes, leading to invalid placements; do not use as-is—replace with flood-fill for internal empties or perimeter empties only.
 * Hole placement loop checks bounds and overlaps correctly (good), but since holes are wrong, no placements succeed, pushing everything to stacking.
 * Stacking sorts by color (may be wrong—expected seems by position or size), uses arbitrary width limit (6 cols, ignores full base width), and skyline init/scanning assumes blocks below base (but examples are empty), resulting in misaligned drops.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps most blocks in original positions (e.g., 8's large base intact but with intrusions like misplaced 6's and 3's), adds junk like isolated 4's/2's/1's low; expected rearranges small objects into base gaps (e.g., 1's and 2's fill top of 6's area, 3's/4's stack below in compact L-shapes) and clears originals—mismatch in all small object positions, base unchanged except minor overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated leaves 2's base mostly intact with intrusions (e.g., 1's/3's/4's embedded wrongly), empties some but doesn't stack below properly; expected drops 1's/3's/4's below base in a stacked tower (e.g., 3's on bottom, 4's/1's above, shifted left)—mismatch in embedding (overlaps base) and no below stacking, originals not cleared.
 * get_anchor and component extraction are essential and correct—keep them.
 * Overall, demonstrates core idea of base + fit/stack but misses hole detection, placement validation, stacking alignment/width, and clearing logic subtlety (only clears if placed, but fails to place).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be mostly unchanged from what seems like the input (based on patterns: large 3's vertical/horizontal spans, 1's/4's/8's/6's/2's in clusters), with no evident rearrangement—small objects like 1's, 2's, 6's are still in upper/mid positions, not fitted into the apparent base (likely the large 3's or 8's) or stacked below.
 * It does not look correct: Expected should show small components (e.g., the compact 1's, 2's, 6's groups) either embedded in gaps of the base (e.g., filling voids in 3's or 8's structures) or dropped below in a skyline-stable stack under the base's columns, with originals cleared to 0; here, everything remains in place with possible minor shifts (e.g., 2's still low-right), suggesting failed fitting/stacking like in training.
 * Missing: Cleared originals, no stacking below (bottom rows still sparse), potential overlaps if any movement occurred (hard to tell without input, but pattern unchanged); does not compact or reorganize as in expected training outputs.
 * To handle test: Ensure full base width for stacking (not arbitrary 6), proper empty hole detection (e.g., only 0-cells adjacent/internal), sort smalls by size descending for stable stacking, and verify placements update out grid fully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color) and rearrange them into a new grid by selecting the largest component as a base and attaching smaller components adjacent to it (touching via edges) or stacking them above/below to form a coherent, possibly stacked or assembled structure, while preserving the relative shapes of each component. The output must match an expected reconfiguration that connects components logically without overlaps, often repositioning them to build upward or fill spaces near the base.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (only orthogonal neighbors: up, down, left, right; no diagonals), so blobs must be extracted using flood-fill or stack-based traversal to group same-color pixels correctly.
 * The largest component (by pixel count, with color as tiebreaker) is always placed as the "base" in its original position, serving as an anchor for attaching others; smaller components must be translated (shifted rigidly, preserving shape) to touch the base or existing structure via at least one edge pixel, but cannot overlap or go out of bounds.
 * Placement prioritizes proximity to the base (searching in a bounded window around the base's bounding box, e.g., ±5 cells), requiring adjacency check after fitting; if no adjacent spot fits, try placing above the base (scanning rows from top to base's min row); fallback to original positions only if nothing works, but this often fails as the puzzle expects full reassembly.
 * Sorting smaller components by descending size (then color) ensures larger attachments go first, but this can block smaller ones if not careful; subtle issue: adjacency must be to any existing placed pixel (not just base), so update the "out" grid iteratively.
 * Anchor point for placement is the top-left (min row, then min col in that row) of each component, used for relative shifting (dr, dc); this works for top-aligned fitting but may miss rotations or flips (puzzle likely forbids them, as shapes must stay intact).
 * Grids have lots of empty space (0s), and components don't wrap around edges; expected outputs often "stack" vertically (e.g., smaller blobs on top of base like a tower) or fill gaps, but horizontal spreading is possible if adjacent.
 * Easy to miss: Overly restrictive search windows (e.g., only ±5 around base) prevent valid placements far away; adjacency check must scan all 4 directions from every pixel in the proposed position, not just the anchor.
 * Fallback to original positions pollutes the output with scattered blobs, which mismatches expectations where everything connects into one structure.
 * Colors must stay the same; no recoloring or merging different colors.
 * In expectations, disconnected original components get connected in output, suggesting the puzzle is about reassembly like a jigsaw or block-stacking game.

(This flood-fill function correctly extracts 4-connected components as (color, list of (r,c) positions); essential for identifying blobs.)

    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```
(This computes the top-left anchor for rigid shifting; helpful for placement but assumes top-aligned fitting, which may need expansion for other alignments.)

```python
def try_place(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    ar, ac = get_anchor(pos)
    min_r_b = min(r for r, c in base_pos)
    max_r_b = max(r for r, c in base_pos)

            for r, c in pos:
                nr = r + dr
                nc = c + dc
                if not (0 <= nr < 30 and 0 <= nc < 30) or out[nr][nc] != 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:

                for r, c in pos:
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nnr = nr + dx

                        if 0 <= nnr < 30 and 0 <= nnc < 30 and out[nnr][nnc] > 0:
                            adjacent = True
                            break
                    if adjacent:
                        break
                if adjacent:
                    for r, c in pos:
                        out[r + dr][c + dc] = color
                    return True
    return False
```
(This attempts bounded placement near base with overlap/adjacency checks; core logic but flawed by small search window (±5/6) and base-only adjacency reference—should check against all placed pixels.)

```python
def try_place_above(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    # Similar to try_place but scans only above base (tr < min_r_b, full columns)
    # ... (code as provided)
```
(This is a variant for vertical stacking; helpful but too restrictive (full columns only, no bounded tc), and still fails if shape doesn't fit exactly above.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts all connected components using flood-fill, places the largest (base) component unchanged in its original position, and sorts smaller ones by size descending for placement order.
 * Base selection works (e.g., 8's in train1, 2's in train2), and initial out grid setup is correct.
 * Adjacency detection logic is sound (checks 4 directions from shifted positions against existing out pixels) and prevents overlaps/out-of-bounds.
 * Anchor-based shifting preserves component shapes rigidly, which matches puzzle needs (no rotation/flipping).
 * Fallback to original positions ensures no loss of components but leads to scattered outputs, which is unhelpful as expectations require connected reassembly.
 * In train1, generated output places base 8's correctly (rows 14-18 match expected 8's positions/shapes) but leaves smaller components (e.g., 6's in row9-10 cols4-8, 1's/3's/4's/2's in rows9-13) in original scattered positions instead of reassembling: expected moves 6's to row9 cols4-8 (but shifted left?), interleaves 1's/2's under 8's (rows14-15 cols5-8 for 2's), adds 3's/4's at bottom (rows19-29, connected downward); generated has no bottom attachments and upper blobs unmoved, so disconnected and incomplete stacking.
 * In train2, generated places base 2's correctly (rows8-13 full width, with some holes filled wrong) but scatters 1's/3's/4's in original top positions (rows3-7, e.g., 3's in row5-6 cols0-3); expected keeps 2's base but moves 1's to row13 col10-11 (under 2's), 3's below that (row15-17 cols9-12), 4's at bottom (row18-20); generated fails to attach downward, leaving top empty and no vertical build.
 * try_place and try_place_above are partially helpful but broken by tiny search radius (±5 around base), causing most placements to fallback to originals; adjacency only triggers if touching base_pos (not updating to all out), so later components don't attach to prior small ones.
 * Sorting by size is good but doesn't account for shape compatibility (e.g., wide blobs block narrow ones).
 * No rotation or multiple anchor tries, missing subtle fits (e.g., side-attachment in train1's 2's under 8's).
 * Overall, detects structure but fails reassembly: outputs are mostly original grid subsets, not transformed/connected as expected.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have placed the base (likely 3's, large vertical/horizontal span in cols9-15 rows7-29) in original positions but scattered others awkwardly: e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols4-7 (shifted up-left?), 6's/1's mixed in rows4-7 cols4-7, 4's/2's in rows0-3 cols16-21, with many 3's in originals and gaps filled poorly; this creates a jumbled left-side cluster but no clear stacking or full connectivity—e.g., 4's touch 3's horizontally but 8's/6's are isolated above, and bottom 3's trail off without attachments.
 * Unlike expectations (which connect everything into a single vertical/horizontal assembly, e.g., stacking small blobs atop/beside base), this is partially moved but overlaps or disconnects (e.g., row4 col8 has 1 next to 3, but shapes don't align rigidly); search window too small likely caused incomplete fits, leaving fallback positions dominant.
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too fragmented, no evident "tower" or filled structure; needs broader search and iterative adjacency to all placed (not just base) to handle test's complex shapes (long 3's column, scattered small 1/2/4/6/8).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid where numbered cells represent colored blobs (connected components of the same number/color via 4-directional adjacency). The goal is to reassemble these disjoint blobs into a single, compact, connected structure packed toward the top-left of the grid, by translating (not rotating or deforming) each blob and placing them to maximize overall connectivity while avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-way connected groups of the same number (color); diagonals do not count as connected.
 * Identify the largest blob (by cell count) as the "base" and translate it to the top-left (starting at row 0, col 0, aligned by its own top-left anchor) to anchor the structure.
 * For smaller blobs, translate them (using their top-left anchor) to positions that maximize the number of adjacent edges (4 directions) touching already-placed cells (any color), while ensuring no overlaps with existing cells and staying within grid bounds.
 * Among positions with equal adjacency score, prefer those that result in the lowest minimum row (pack upward), then lowest minimum column (pack leftward), then smallest vertical span (more compact height).
 * Sort smaller blobs for placement by descending size (largest first to build structure), then by ascending color if sizes tie.
 * The output must form one fully connected structure (no disjoint blobs); isolated placements or failure to attach create gaps.
 * Subtlety: Original positions in input are irrelevant—everything must be relocated relative to the top-left-packed base; keeping original positions causes distant placements.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency scoring counts touching edges to any placed color (not just same color), but only after validating no overlap/out-of-bounds.
 * Subtlety: Empty input rows/columns should remain mostly empty except for the packed structure; outputs show packing starting around row 9-14 in examples, not row 0.
 * Consideration: Brute-force all possible translations (30x30 positions per blob), but optimize by checking validity early to avoid computation issues.
 * Consideration: If no valid position (e.g., due to size), the blob might not place, but examples show all blobs always placeable by attaching.
 * All blobs must preserve internal shape and relative positions—no rotation, flipping, or splitting.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Connected component detection worked correctly in both training examples, accurately grouping same-color adjacent cells.
 * Anchor calculation is correct and helpful for translation.
 * Base selection by max size is correct, but placement failed: base kept in original scattered positions instead of translating to top-left (row 0, col 0 aligned), causing the entire structure to start mid-grid (e.g., 8's at row 14 in train1) and small blobs to place far away.
 * Placement of small blobs prioritized top-left empty spots (score 0) over attaching to base due to flawed tie-breaking and no initial base shift, leading to disjoint groups: in train1, 6/1/4/3/2 groups placed in rows 5-12 (upper-left isolated), not touching 8's base; 3's/4's misplaced in upper area instead of attaching below 8's in rows 20-25 as expected.
 * In train1 generated vs. expected: Upper empty rows 0-4 match, but generated places 6's/1's at rows 5-7 (too high, no touch to 8's), adds erroneous 4's/3's at rows 8-12 (overlapping/misplaced, expected empty), 2's at rows 12-13 partially touch 8's but overall disjoint; expected shifts 6/1/2 group to rows 9-13 touching 8's at col 4-8, adds 4's interwoven with 3's at rows 20-25 touching 8's at col 16-20—generated has no such lower attachment and wrong shapes (e.g., 4's not below 3's).
 * In train2 generated vs. expected: Base 2's correctly identified but kept original (rows 8-13 wide), small placements isolated: 3's/1's/4's scattered in rows 13-19 with overlaps/gaps (e.g., 3's at col 10-13 row 14-17 fragmented), 4's misplaced at col 22-25 row 13-14; expected packs 1's at row 13 col 10-13 touching 2's, 3's/4's below at rows 15-19 interwoven/touching (e.g., 4's frame 3's)—generated has disjoint 4's and unknown shape mismatches in 1/3 areas.
 * Sorting small blobs by (-size, color) is reasonable but ineffective without base shift.
 * Brute-force position search is conceptually good but computationally naive (30x30=900 checks per blob, up to ~10 blobs ok), but validity check works; scoring counts adjacencies correctly but fails to prefer base proximity without shift.
 * No rotation/deformation attempted, which is correct (preserves shapes).
 * Overall, attempts show partial understanding (blob extraction solid), but core failure in relocating base to top-left causes all placements to cascade wrong, resulting in 0/2 training passes; no unhelpful functions, but original-position base placement is broken for this puzzle.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places a mixed 2/4/8/3 group in upper rows 0-4 (left cols 0-16), then 1's/6's in rows 14-20 (partially touching 3's but disjoint from upper), followed by long vertical 3's stacks in rows 6-29 (cols 9-15, separate from main group). This creates multiple disjoint structures (upper mixed, mid 1/6, lower 3's), not one connected whole packed top-left. Expected likely packs all (2/3/4/6/8/1) into a single interwoven blob starting ~row 0-5 left-aligned, with 3's integrated (not isolated verticals), 6's/1's attached to 8's/4's, and no gaps—generated has overlaps (e.g., 3's intrude on 8's at row 3 col 9-16?) and unknown shape distortions (e.g., 3's too fragmented vertically). Fails attachment rule, as lower 3's don't touch upper meaningfully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 00:01:16] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual reassembly puzzle where the input grid contains disconnected colored regions (connected components of the same number/color), and the goal is to identify the largest component as a fixed "base" image, then translate (shift by dr/dc) the smaller components to adjacent or filling positions relative to the base to reconstruct a coherent overall picture without overlaps, ensuring connectivity and proper alignment. The output should match an expected reconstructed grid, likely forming a specific shape or scene from the pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the exact same color value (number >0); diagonals do not count as connected.
 * The largest component (by cell count) is treated as the immovable base; if multiple largest, select the one with the smallest color value as base.
 * Smaller components must be rigidly translated (no rotation, scaling, or deformation) to new positions that do not overlap existing placed cells (out[r][c] must be 0) and stay within 30x30 bounds.
 * Placement must ensure adjacency: at least one cell of the small component must touch (4-way) an already placed cell (from base or prior smalls), or the placement is invalid.
 * Optimization for placement: Prefer positions that "fill" the base's bounding box (cells inside base_min_r to base_max_r and base_min_c to base_max_c score higher), maximize adjacent touches (adj_count), and tie-break by minimizing row/col positions (top-left preference via -min_nr, -min_nc).
 * If no valid placement found for a small component, it is omitted (left as 0s).
 * Subtlety: The base's bounding box is used for "filling" scoring, but placements can extend outside it; however, the score heavily favors internal filling to reconstruct dense shapes.
 * All-zero input or no components yields all-zero output.
 * Components must preserve their exact shape and color during translation.
 * Potential for multiple smalls of same color, but they are treated separately if disconnected.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of smalls by (-min_r, min_c) of their original positions may influence placement order, potentially affecting overlaps; exhaustive search over dr/dc (-29 to 29) is computationally heavy but necessary for exact fit.
 * No rotation or mirroring allowed; only pure translation.
 * The reconstructed image likely forms a specific puzzle picture (e.g., a character or object), so placements should visually cohere beyond just scoring.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import sys

def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    """

    """

                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```

The `program` function structure is partially helpful (component extraction and base selection), but the placement loop is flawed (see below); the scoring tuple (fill_count, adj_count, -min_nr, -min_nc) is a good idea but needs refinement for better fits.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly extracts connected components using 4-way adjacency and identifies the base as the largest (with min color tie-break), which works for placing the immovable parts in both training examples (e.g., 8's in train1 and 2's in train2 are positioned correctly relative to their original spots).
 * Base bounding box calculation is accurate and used for fill scoring, which is a key insight for reconstruction.
 * Sorting smalls by (-min_r, min_c) attempts to process "top-left first," which may help order but doesn't guarantee correct assembly order.
 * Placement validation correctly checks bounds and no-overlap (out[nr][nc] == 0), and requires at least one adjacency (has_adj), preventing isolated placements.
 * However, the exhaustive dr/dc search (-29 to 29) is too broad and inefficient, leading to suboptimal or wrong placements; it often finds local maxima that don't reconstruct the expected image (e.g., smalls placed far away or inside base without proper shape matching).
 * In train1, generated output places 1's and 2's on the left of base 8's (rows 10-13), 4's partially overlapping/near base, 3's and 6's below (rows 19-21), but expected has 6's above 1's/2's on top of base (rows 9-13 for top pieces), and 3's/4's in a stacked formation below (rows 19-26 with specific 4-3 interleaving); difference: wrong vertical/horizontal shifts, no filling of base extensions upward, and 6's omitted entirely (likely no valid adj placement found under current scoring).
 * In train1, top 10 rows are all 0s in generated (vs. expected with 6's/1's starting row9), showing failure to extend base upward.
 * In train2, generated places 1's/3's/4's scattered near base 2's (e.g., 1's in row12 col18-20, 3's in row15-17 col9-12, 4's in row18 col9-12), but expected has 1's higher in row12 col10-13, 3's in row16-18 col9-12 shifted down/right, and 4's in row18-20 col9-12; difference: smalls not shifted to fill gaps properly (e.g., 1's not aligned left, 3's/4's vertically stacked wrong), and some 0s where expected has pieces (e.g., row14 col23-24).
 * Both trains fail to achieve exact match, with generated having misplaced smalls (wrong dr/dc chosen) and occasional omissions (e.g., train1 6's missing, possibly due to no adj position scoring high enough).
 * Scoring prioritizes fill_count too heavily, but in expects, some placements extend outside base bbox (e.g., train1 4's/3's below base); adj_count is underweighted, leading to loose connections.
 * No rotation or advanced fitting (e.g., shape matching beyond translation) attempted, which is correct but insufficient for puzzle coherence.
 * The all-zero fallback for empty input is correct but unused here.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to treat a large 3-component as base (flooding much of the grid with 3's in rows 4-29, cols 9-15+), then scatter smaller pieces like 6's (rows 0-3 col7-8), 4's (rows 0-3 col16-19), 2's (rows 11-14 col16-17), 1's (rows 17-19 col16-18), and 8's (rows 17-20 col5-8), creating a messy, non-coherent spread rather than a unified picture.
 * Issues: Over-reliance on 3's as base leads to overwriting potential spaces; smalls are placed with minimal connection (e.g., 2's touch 3's edge but don't fill gaps), and no upward/downward extensions like in train expects; many 0s remain where pieces should connect (e.g., rows 4-10 have isolated 3's without adjacent smalls integrating); visually, it looks like fragmented blobs rather than reassembled (e.g., 8's and 1's near bottom don't align with top 6's/4's).
 * Likely wrong because test input (inferred from placements) has multiple large 3-regions that get merged incorrectly; expects probably require precise shifts to form vertical/horizontal stacks similar to trains (e.g., smalls filling "arms" or "legs" of a figure), but scoring picks suboptimal top-left-ish positions without true image reconstruction.
 * To handle test: Need better scoring (e.g., penalize extensions outside bbox less, reward multi-adjacency or shape complementarity); possibly process smalls in color order or size-descending for better layering.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties across **both** train examples. These are limited to patterns that hold in *every* provided train case, without forcing explanations or assuming puzzle semantics (e.g., no high-level "rules" or solutions). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific colors, exact stacking orders, or non-recurring position mappings) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., how exact x-positions or y-offsets within stacks are determined) are noted as such rather than speculated.

- **Bounding box width → Stacking group**: 
  - Shapes are grouped exclusively by their input bounding box width (x-max - x-min).
  - All shapes with the *exact same* input width form a single vertical stack in the output.
  - This grouping is consistent: Train 1 has one group of width-4 shapes (Pink, Blue, Red) and one group of width-3 shapes (Yellow, first Green, second Green); Train 2 has one group of width-3 shapes (Blue, Green, Yellow). No cross-width mixing occurs in either case.
  - Single-shape groups (if width is unique) would stack as a trivial single-item column, though not observed in trains.

- **Stacking group → Vertical positioning (y-direction)**:
  - Shapes within a stacking group are translated to share the *same* output x-start position (forming a narrow column), but their individual y-start positions are adjusted to place them adjacent or minimally overlapping in the y-direction (preserving relative vertical order potential, though exact order is unknown).
  - Output y-positions for all stacks are consistently set to align with or slightly overlap the top edge of the base shape (e.g., Train 1 stacks start/end near y=14-18 base top; Train 2 stack starts near y=12-13 base top). Exact y-offsets or intra-group ordering (top-to-bottom) are unknown.

- **Input bounding box width/height → Output bounding box dimensions**:
  - Every shape preserves its exact input bounding box width and height in the output (no scaling or rotation in dimensions; only translation).
  - This holds for all shapes, including those in stacks and the base (e.g., Train 1 width-4 shapes remain width-4; Train 2 width-3 shapes remain width-3).

- **Pixel count → Shape preservation**:
  - Every shape's pixel count is unchanged from input to output, ensuring area preservation (consistent across all instances, even for duplicate colors like Green).
  - This interacts with bbox dimensions: Preserved pixels + preserved width/height imply no internal pixel additions/removals or shape deformations beyond positioning.

- **Pixel count → Base shape identification and stability**:
  - The shape with the maximum pixel count (the "base": Maroon p=138 in Train 1; Red p=151 in Train 2) remains completely unchanged—bbox position, width, height, and pixels all identical in input and output.
  - All other (non-max pixel) shapes interact with the base by having their stacks positioned relative to it (as noted in vertical positioning above). No other shapes remain fixed.

- **Holes → No interaction**:
  - All shapes have holes=0 in both inputs and outputs, with no variation or effect on other properties (consistent but non-interactive/irrelevant).

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- No consistent color-based interactions (e.g., no color → position, color → grouping, or color → transformation; colors like Green repeat without pattern, and base color varies: Maroon/Red).
- No consistent position-based interactions beyond width grouping and base-relative y-placement (e.g., input x/y does not reliably map to output x/y or order; input positions may influence stack x-start, but this is unknown and inconsistent, e.g., Train 1 width-4 stack x=4 vs. input x=3/16/23; Train 2 x=9 vs. input x=3/13/15).
- No shape-specific (e.g., L-shape, bar, heart) or semantic interactions identifiable from data alone (descriptions suggest possible shape transformations like "stacked" or "triangular," but no consistent pixel/bbox evidence across trains; do not force).
- Test input not used for pattern identification (per instructions), but noted for context: It has varied widths (w=2 Blue, w=3 Pink/Red, w=4 Yellow, w=5 Maroon, w=6 Green base), which would imply multiple groups if patterns hold.
- No other properties (e.g., bbox area, color pairs, holes) show interactions consistent in *every* train example.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 00:02:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties across **both** train examples. These are limited to patterns that hold in *every* provided train case, without forcing explanations or assuming puzzle semantics (e.g., no high-level "rules" or solutions). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific colors, exact stacking orders, or non-recurring position mappings) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., how exact x-positions or y-offsets within stacks are determined) are noted as such rather than speculated.

- **Bounding box width → Stacking group**: 
  - Shapes are grouped exclusively by their input bounding box width (x-max - x-min).
  - All shapes with the *exact same* input width form a single vertical stack in the output.
  - This grouping is consistent: Train 1 has one group of width-4 shapes (Pink, Blue, Red) and one group of width-3 shapes (Yellow, first Green, second Green); Train 2 has one group of width-3 shapes (Blue, Green, Yellow). No cross-width mixing occurs in either case.
  - Single-shape groups (if width is unique) would stack as a trivial single-item column, though not observed in trains.

- **Stacking group → Vertical positioning (y-direction)**:
  - Shapes within a stacking group are translated to share the *same* output x-start position (forming a narrow column), but their individual y-start positions are adjusted to place them adjacent or minimally overlapping in the y-direction (preserving relative vertical order potential, though exact order is unknown).
  - Output y-positions for all stacks are consistently set to align with or slightly overlap the top edge of the base shape (e.g., Train 1 stacks start/end near y=14-18 base top; Train 2 stack starts near y=12-13 base top). Exact y-offsets or intra-group ordering (top-to-bottom) are unknown.

- **Input bounding box width/height → Output bounding box dimensions**:
  - Every shape preserves its exact input bounding box width and height in the output (no scaling or rotation in dimensions; only translation).
  - This holds for all shapes, including those in stacks and the base (e.g., Train 1 width-4 shapes remain width-4; Train 2 width-3 shapes remain width-3).

- **Pixel count → Shape preservation**:
  - Every shape's pixel count is unchanged from input to output, ensuring area preservation (consistent across all instances, even for duplicate colors like Green).
  - This interacts with bbox dimensions: Preserved pixels + preserved width/height imply no internal pixel additions/removals or shape deformations beyond positioning.

- **Pixel count → Base shape identification and stability**:
  - The shape with the maximum pixel count (the "base": Maroon p=138 in Train 1; Red p=151 in Train 2) remains completely unchanged—bbox position, width, height, and pixels all identical in input and output.
  - All other (non-max pixel) shapes interact with the base by having their stacks positioned relative to it (as noted in vertical positioning above). No other shapes remain fixed.

- **Holes → No interaction**:
  - All shapes have holes=0 in both inputs and outputs, with no variation or effect on other properties (consistent but non-interactive/irrelevant).

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- No consistent color-based interactions (e.g., no color → position, color → grouping, or color → transformation; colors like Green repeat without pattern, and base color varies: Maroon/Red).
- No consistent position-based interactions beyond width grouping and base-relative y-placement (e.g., input x/y does not reliably map to output x/y or order; input positions may influence stack x-start, but this is unknown and inconsistent, e.g., Train 1 width-4 stack x=4 vs. input x=3/16/23; Train 2 x=9 vs. input x=3/13/15).
- No shape-specific (e.g., L-shape, bar, heart) or semantic interactions identifiable from data alone (descriptions suggest possible shape transformations like "stacked" or "triangular," but no consistent pixel/bbox evidence across trains; do not force).
- Test input not used for pattern identification (per instructions), but noted for context: It has varied widths (w=2 Blue, w=3 Pink/Red, w=4 Yellow, w=5 Maroon, w=6 Green base), which would imply multiple groups if patterns hold.
- No other properties (e.g., bbox area, color pairs, holes) show interactions consistent in *every* train example.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 00:18:24] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors), where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color, 4-connected) and rearrange them into a new grid. The largest blob (by pixel count) serves as a "base" structure, and smaller blobs are attached or packed around it in a way that forms a cohesive or interlocking assembly, often integrating them into or adjacent to the base without overlaps, following rules based on blob dimensions, original positions, or size ordering to match expected layouts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and same-color pixels only; disconnected same-color pixels form separate components.
 * The base is always the largest blob by pixel count; if ties, the code picks one, but expected outputs suggest it might need to be the one with the most central or specific positional traits.
 * Placement is conditional on base orientation: if taller than wide (vertical), attach stacks to the left, starting from the top; if wider than tall (horizontal), attach below, starting from the left. However, this leads to separate stacking without integration, while expecteds show interlocking (e.g., small blobs nested within or protruding from base gaps).
 * Grouping small blobs by bounding box width (max_c - min_c + 1) is used, then sorting within groups by min_r ascending and min_c descending (to preserve some original vertical-then-right-to-left order), and processing widths descending (largest first). This works for ordering but fails in placement, as expecteds integrate blobs rather than stacking rigidly.
 * Avoid overlaps: Code checks if output[gr][gc] == 0 before placing, which is good, but expecteds have no overlaps and precise fitting (e.g., blobs fill gaps in base or align to form larger shapes).
 * Handle empty grids: Returns all-zero grid if no components, which matches expecteds' top rows of zeros.
 * Subtle: Original positions influence sorting/placement order (e.g., higher min_r first), suggesting preservation of "reading order" (top-to-bottom, right-to-left within rows?). Blobs may need rotation or flipping? No evidence, but rigid translation fails.
 * Bounds checking: Ensure placements stay within 0-29; code does this, but in vertical mode, stacking from b_min_r can overflow if base is low; in horizontal, from b_max_r +1 can push beyond.
 * Integration vs. separation: Generated outputs keep blobs separate (no merging), but expecteds merge them into a single connected structure (e.g., small blobs fill base voids or extend it). Pixel count preservation: All pixels from input must appear in output, unchanged colors.
 * Edge cases: Blobs with holes or irregular shapes (e.g., L/T/etc.) need relative positioning preserved during translation. Small blobs (1-5 pixels) attach differently than large ones. All-zero areas in input are ignored.
 * Potential missed rule: Placement might follow original relative positions (e.g., blobs originally left of base go left in output), or by color order, or to minimize bounding box. Expecteds often have small blobs in a "sidebar" column (e.g., cols 4-8 in train1) stacked vertically, then base, then another group below/right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `get_components` function is solid: it correctly detects 4-connected blobs, computes bounding boxes (bbox as (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)), pixel counts, and positions. It uses a stack for DFS traversal and visited array, handling all blobs efficiently. This is essential for extraction and should be reused.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def get_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    n = 30
    visited = [False] * (n * n)
    components = []
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(n * n):
        r = i // n
        c = i % n
        if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[i]:
            color = g[r][c]
            stack = [i]
            visited[i] = True
            positions = []
            min_r = max_r = r
            min_c = max_c = c
            while stack:
                curr = stack.pop()
                cr = curr // n
                cc = curr % n
                positions.append((cr, cc))
                min_r = min(min_r, cr)
                max_r = max(max_r, cr)
                min_c = min(min_c, cc)
                max_c = max(max_c, cc)
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr = cr + dr
                    nc = cc + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
                        ni = nr * n + nc
                        if not visited[ni] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                            visited[ni] = True
                            stack.append(ni)
            components.append({
                'color': color,
                'positions': positions,
                'bbox': (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c),
                'pixels': len(positions)
            })
    return components
```

No other functions from the attempt are notably helpful; the placement logic (vertical/horizontal stacking) is flawed and should be reworked, not reused directly. The grouping/sorting code is partially useful for ordering but needs integration tweaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it fails both training examples completely (marked INCORRECT), indicating core placement rules are misunderstood.
 * Component extraction works: Base (largest blob, e.g., 8's in train1) is placed correctly in its original relative shape, but small blobs are translated rigidly without fitting into base gaps.
 * Grouping by width and sorting (min_r asc, min_c desc) captures some ordering (e.g., processes top-to-bottom, right-to-left), but application fails: In train1 generated, small blobs (6,4,1,2,3) are scattered below base in rows 19-31 with overlaps/gaps (e.g., 6's in row20 cols1-5, but expected has them stacked neatly in cols4-8 rows9-13 integrated with base); 8's have holes unfilled (e.g., row14 col5-7 empty in generated, but expected fills with 2's). In train2 generated, base 2's are correct in rows8-13, but small 1,3,4 placed below in rows14-23 scattered/misaligned (e.g., 1's in row15 cols10-13 but expected integrates them into base at row13 col11); 3's and 4's detached vs. expected nested.
 * Vertical/horizontal detection works (train1 base is horizontal-ish, places below; train2 vertical, but code has bug in vertical: stacks left but from b_min_r, causing misalignment). Rigid stacking ignores integration: Generated keeps blobs separate, expecteds interlock (e.g., train1 expected has 2's protruding into 8's bbox, 3/4 below as extension).
 * Overflow handling is present but ineffective: Train1 generated has blobs in rows19-31 but wrong positions (e.g., 4's in row19 col6, but expected in row21 col17); some pixels missing or shifted (unknown why, possibly bbox calc error in relative placement).
 * Train1 mismatches: Small blobs not stacked vertically in sidebar (cols4-8); 3/4 group below base in cols16-19 rows19-31 as vertical stack, but generated scatters 3's absent. Train2 mismatches: Small blobs should nest into base (e.g., 1's inside 2's at row13), but generated places separately below; 3/4 in rows16-20 detached vs. expected integrated right.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the entire placement block (if is_vertical else) is broken: It assumes non-integrated stacking, which doesn't match expecteds' merged structures. Don't reuse as-is; focus on gap-filling or attachment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed stacking logic that failed trainings: Small blobs (8's top, then 4's/6's/2's/1's in cols3-8 rows0-20, stacked vertically but rigidly translated) are placed left of a long vertical 3's stack in cols9-16 rows0-29, with no integration (e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols3-7 detached, 6's in rows8-11 cols3-6 separate). This creates a sidebar of small shapes + tall 3's extension, but expecteds from trainings suggest interlocking (e.g., small blobs should fill gaps in base, like 2's into 8's, or nest 1's into larger). No base identified/placed centrally; 3's seem overextended (full height, possibly the "base" but misplaced). It preserves shapes but fails cohesion—looks like separate columns vs. unified structure. Missing: Original relative ordering/integration; likely wrong base (if 3's are largest, should be central with others attached). To handle test, need to detect base gaps and fit small blobs by bbox overlap or adjacency rules.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 00:19:37] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** example (both trains), show clear interaction or effect (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation), and are directly observable without assuming a full puzzle solution. I focused on polyomino-like shapes (defined by color, pixel count, bounding box/position, and holes). No high-level interpretations or total solutions are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., shapes with no positional change or grouping) are excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., exact stacking order by pixel count, which varies) are noted as unknown rather than forced. All examples have holes=0 universally, so this is not listed as an interaction.

1. **Large polyomino (high pixel count >100) → Small polyominoes' position (y-coordinate)**  
   - The large polyomino (e.g., Maroon in Train 1, Red in Train 2) remains completely unchanged (color, pixel count, bounding box).  
   - It anchors small polyominoes (<20 pixels): in every example, all small polyominoes are repositioned such that their y-bounding boxes overlap or directly adjoin the large polyomino's y-range (e.g., Train 1: small stacks at y9-15 and y18-25 overlap large y14-18; Train 2: small stack at y12-19 overlaps large y8-13). No small polyominoes remain isolated from this vertical proximity.  
   - Effect: This creates vertical adjacency or overlap, influencing small polyomino movement toward the large one's y-position. Specific overlap depth or exact y-offset is unknown (varies slightly).

2. **Small polyominoes' input positions → Output x-alignment (grouping into stacks)**  
   - Small polyominoes preserve individual properties (color and pixel count unchanged).  
   - Input x-positions (left/mid vs. right) consistently affect output grouping: small polyominoes are realigned into 1+ vertical stacks with shared/narrow x-ranges (e.g., Train 1: left stack x4-8, right stack x16-19; Train 2: single stack x9-12). All small polyominoes participate in at least one stack.  
   - Effect: Input x-position determines stack assignment (e.g., left-input shapes tend toward leftish x in output), creating horizontal alignment. Exact x-value calculation (e.g., median or fixed offset) is unknown (varies by example). No single small polyomino remains ungrouped.

3. **Small polyominoes' positions (y) → Sequential stacking**  
   - Small polyominoes' output y-positions interact with each other: they are adjusted to form sequential vertical stacks (increasing y, often with slight overlap or adjacency between consecutive shapes).  
   - Effect: This transforms scattered input y-positions into ordered y-sequences within each x-aligned stack (e.g., Train 1 left: y9-10 → y10-12 → y12-15; Train 2: y12-15 → y15-18 → y17-19). Pixel count does not consistently dictate order (e.g., increasing in some stacks, not others), so no pixel → y-order interaction. Specific sequencing rule (e.g., by input y or color) is unknown.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no color → color changes; no pixel count → size transformation; no holes involved since all are 0; no shape-specific effects like "L-shape → rotation" observable across both examples). Elements like the test input were not analyzed for connections, as the task focuses on trains for consistency.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 00:21:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (Train 1 and Train 2), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** example (both trains), show clear interaction or effect (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation), and are directly observable without assuming a full puzzle solution. I focused on polyomino-like shapes (defined by color, pixel count, bounding box/position, and holes). No high-level interpretations or total solutions are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., shapes with no positional change or grouping) are excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., exact stacking order by pixel count, which varies) are noted as unknown rather than forced. All examples have holes=0 universally, so this is not listed as an interaction.

1. **Large polyomino (high pixel count >100) → Small polyominoes' position (y-coordinate)**  
   - The large polyomino (e.g., Maroon in Train 1, Red in Train 2) remains completely unchanged (color, pixel count, bounding box).  
   - It anchors small polyominoes (<20 pixels): in every example, all small polyominoes are repositioned such that their y-bounding boxes overlap or directly adjoin the large polyomino's y-range (e.g., Train 1: small stacks at y9-15 and y18-25 overlap large y14-18; Train 2: small stack at y12-19 overlaps large y8-13). No small polyominoes remain isolated from this vertical proximity.  
   - Effect: This creates vertical adjacency or overlap, influencing small polyomino movement toward the large one's y-position. Specific overlap depth or exact y-offset is unknown (varies slightly).

2. **Small polyominoes' input positions → Output x-alignment (grouping into stacks)**  
   - Small polyominoes preserve individual properties (color and pixel count unchanged).  
   - Input x-positions (left/mid vs. right) consistently affect output grouping: small polyominoes are realigned into 1+ vertical stacks with shared/narrow x-ranges (e.g., Train 1: left stack x4-8, right stack x16-19; Train 2: single stack x9-12). All small polyominoes participate in at least one stack.  
   - Effect: Input x-position determines stack assignment (e.g., left-input shapes tend toward leftish x in output), creating horizontal alignment. Exact x-value calculation (e.g., median or fixed offset) is unknown (varies by example). No single small polyomino remains ungrouped.

3. **Small polyominoes' positions (y) → Sequential stacking**  
   - Small polyominoes' output y-positions interact with each other: they are adjusted to form sequential vertical stacks (increasing y, often with slight overlap or adjacency between consecutive shapes).  
   - Effect: This transforms scattered input y-positions into ordered y-sequences within each x-aligned stack (e.g., Train 1 left: y9-10 → y10-12 → y12-15; Train 2: y12-15 → y15-18 → y17-19). Pixel count does not consistently dictate order (e.g., increasing in some stacks, not others), so no pixel → y-order interaction. Specific sequencing rule (e.g., by input y or color) is unknown.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no color → color changes; no pixel count → size transformation; no holes involved since all are 0; no shape-specific effects like "L-shape → rotation" observable across both examples). Elements like the test input were not analyzed for connections, as the task focuses on trains for consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 00:31:38] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (polyominoes) of the same color, preserve the largest central component unchanged, clear or ignore smaller ones initially, and then rearrange the smaller components (size >=2 and typically < half the large one's size) into ordered stacks or attachments on the left and/or right sides of the large component, positioned relative to its vertical center with specific horizontal and vertical offsets based on color, size, or original position, while preserving their shapes and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The large component is the biggest connected group by cell count (not by color priority), and it must remain in its exact original position and shape; everything else is cleared before placing smalls.
 * Small components are only those with 2+ cells, connected by 4-directional adjacency (up/down/left/right), same color, and size < large_size // 2; single cells or tiny groups (<2) are ignored entirely.
 * Grouping smalls by approximate horizontal position: left side (avg column <15) vs. right side (avg column >=15), assuming a 30-column grid.
 * Within each group, sort by color ascending, then by vertical center (row average) ascending for stacking order.
 * Stacking: Place stacks vertically offset from the large component's vertical center (e.g., large_center_y ± (6 + order * 4)), at fixed x-centers (e.g., 6 for left, 17.5 for right); preserve shape via translation (shift by delta row/col, round to integers), but this can cause distortions if shapes don't align perfectly or if rounding clips cells.
 * Placement must check grid bounds and overwrite only zeros (no merging or overlapping with existing pixels); if translation causes out-of-bounds or overlaps, it may silently clip or fail.
 * Subtle: Vertical offset calculation uses comp_height incorrectly in the code (comp_center_r - min_row, but this isn't used properly); stacks should mimic "attachment" or "piling" without rotating or reshaping, but order might prioritize color over y-position in some cases.
 * Grid is 30 columns wide, variable rows (e.g., 30x30?); empty rows at top/bottom in outputs suggest vertical centering or trimming isn't needed.
 * Colors are treated distinctly but sorting is by color value (1<2<...<8); no rotation or mirroring of shapes.
 * Potential misses: Some smalls might attach directly to large (e.g., integrated in expected), not just stacked separately; offsets like 4.0 units per stack item ensure spacing; right-side stacks may shift further (e.g., +17.5 col center).
 * All attempts clear non-large pixels first, which works for isolation but fails if expected integrates smalls into/around large without full clearing.
 * Connected components must ignore different colors (only same-color adjacency).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly detects all connected components and identifies the large one (e.g., the 8's in train1, 2's in train2), preserving it unchanged.
 * Clearing non-large pixels works to isolate the large component but fails because expected outputs rearrange smalls without fully clearing—smalls are placed in new positions but sometimes integrated or attached directly to the large one (e.g., 1's and 2's embedded in/around 8's in train1 expected).
 * Grouping by x-position (<15 left, else right) is partially helpful but too rigid— in train1 generated, all smalls (2's,4's,1's,3's) end up in awkward left/right stacks, but expected has 1's/2's on left integrated vertically with large, and 3's/4's stacked below as separate groups.
 * Sorting by color then y-center works for ordering but offset calculation is broken: get_target_center_y uses incorrect comp_height (comp_center_r - min(p[0])), leading to misaligned vertical positions (e.g., in train1 generated, 2's and 4's stacks are too high/low relative to 8's center ~row 16-17).
 * Translation and placement preserve shapes but rounding causes slight shifts/distortions (e.g., in train1 generated, 4's L-shape becomes misaligned at rows 4-8 left, not matching expected integrated positions); no overlap handling with large, causing potential overwrites.
 * In train1 generated: Large 8's correct, but smalls placed as separate stacks (4's left high, 2's left mid, 1's/3's bottom scattered) vs. expected (1's/2's woven into large at rows 10-14 left, 3's/4's as tight stacks bottom rows 20-29 rightish, with some 6's? wait, expected has 6's/1's/2's mixed left mid).
 * In train2 generated: Large 2's correct at rows 8-13, but smalls (4's top,1's mid-left,3's bottom) placed scattered vs. expected (1's/3's/4's stacked right bottom rows 14-20, integrated with 2's extensions at row 13 cols 10-13/21-22).
 * find_small_polyominoes filters correctly (< large//2, >=2) but misses that some smalls might be same-color as large or need different size thresholds.
 * clear_non_large_pixels is helpful for isolation but over-applies—expected keeps smalls' info for rearrangement without clearing until placement.
 * group_by_x_position and sort_by_color are directionally useful but hardcoded thresholds (15 col, 6/17.5 x-centers) fail for varying grid positions (e.g., train2 smalls all leftish but expected right-stacked).
 * get_stack_center_x and get_target_center_y have right idea (left/right, offset stacking) but offsets (6+order*4) too large/spaced, causing gaps/misalignments (e.g., train1 generated has huge empty spaces above/below stacks).
 * place_component is basic but lacks overlap avoidance with large or other smalls, leading to silent failures (e.g., if translated pos hits large, it overwrites to small color).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction and basic rearrangement but botches positioning/offsets, leading to all INCORRECT; no rotation/merging considered, which might be needed for integration.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it keeps a large block of 3's (rows 0-29 cols 9-15, size ~200+ cells) as central, which seems right, but places smalls (6's as scattered tetrominoes rows 2-7 left, 4's as polyomino rows 7-10 left/mid) overlapping or adjacent to large without proper stacking, then dumps 1's (row 20 right), 2's (rows 23-26 right), 8's (rows 27-29 right) as horizontal stacks below/right, creating a cluttered bottom without vertical alignment to large's center (~row 14-15).
 * Differences: Expected likely has smalls (1,2,4,6,8) stacked neatly left/right of large 3's center, ordered by color (1 then 2 left, 4/6/8 right?), with 4-unit vertical spacing, no overlaps, and shapes preserved (e.g., 6's I-shape vertical left, 4's S-shape attached mid-right); generated has misaligned x-centers (all smalls hugging left of large), incorrect y-offsets (bottom dumps too low, no centering), and possible clipping (8's at row 29 may bound out). This doesn't match puzzle rules as stacks aren't symmetrically attached/ordered relative to large.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 00:31:51] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

#### Components Identified
- **Large bar component**: A single component per puzzle with high pixel count (>100), wide horizontal bounding box (large Δx, small Δy, spanning most or all x-range), and solid fill (holes=0). Examples: Maroon (138 pixels, bbox Δx=29, Δy=4), Red (151 pixels, bbox Δx=29, Δy=5). This component is present in every train example.
- **Small shape components**: Multiple components per puzzle with low pixel count (<20), compact bounding boxes (small Δx and Δy), and solid fill (holes=0). These have consistent colors across examples (e.g., Blue ~9 pixels, Green variants 8 or 10 pixels, Yellow 8 or 12 pixels, Red 10 or 12 pixels, Pink ~8-10 pixels), but pixel count varies slightly by instance/shape. These are present in every train example (4-6 per puzzle).

No other components (e.g., no isolated or irrelevant elements) show consistent presence or interaction across both trains. Semantic shapes (e.g., L-tetromino) cannot be definitively identified from provided data alone, as pixel counts and bboxes allow ambiguity (e.g., Yellow 12 pixels could be L or H/I tetromino); no forced connections based on assumed semantics.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
These are limited to obvious, direct effects observed in **both** train inputs/outputs. Only properties that change or relate consistently are included. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant elements (e.g., non-interacting isolates) are inferred.

1. **Preservation of identity properties across position changes**:
   - Small shape components retain color, pixel count, and holes=0 when their positions change.
   - Effect: Pixel count and color act as unique identifiers linking input instances to output instances (e.g., Blue always 9 pixels, moves from input bbox to new output bbox; Green 10 pixels moves similarly). This is consistent for all small shapes in both trains.
   - Large bar component retains all properties (color, pixels, bbox, holes=0) unchanged.
   - No effect on large bar from small shapes; no color/pixel changes anywhere.

2. **Positional transformation of small shapes relative to large bar**:
   - Small shape input positions (bbox x/y) affect output positions: All small shapes except possibly some below-large isolates (see unknowns) are relocated (Δx and Δy changes) to new bboxes.
   - Effect: Output positions create y-range adjacency or overlap with the large bar's fixed y-range. In both trains:
     - Train 1: Stacks overlap (e.g., y9-15 overlaps large y14-18) or adjoin (e.g., y18-24 adjoins large y18).
     - Train 2: Stack overlaps (e.g., y12-19 overlaps large y8-13) and extends beyond.
   - Connection: Small shapes "attach" to large bar via y-position interaction (overlap/adjacency ensures vertical alignment/connectivity in silhouette). x-position of attachment varies (e.g., x4-8 vs. x9-12), so no consistent x-effect.
   - Consistent across all small shapes that move (all in train 2; most in train 1).

3. **Grouping and alignment of small shapes into vertical stacks**:
   - Multiple small shapes are grouped (2-3 per stack in trains) and realigned such that all in a group share identical x-bbox min/max (uniform column width).
   - Effect: y-bboxes are adjusted to be consecutive/adjacent (no gaps or minimal overlap, e.g., one ends y15, next starts y15; forms continuous vertical chain). This transforms individual positions into a connected vertical structure.
   - Connection: Grouped small shapes interact via position (y-adjacency creates silhouette connection; shared x-bbox enforces horizontal alignment). Observed in both trains (1 stack in train 2; 2 stacks in train 1).
   - Pixels/colors preserved within groups, but grouping does not affect large bar.

#### Unknowns / Non-Consistent or Unexplainable
- **Grouping criteria**: How small shapes are selected for stacks (e.g., by input x/y position, color, or pixels) is not obvious or consistent. E.g., train 1 groups Pink/Blue/Red (mixed input positions) separately from Green/Yellow; train 2 groups all (Blue/Green/Yellow). No explainable transformation rule (e.g., input y-order does not consistently map to stack order).
- **Stack x-position and count**: x-placement of stacks varies (left/center/right columns); number of stacks varies (1 vs. 2). No consistent effect from input positions or large bar's x.
- **Order within stacks**: Vertical sequencing (top-to-bottom y) has no obvious consistent rule (e.g., not strictly by input y-min, pixels, or color).
- **Handling of non-attached small shapes**: One small shape (Green 10 pixels, below large with y-gap) remains unchanged and non-interacting in train 1; no equivalent in train 2. Not consistent, so no interaction identified.
- **Shape-specific effects**: No consistent connections via pixels/shape properties (e.g., 8-pixel vs. 12-pixel) affecting movement or grouping; all low-pixel shapes behave similarly.
- **Large bar orientation**: Horizontal in both trains (wide x, narrow y); no data on vertical larges (as in test) affecting interactions.

No other connections (e.g., color-to-position, holes-to-anything, or irrelevant elements) are obvious or consistent. All identified interactions preserve component integrity without solving the puzzle.

[2025-10-02 00:33:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

#### Components Identified
- **Large bar component**: A single component per puzzle with high pixel count (>100), wide horizontal bounding box (large Δx, small Δy, spanning most or all x-range), and solid fill (holes=0). Examples: Maroon (138 pixels, bbox Δx=29, Δy=4), Red (151 pixels, bbox Δx=29, Δy=5). This component is present in every train example.
- **Small shape components**: Multiple components per puzzle with low pixel count (<20), compact bounding boxes (small Δx and Δy), and solid fill (holes=0). These have consistent colors across examples (e.g., Blue ~9 pixels, Green variants 8 or 10 pixels, Yellow 8 or 12 pixels, Red 10 or 12 pixels, Pink ~8-10 pixels), but pixel count varies slightly by instance/shape. These are present in every train example (4-6 per puzzle).

No other components (e.g., no isolated or irrelevant elements) show consistent presence or interaction across both trains. Semantic shapes (e.g., L-tetromino) cannot be definitively identified from provided data alone, as pixel counts and bboxes allow ambiguity (e.g., Yellow 12 pixels could be L or H/I tetromino); no forced connections based on assumed semantics.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
These are limited to obvious, direct effects observed in **both** train inputs/outputs. Only properties that change or relate consistently are included. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant elements (e.g., non-interacting isolates) are inferred.

1. **Preservation of identity properties across position changes**:
   - Small shape components retain color, pixel count, and holes=0 when their positions change.
   - Effect: Pixel count and color act as unique identifiers linking input instances to output instances (e.g., Blue always 9 pixels, moves from input bbox to new output bbox; Green 10 pixels moves similarly). This is consistent for all small shapes in both trains.
   - Large bar component retains all properties (color, pixels, bbox, holes=0) unchanged.
   - No effect on large bar from small shapes; no color/pixel changes anywhere.

2. **Positional transformation of small shapes relative to large bar**:
   - Small shape input positions (bbox x/y) affect output positions: All small shapes except possibly some below-large isolates (see unknowns) are relocated (Δx and Δy changes) to new bboxes.
   - Effect: Output positions create y-range adjacency or overlap with the large bar's fixed y-range. In both trains:
     - Train 1: Stacks overlap (e.g., y9-15 overlaps large y14-18) or adjoin (e.g., y18-24 adjoins large y18).
     - Train 2: Stack overlaps (e.g., y12-19 overlaps large y8-13) and extends beyond.
   - Connection: Small shapes "attach" to large bar via y-position interaction (overlap/adjacency ensures vertical alignment/connectivity in silhouette). x-position of attachment varies (e.g., x4-8 vs. x9-12), so no consistent x-effect.
   - Consistent across all small shapes that move (all in train 2; most in train 1).

3. **Grouping and alignment of small shapes into vertical stacks**:
   - Multiple small shapes are grouped (2-3 per stack in trains) and realigned such that all in a group share identical x-bbox min/max (uniform column width).
   - Effect: y-bboxes are adjusted to be consecutive/adjacent (no gaps or minimal overlap, e.g., one ends y15, next starts y15; forms continuous vertical chain). This transforms individual positions into a connected vertical structure.
   - Connection: Grouped small shapes interact via position (y-adjacency creates silhouette connection; shared x-bbox enforces horizontal alignment). Observed in both trains (1 stack in train 2; 2 stacks in train 1).
   - Pixels/colors preserved within groups, but grouping does not affect large bar.

#### Unknowns / Non-Consistent or Unexplainable
- **Grouping criteria**: How small shapes are selected for stacks (e.g., by input x/y position, color, or pixels) is not obvious or consistent. E.g., train 1 groups Pink/Blue/Red (mixed input positions) separately from Green/Yellow; train 2 groups all (Blue/Green/Yellow). No explainable transformation rule (e.g., input y-order does not consistently map to stack order).
- **Stack x-position and count**: x-placement of stacks varies (left/center/right columns); number of stacks varies (1 vs. 2). No consistent effect from input positions or large bar's x.
- **Order within stacks**: Vertical sequencing (top-to-bottom y) has no obvious consistent rule (e.g., not strictly by input y-min, pixels, or color).
- **Handling of non-attached small shapes**: One small shape (Green 10 pixels, below large with y-gap) remains unchanged and non-interacting in train 1; no equivalent in train 2. Not consistent, so no interaction identified.
- **Shape-specific effects**: No consistent connections via pixels/shape properties (e.g., 8-pixel vs. 12-pixel) affecting movement or grouping; all low-pixel shapes behave similarly.
- **Large bar orientation**: Horizontal in both trains (wide x, narrow y); no data on vertical larges (as in test) affecting interactions.

No other connections (e.g., color-to-position, holes-to-anything, or irrelevant elements) are obvious or consistent. All identified interactions preserve component integrity without solving the puzzle.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 30x30 grid involving colored connected components (blobs of the same number/color), where the goal is to identify the largest "large" component, rearrange the smaller "small" components (size <20, excluding large size) by stacking them adjacent to the large one (vertically below if large is horizontal, horizontally to the right if vertical), sorted by color, while removing the original small components from the grid, and potentially integrating some smalls into or overwriting parts of the large component to form a new arrangement that matches a target scene or pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) of the same color/value; diagonals do not count.
 * The "large" component is the one with maximum size (number of cells); if ties, max() picks the first or arbitrary, but in examples, it's clear.
 * Small components are filtered as size <20 and size != large_size; this excludes the large and any medium/large duplicates, but may miss if there are multiples of large size.
 * Orientation check: Large is "horizontal" if (max_col - min_col +1) > (max_row - min_row +1); else vertical. This determines stacking direction (vertical stack below for horizontal large, horizontal stack right for vertical large).
 * Stacking: Small components are sorted by color ascending. For vertical stack (below horizontal large), align to large's min_col, start at large max_row +1, place each small shifted (dy to current_row, dx to align min_col), but constrain to a "common_width" (max width of smalls) and check bounds; increment current_row by small's height. For horizontal stack (right of vertical large), align to a fixed center_row ~13-15 with common_height=4, start at large max_col +1, shift dx to current_col, dy to align, constrain to common_height rows, increment current_col by small's width.
 * Removal: After placement, set original small positions to 0; this must happen after all placements to avoid overwriting new spots, but code does it last.
 * Subtleties: In expected outputs, some small components appear "integrated" or overwriting parts of the large (e.g., in train 1, 1/2/6 shapes cut into/near 8's in rows 9-13 and 14-15; in train 2, 1 integrated into 2's in row 13-14). Stacking is not always simple alignment—e.g., in train 1 expected, 3/4 stack in columns 16-19 starting row 19, interwoven shapes (not just shifted copies), right-aligned to large. In train 2, 3/4 stack vertically in columns 9-12 rows 15-20, but with specific offsets. Common dimensions (width/height) are assumed but not always max—may need per-component fitting or fixed sizes (e.g., height=4). Placement may overlap or modify large (not just adjacent). Originals must be fully removed, but generated often leaves them (e.g., bottom rows in train 1). Grid bounds (0-29) must be respected; out-of-bounds ignored. Colors are integers 1-8 typically. Multiple smalls of same color? Code treats as separate if disconnected. Queue in find_components appends without check, leading to inefficient/infinite if not bounded, but visited prevents. Flat_positions iterates all, good for full scan.
 * Easy to miss: Integration/overwriting large (not just stacking adjacent); exact alignment may be to large's right edge or center, not min_col; stacking may interleave shapes (e.g., train 1 row20: 4 3 3 4); common_height/width hardcoded or max may not fit expected (train 2 uses ~4 height but specific positions); removal must target only smalls, not large; if no smalls, return copy unchanged.
 * All considerations: Bugs in shifting (e.g., dy/current_row wrong, leading to top placement instead of below); constraint checks (new_col < common_min_col + width) may clip shapes; sorting by color works but expected may reverse or group same color; horizontal stack centers at row 13 but expected may differ (train 2 stacks lower); vertical large not tested well (train 1 large is horizontal, train 2 is horizontal too? Wait, train 2 large 2's rows 8-12 cols 0-29, width=30>height=5, horizontal).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component finding and basic extraction are helpful but buggy in queue/visited. Placement and removal need fixes. Types like Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int,int]]] for (color, size, min_col, max_col, min_row, max_row, positions) are useful for bounding box + pos list.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    n = 30
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    flat_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    for pos in flat_positions:
        i, j = pos
        if g[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
            color = g[i][j]
            size = 0
            positions = []
            queue = deque([(i, j)])
            visited[i][j] = True
            while queue:
                x, y = queue.popleft()
                if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] == color and not visited[x][y]:
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    size += 1
                    positions.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        queue.append((nx, ny))  # Note: appends even out-of-bounds, but if-check skips; inefficient but works with visited.
            if size > 0:
                min_row = min(p[0] for p in positions)
                max_row = max(p[0] for p in positions)
                min_col = min(p[1] for p in positions)
                max_col = max(p[1] for p in positions)
                components.append((color, size, min_col, max_col, min_row, max_row, positions))  # Typo in code: 7th is missing, but append has 6 + positions=7 items? Wait, tuple has 7 + list.
    return components
```

```python
def get_large(components: List[Tuple]) -> Tuple:
    return max(components, key=lambda c: c[1])

def get_small(components: List[Tuple], large: Tuple) -> List[Tuple]:
    large_size = large[1]
    return [c for c in components if c[1] < 20 and c[1] != large_size]
```

```python
def is_horizontal(large: Tuple) -> bool:
    _, _, min_col, max_col, min_row, max_row = large[:6]
    dx = max_col - min_col + 1
    dy = max_row - min_row + 1
    return dx > dy
```

```python
def sort_small_by_color(small: List[Tuple]) -> List[Tuple]:
    return sorted(small, key=lambda c: c[0])
```

```python
def remove_original_small(h: List[List[int]], small: List[Tuple]):
    n = 30
    for c in small:
        _, _, _, _, _, _, c_pos = c
        for row, col in c_pos:
            if 0 <= row < n and 0 <= col < n:
                h[row][col] = 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction and basic stacking logic but fails on placement position, removal, and integration.
 * Component finding works for identifying blobs/sizes/bounds/positions, but queue appends unbounded neighbors (inefficient, but visited bounds it); helpful for extraction.
 * get_large and get_small are correct for selecting large and filtering smalls (<20, != large_size), matching examples (e.g., train 1 large=8 size~100+, smalls 3/4 size~10-15; train 2 large=2 size~120, smalls 1/3/4 <20).
 * is_horizontal correctly detects orientation (train 1/2 both horizontal, so vertical stack attempted).
 * sort_small_by_color works (e.g., train 1 sorts 3 then 4; train 2 sorts 1,3,4).
 * Placement functions (place_vertical_stack, place_horizontal_stack) have logic for shifting positions (dx/dy based on alignment) and bounds check, but buggy: in vertical_stack, current_row starts at large max_row+1 but generated places at top (rows 2-6 vs expected 19+); dx aligns to large min_col but clips to common_width, leading to partial/misplaced shapes (train 1: 4/3 in cols 7-11 rows 2-6, incomplete). Horizontal_stack assumes common_height=4 and center_row=13, but untested (both trains horizontal large); may clip vertically.
 * remove_original_small is correct in intent (set small pos to 0) but fails in generated (e.g., train 1 leaves 1/2/3/6 at bottom rows 22-29 and row 8; train 2 leaves 1 at top rows 1-4, 3/4 at bottom); possibly because components list includes non-smalls or placement overwrites incompletely, or bug in pos list.
 * No integration handled: Expected overwrites large with some smalls (train 1: 1/2/6 in rows 9-13 cols4-8, 2's in large rows14-15; train 2: 1 in large row13 cols10/12); code only stacks adjacent, no overwriting large.
 * compute_common_width uses max small width, helpful for alignment but too loose (expected stacks tighter, e.g., train 1 cols16-19 width=4 < max small width~5).
 * Overall, extraction tools essential and mostly correct; placement/removal broken; no handling for shape-specific offsets or interleaving in stack (e.g., train 1 row20: alternating 4/3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be mostly the original input grid with partial overwriting or misplaced smalls (e.g., 3's dominant in center cols9-15 rows0-29, like large 3; 8's shifted right cols18-22 rows3-6; 6's left bottom rows13-16 cols0-3; 2's row17 col21-23; 1's bottom right rows25-28 col22-23), but originals not removed (e.g., overlapping 3's everywhere, 4's scattered rows4-7 cols3-7). This suggests failed removal and incorrect shifting, similar to trains—stacking attempted but positions wrong (e.g., not cleanly below/right of large, no integration). Expected likely has clean stack of smalls (1,2,4,6,8? sorted 1,2,4,6,8) adjacent to large 3, with originals gone and possible overwriting (e.g., smalls cut into 3's or stacked tightly cols16+ rows large_end+1). Without exact expected, it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle—messy overlaps, no clear sorted stack, bounds violated implicitly.

[2025-10-02 00:43:36] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 00:44:55] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two train examples (the only complete input-output pairs provided), below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions or connections** between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **both** train examples (i.e., consistent across EVERY puzzle). I focused solely on patterns in positions, bounding boxes (bbox), pixel counts, holes, and colors that show clear cause-effect or relational changes (e.g., one element's position affecting another's repositioning) between input and output. 

- **Irrelevant or non-consistent elements excluded**: Orange and Purple elements are described but do not appear in either train, so no connections identified. Background (black void with implied grid) is static and does not interact dynamically (e.g., no color/position changes affecting it). Single isolated properties like raw shape names (e.g., L-shaped) are not used unless tied to a consistent interaction. No high-level puzzle solution or full rearrangement logic is inferred—only direct, observable links.
- **Unknowns called out**: Exact ordering within stacks (e.g., why Blue precedes Green in one case but not another) is unknown, as it varies without a clear consistent rule (e.g., not always by pixel count, color, or input y-position). Number of stacks (1 vs. 2) and their exact x-positions relative to the fixed element vary (e.g., left/right split in train 1 but centered in train 2), so no consistent rule for stack placement or count. No consistent color-to-color interactions (e.g., Green always affecting Yellow) due to varying element sets. No evidence of hole count affecting anything (all holes=0 unchanged). Shape-specific transformations (e.g., rotation causing bbox width/height swaps) cannot be explained consistently, as bbox changes are present but not rule-bound across cases.

#### 1. **Fixed Large Element → All Small Elements (Position Anchoring Interaction)**
   - **Components involved**: The single largest-pixel-count element with full horizontal span (bbox x from ~0 to ~29, pixels ~140-150, height ~4-5 units; color varies—Maroon in train 1, Red in train 2).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: This fixed element remains completely unchanged (same bbox, pixels, holes=0, color, position). It acts as a static anchor affecting **all small elements** (pixels 8-12, all other colors): small elements' positions are transformed (bbox x/y fully changed) to new locations where their y-ranges directly interface with the fixed element's y-range via adjacency or overlap (e.g., small stack starts/ends within 1-3 units of fixed y-start/end). No small element remains in its input position relative to the fixed one.
   - **Properties linked**: Fixed element's y-position → small elements' new y-position (causal: smalls "attach" via y-overlap/adjacency; e.g., train 1 fixed y14-18 overlaps left stack y9-15 and adjoins right stack y18-25; train 2 fixed y8-13 overlaps stack y12-19). Fixed element's x-span (full width) → small stacks' narrow x-width (3-4 units, non-spanning).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in both trains; no exceptions. Small elements preserve their own pixels/holes/color but lose input position independence due to this anchoring.

#### 2. **Small Elements → Small Elements (Stacking Alignment Interaction)**
   - **Components involved**: All small elements (pixels 8-12, colors: Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink, Red [when small]; holes=0).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Small elements interact with each other by being repositioned into 1+ vertical stacks (narrow x-range of 3-4 units, sequential y-ranges with minimal/no gaps or slight overlaps of 1-2 units). Each small element's individual bbox changes (x/y shifted), but they align y-sequentially within stacks, forming a chained vertical composition. This affects movement: input-scattered positions become output-aligned, with no small element isolated (all participate in at least one stack).
   - **Properties linked**: One small element's new y-end → next small element's y-start (causal: sequential stacking; e.g., train 1 left stack: Pink y9-10 → Blue y10-12 → Red y12-15; train 2 stack: Blue y12-15 → Green y15-18 → Yellow y17-19). Small elements' input positions → output stack narrowness (input varied x-widths ~3-8 units compress to consistent 3-4 unit x in stacks). Pixel count preserved per element but indirectly links to stack height (total stack y-span ~6-9 units across 3 elements).
   - **Consistency**: All small elements form stacks in both trains; stacking is vertical and grid-aligned in outputs (implied by integer bbox coords and polyomino pixels). No small element changes color/pixels/holes due to stacking.

#### 3. **Fixed Large Element + Small Elements → Overall Grid Alignment (Background-Implied Interaction)**
   - **Components involved**: Fixed large element, all small elements, and implied grid (from polyomino pixel alignment and bbox integers).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The fixed element's horizontal span enforces grid alignment for small elements' output positions (smalls shift to grid-snapped bboxes). Smalls' stacking extends this, creating output compositions aligned to the fixed element's grid (no floating or misaligned elements).
   - **Properties linked**: Fixed element's bbox (x0-~29, y-mid) + smalls' pixels (polyomino totals) → output bbox integers (causal: all elements snap to implied grid; e.g., stack x-starts at 4/9/16, y-ends align to fixed y-boundaries).
   - **Consistency**: Outputs in both trains show grid-aligned rearrangements (scattered inputs become stacked/composed); no deviations.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no position → color changes, no hole/pixel effects on movement, no specific shape-edge/silhouette links across cases). These are the only obvious, direct connections observable in both trains. For the test input, the large element appears to be Green (pixels=192, tall y-span 0-29), which would likely anchor smalls (Yellow, Pink, Red, Blue, small Maroon) similarly, but exact stack details remain unknown without output.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 00:44:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids (though many rows are empty) where cells contain integers (0 for empty, 1-8 for colored or typed "objects" forming connected shapes or blobs), and the goal is to transform the input grid into a new output grid by identifying, extracting, and repositioning these objects according to specific rules—likely involving sorting by type/number, aligning them in a canonical order (e.g., top-to-bottom by number, left-justified), preserving shape but relocating them, and filling empty space with 0s, while possibly merging or modifying interactions between overlapping or adjacent blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects appear to be 4-connected or 8-connected groups (blobs) of the same number; e.g., in training example 1, the 4's form a cross-like shape that gets relocated intact to the bottom, the 3's form a partial square that moves down, the 6's become a horizontal bar with 1's integrated, and 8's form a large background with embedded 2's and 3's adjusted.
 * Relocation seems rule-based: blobs are extracted and placed in a sorted order (lowest to highest number?) starting from the top or bottom, but with position-specific adjustments—e.g., in training 1 expected, low numbers (1,2,6) go to rows 9-14, 8's to 14-18 with embeds, 3/4's to bottom rows 19-29; in training 2, 1's go to top, 2's stay mid with embeds, 3/4's to bottom.
 * Subtle elements: Blobs may overlap or embed during relocation (e.g., 2's inside 8's in train 1, 1's inside 2's and 3's in train 2); empty rows are preserved or collapsed minimally; shapes must retain exact connectivity and size but can rotate/flip? (no evidence yet); numbers indicate type, and 0s are background—overwriting rules prioritize higher/lower numbers? Unknown if diagonal connectivity counts.
 * Interactions: In expected outputs, some blobs are "cut" or modified (e.g., train 1 generated has intact 4's in top but expected clears them to 0s and moves elsewhere; train 2 generated keeps 1's partial but expected integrates 1's into 2's and adds 3/4 below).
 * Grid size/consistency: Always 30 rows x 30 cols; many rows all-0s, but outputs preserve structure without unnecessary padding.
 * Potential misses: Identity copy ignores all transformations; no blob detection means shapes stay in original positions; sorting order unclear (by min number? size? appearance order?); embedding rules subtle (e.g., 3's replace some 8's in train 1 row 18).
 * All considerations: Use flood-fill for blob extraction; track blob type, bounding box, and relative positions; possible canonical placement like stacking vertically by type; handle multi-blob same-type merges? (not seen); test for rotation (e.g., 4's vertical in input become horizontal? No, seem preserved).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions in this attempt—the program is a simple identity copy, which doesn't extract or manipulate anything.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (identity copy) failed both training examples completely by returning the input unchanged, missing all transformations like clearing upper shapes to 0s, relocating blobs (e.g., train 1: generated keeps 4's/3's in rows 3-6 but expected clears to all-0s and moves 6/1/2 to rows 9-14, 3/4 to 19-29; train 2: generated keeps 1's in rows 1-4 and 3's partial in 22-25 but expected integrates 1's into 2's at row 13, places 3/4 stacked at 15-20).
 * What worked: Nothing substantive—copy preserves grid structure and 0s, but that's trivial and irrelevant.
 * What didn't work: No object detection or movement, so all blobs stay in place (e.g., train 1 generated has 8's intact in rows 14-18 but expected embeds 2's and adjusts 3's; differences unknown but clearly positional); ignores sorting/relocation rules, leading to mismatches in 90%+ of non-0 cells.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this demonstrates zero understanding—no functions for blob extraction (essential for identifying connected groups like the 4-cross or 3-L shapes).
 * Function `program` (identity copy) is broken and not helpful—don't use it; replace with blob-flood-fill logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of an input grid with 3's forming a large vertical/horizontal structure across rows 0-29 (e.g., solid 3-bars in cols 9-15), 4's scattered in rows 4-7, 8's in row 3 cols 18-21 and row 5 cols 19-22, 6's building left in rows 14-17, 2's in rows 17-20 cols 21-24, 1's in row 25 cols 23, but with no transformations.
 * It does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no clearing of upper 3/4/8 to 0s and restacking by type; 6's/2's/1's not integrated or moved up; 3's not condensed to bottom). Looks incorrect because it retains original positions without relocation/embedding (e.g., 3's dominate mid-grid but should likely be sorted/aligned like train 2's 3/4 stack); unclear why 6's build incrementally leftward or 2's appear partial—probably input copy, not rule-applied.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-8 representing colors), where connected components of the same color form "objects" that must be rearranged: identify the largest object as the "base," attempt to fit smaller objects into empty spaces ("holes") within or around the base without overlapping, and stack any unfitted objects below the base in a stable, column-based manner (like Tetris stacking), ensuring no overlaps and respecting grid boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * The base is always the largest (by cell count) connected component; if ties, the code picks by index, but this may need sorting by size first.
 * "Holes" likely refer to empty (0) cells enclosed by or adjacent to the base, but the current implementation incorrectly includes all neighboring cells (even occupied ones) without verifying emptiness, leading to invalid placement targets.
 * Placement into holes requires translating the entire small object rigidly (preserving relative positions) so its anchor (top-left cell) aligns with a hole, ensuring no out-of-bounds, no overlaps with existing blocks (including base), and possibly only within the base's row/column span for "fitting."
 * If no hole fit, stack below: align under the base's column range (e.g., min to max column, or a fixed width like 6), compute a "skyline" of the highest occupied row per column below the base, drop the object to rest on the skyline without overlaps, and update the skyline.
 * Subtlety: Stacking may require sorting small objects by color or size; current code sorts below_components by color, but expected outputs suggest placement order affects stability (e.g., larger first or by anchor position).
 * Grid is 30x30, but objects are small; ensure placements don't wrap or go out of bounds.
 * Expected outputs show complete rearrangement: small objects are either embedded in base (e.g., filling gaps with matching shapes) or stacked neatly below in a compact formation, often with empty space above and around.
 * Overlaps must be strictly avoided, even with non-base objects; clearing original positions before placing is correct, but current code only clears if placed.
 * Potential miss: Base may have irregular shapes, so holes aren't simple perimeters—true holes are enclosed empties (use flood-fill from edges to find internal voids).
 * Anchors: Using top-left (min row, min col in that row) is reasonable but may fail for irregular shapes; relative deltas must preserve object connectivity and shape exactly.
 * Sorting small components: Current sort by min row then min col may not match expected order (e.g., by color, size, or left-to-right).
 * Skyline for stacking: Current implementation initializes to base_max_r but should start from base bottom +1; it scans downward for existing blocks (but in examples, below is empty), and places by max height per relative column— but arbitrary width (base_min_c to min(base_max_c, base_min_c+6)) limits stacking incorrectly.
 * In examples, stacked objects are often shifted left or centered under base, not rigidly at block_min.
 * Colors must be preserved; no recoloring.
 * If no components, return unchanged (correct edge case).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely.
 * Correctly identifies components and base (largest by size), and attempts hole-fitting and below-stacking logic, showing partial understanding of rearrangement.
 * get_holes is broken/not helpful: it collects all adjacent cells to base (including non-empty and external), without checking for actual empty holes, leading to invalid placements; do not use as-is—replace with flood-fill for internal empties or perimeter empties only.
 * Hole placement loop checks bounds and overlaps correctly (good), but since holes are wrong, no placements succeed, pushing everything to stacking.
 * Stacking sorts by color (may be wrong—expected seems by position or size), uses arbitrary width limit (6 cols, ignores full base width), and skyline init/scanning assumes blocks below base (but examples are empty), resulting in misaligned drops.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps most blocks in original positions (e.g., 8's large base intact but with intrusions like misplaced 6's and 3's), adds junk like isolated 4's/2's/1's low; expected rearranges small objects into base gaps (e.g., 1's and 2's fill top of 6's area, 3's/4's stack below in compact L-shapes) and clears originals—mismatch in all small object positions, base unchanged except minor overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated leaves 2's base mostly intact with intrusions (e.g., 1's/3's/4's embedded wrongly), empties some but doesn't stack below properly; expected drops 1's/3's/4's below base in a stacked tower (e.g., 3's on bottom, 4's/1's above, shifted left)—mismatch in embedding (overlaps base) and no below stacking, originals not cleared.
 * get_anchor and component extraction are essential and correct—keep them.
 * Overall, demonstrates core idea of base + fit/stack but misses hole detection, placement validation, stacking alignment/width, and clearing logic subtlety (only clears if placed, but fails to place).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be mostly unchanged from what seems like the input (based on patterns: large 3's vertical/horizontal spans, 1's/4's/8's/6's/2's in clusters), with no evident rearrangement—small objects like 1's, 2's, 6's are still in upper/mid positions, not fitted into the apparent base (likely the large 3's or 8's) or stacked below.
 * It does not look correct: Expected should show small components (e.g., the compact 1's, 2's, 6's groups) either embedded in gaps of the base (e.g., filling voids in 3's or 8's structures) or dropped below in a skyline-stable stack under the base's columns, with originals cleared to 0; here, everything remains in place with possible minor shifts (e.g., 2's still low-right), suggesting failed fitting/stacking like in training.
 * Missing: Cleared originals, no stacking below (bottom rows still sparse), potential overlaps if any movement occurred (hard to tell without input, but pattern unchanged); does not compact or reorganize as in expected training outputs.
 * To handle test: Ensure full base width for stacking (not arbitrary 6), proper empty hole detection (e.g., only 0-cells adjacent/internal), sort smalls by size descending for stable stacking, and verify placements update out grid fully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual reassembly puzzle where the input grid contains disconnected colored regions (connected components of the same number/color), and the goal is to identify the largest component as a fixed "base" image, then translate (shift by dr/dc) the smaller components to adjacent or filling positions relative to the base to reconstruct a coherent overall picture without overlaps, ensuring connectivity and proper alignment. The output should match an expected reconstructed grid, likely forming a specific shape or scene from the pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the exact same color value (number >0); diagonals do not count as connected.
 * The largest component (by cell count) is treated as the immovable base; if multiple largest, select the one with the smallest color value as base.
 * Smaller components must be rigidly translated (no rotation, scaling, or deformation) to new positions that do not overlap existing placed cells (out[r][c] must be 0) and stay within 30x30 bounds.
 * Placement must ensure adjacency: at least one cell of the small component must touch (4-way) an already placed cell (from base or prior smalls), or the placement is invalid.
 * Optimization for placement: Prefer positions that "fill" the base's bounding box (cells inside base_min_r to base_max_r and base_min_c to base_max_c score higher), maximize adjacent touches (adj_count), and tie-break by minimizing row/col positions (top-left preference via -min_nr, -min_nc).
 * If no valid placement found for a small component, it is omitted (left as 0s).
 * Subtlety: The base's bounding box is used for "filling" scoring, but placements can extend outside it; however, the score heavily favors internal filling to reconstruct dense shapes.
 * All-zero input or no components yields all-zero output.
 * Components must preserve their exact shape and color during translation.
 * Potential for multiple smalls of same color, but they are treated separately if disconnected.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of smalls by (-min_r, min_c) of their original positions may influence placement order, potentially affecting overlaps; exhaustive search over dr/dc (-29 to 29) is computationally heavy but necessary for exact fit.
 * No rotation or mirroring allowed; only pure translation.
 * The reconstructed image likely forms a specific puzzle picture (e.g., a character or object), so placements should visually cohere beyond just scoring.

The `program` function structure is partially helpful (component extraction and base selection), but the placement loop is flawed (see below); the scoring tuple (fill_count, adj_count, -min_nr, -min_nc) is a good idea but needs refinement for better fits.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly extracts connected components using 4-way adjacency and identifies the base as the largest (with min color tie-break), which works for placing the immovable parts in both training examples (e.g., 8's in train1 and 2's in train2 are positioned correctly relative to their original spots).
 * Base bounding box calculation is accurate and used for fill scoring, which is a key insight for reconstruction.
 * Sorting smalls by (-min_r, min_c) attempts to process "top-left first," which may help order but doesn't guarantee correct assembly order.
 * Placement validation correctly checks bounds and no-overlap (out[nr][nc] == 0), and requires at least one adjacency (has_adj), preventing isolated placements.
 * However, the exhaustive dr/dc search (-29 to 29) is too broad and inefficient, leading to suboptimal or wrong placements; it often finds local maxima that don't reconstruct the expected image (e.g., smalls placed far away or inside base without proper shape matching).
 * In train1, generated output places 1's and 2's on the left of base 8's (rows 10-13), 4's partially overlapping/near base, 3's and 6's below (rows 19-21), but expected has 6's above 1's/2's on top of base (rows 9-13 for top pieces), and 3's/4's in a stacked formation below (rows 19-26 with specific 4-3 interleaving); difference: wrong vertical/horizontal shifts, no filling of base extensions upward, and 6's omitted entirely (likely no valid adj placement found under current scoring).
 * In train1, top 10 rows are all 0s in generated (vs. expected with 6's/1's starting row9), showing failure to extend base upward.
 * In train2, generated places 1's/3's/4's scattered near base 2's (e.g., 1's in row12 col18-20, 3's in row15-17 col9-12, 4's in row18 col9-12), but expected has 1's higher in row12 col10-13, 3's in row16-18 col9-12 shifted down/right, and 4's in row18-20 col9-12; difference: smalls not shifted to fill gaps properly (e.g., 1's not aligned left, 3's/4's vertically stacked wrong), and some 0s where expected has pieces (e.g., row14 col23-24).
 * Both trains fail to achieve exact match, with generated having misplaced smalls (wrong dr/dc chosen) and occasional omissions (e.g., train1 6's missing, possibly due to no adj position scoring high enough).
 * Scoring prioritizes fill_count too heavily, but in expects, some placements extend outside base bbox (e.g., train1 4's/3's below base); adj_count is underweighted, leading to loose connections.
 * No rotation or advanced fitting (e.g., shape matching beyond translation) attempted, which is correct but insufficient for puzzle coherence.
 * The all-zero fallback for empty input is correct but unused here.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to treat a large 3-component as base (flooding much of the grid with 3's in rows 4-29, cols 9-15+), then scatter smaller pieces like 6's (rows 0-3 col7-8), 4's (rows 0-3 col16-19), 2's (rows 11-14 col16-17), 1's (rows 17-19 col16-18), and 8's (rows 17-20 col5-8), creating a messy, non-coherent spread rather than a unified picture.
 * Issues: Over-reliance on 3's as base leads to overwriting potential spaces; smalls are placed with minimal connection (e.g., 2's touch 3's edge but don't fill gaps), and no upward/downward extensions like in train expects; many 0s remain where pieces should connect (e.g., rows 4-10 have isolated 3's without adjacent smalls integrating); visually, it looks like fragmented blobs rather than reassembled (e.g., 8's and 1's near bottom don't align with top 6's/4's).
 * Likely wrong because test input (inferred from placements) has multiple large 3-regions that get merged incorrectly; expects probably require precise shifts to form vertical/horizontal stacks similar to trains (e.g., smalls filling "arms" or "legs" of a figure), but scoring picks suboptimal top-left-ish positions without true image reconstruction.
 * To handle test: Need better scoring (e.g., penalize extensions outside bbox less, reward multi-adjacency or shape complementarity); possibly process smalls in color order or size-descending for better layering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors), where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color, 4-connected) and rearrange them into a new grid. The largest blob (by pixel count) serves as a "base" structure, and smaller blobs are attached or packed around it in a way that forms a cohesive or interlocking assembly, often integrating them into or adjacent to the base without overlaps, following rules based on blob dimensions, original positions, or size ordering to match expected layouts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and same-color pixels only; disconnected same-color pixels form separate components.
 * The base is always the largest blob by pixel count; if ties, the code picks one, but expected outputs suggest it might need to be the one with the most central or specific positional traits.
 * Placement is conditional on base orientation: if taller than wide (vertical), attach stacks to the left, starting from the top; if wider than tall (horizontal), attach below, starting from the left. However, this leads to separate stacking without integration, while expecteds show interlocking (e.g., small blobs nested within or protruding from base gaps).
 * Grouping small blobs by bounding box width (max_c - min_c + 1) is used, then sorting within groups by min_r ascending and min_c descending (to preserve some original vertical-then-right-to-left order), and processing widths descending (largest first). This works for ordering but fails in placement, as expecteds integrate blobs rather than stacking rigidly.
 * Avoid overlaps: Code checks if output[gr][gc] == 0 before placing, which is good, but expecteds have no overlaps and precise fitting (e.g., blobs fill gaps in base or align to form larger shapes).
 * Handle empty grids: Returns all-zero grid if no components, which matches expecteds' top rows of zeros.
 * Subtle: Original positions influence sorting/placement order (e.g., higher min_r first), suggesting preservation of "reading order" (top-to-bottom, right-to-left within rows?). Blobs may need rotation or flipping? No evidence, but rigid translation fails.
 * Bounds checking: Ensure placements stay within 0-29; code does this, but in vertical mode, stacking from b_min_r can overflow if base is low; in horizontal, from b_max_r +1 can push beyond.
 * Integration vs. separation: Generated outputs keep blobs separate (no merging), but expecteds merge them into a single connected structure (e.g., small blobs fill base voids or extend it). Pixel count preservation: All pixels from input must appear in output, unchanged colors.
 * Edge cases: Blobs with holes or irregular shapes (e.g., L/T/etc.) need relative positioning preserved during translation. Small blobs (1-5 pixels) attach differently than large ones. All-zero areas in input are ignored.
 * Potential missed rule: Placement might follow original relative positions (e.g., blobs originally left of base go left in output), or by color order, or to minimize bounding box. Expecteds often have small blobs in a "sidebar" column (e.g., cols 4-8 in train1) stacked vertically, then base, then another group below/right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `get_components` function is solid: it correctly detects 4-connected blobs, computes bounding boxes (bbox as (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)), pixel counts, and positions. It uses a stack for DFS traversal and visited array, handling all blobs efficiently. This is essential for extraction and should be reused.

    return components
```

No other functions from the attempt are notably helpful; the placement logic (vertical/horizontal stacking) is flawed and should be reworked, not reused directly. The grouping/sorting code is partially useful for ordering but needs integration tweaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it fails both training examples completely (marked INCORRECT), indicating core placement rules are misunderstood.
 * Component extraction works: Base (largest blob, e.g., 8's in train1) is placed correctly in its original relative shape, but small blobs are translated rigidly without fitting into base gaps.
 * Grouping by width and sorting (min_r asc, min_c desc) captures some ordering (e.g., processes top-to-bottom, right-to-left), but application fails: In train1 generated, small blobs (6,4,1,2,3) are scattered below base in rows 19-31 with overlaps/gaps (e.g., 6's in row20 cols1-5, but expected has them stacked neatly in cols4-8 rows9-13 integrated with base); 8's have holes unfilled (e.g., row14 col5-7 empty in generated, but expected fills with 2's). In train2 generated, base 2's are correct in rows8-13, but small 1,3,4 placed below in rows14-23 scattered/misaligned (e.g., 1's in row15 cols10-13 but expected integrates them into base at row13 col11); 3's and 4's detached vs. expected nested.
 * Vertical/horizontal detection works (train1 base is horizontal-ish, places below; train2 vertical, but code has bug in vertical: stacks left but from b_min_r, causing misalignment). Rigid stacking ignores integration: Generated keeps blobs separate, expecteds interlock (e.g., train1 expected has 2's protruding into 8's bbox, 3/4 below as extension).
 * Overflow handling is present but ineffective: Train1 generated has blobs in rows19-31 but wrong positions (e.g., 4's in row19 col6, but expected in row21 col17); some pixels missing or shifted (unknown why, possibly bbox calc error in relative placement).
 * Train1 mismatches: Small blobs not stacked vertically in sidebar (cols4-8); 3/4 group below base in cols16-19 rows19-31 as vertical stack, but generated scatters 3's absent. Train2 mismatches: Small blobs should nest into base (e.g., 1's inside 2's at row13), but generated places separately below; 3/4 in rows16-20 detached vs. expected integrated right.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the entire placement block (if is_vertical else) is broken: It assumes non-integrated stacking, which doesn't match expecteds' merged structures. Don't reuse as-is; focus on gap-filling or attachment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed stacking logic that failed trainings: Small blobs (8's top, then 4's/6's/2's/1's in cols3-8 rows0-20, stacked vertically but rigidly translated) are placed left of a long vertical 3's stack in cols9-16 rows0-29, with no integration (e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols3-7 detached, 6's in rows8-11 cols3-6 separate). This creates a sidebar of small shapes + tall 3's extension, but expecteds from trainings suggest interlocking (e.g., small blobs should fill gaps in base, like 2's into 8's, or nest 1's into larger). No base identified/placed centrally; 3's seem overextended (full height, possibly the "base" but misplaced). It preserves shapes but fails cohesion—looks like separate columns vs. unified structure. Missing: Original relative ordering/integration; likely wrong base (if 3's are largest, should be central with others attached). To handle test, need to detect base gaps and fit small blobs by bbox overlap or adjacency rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color) and rearrange them into a new grid by selecting the largest component as a base and attaching smaller components adjacent to it (touching via edges) or stacking them above/below to form a coherent, possibly stacked or assembled structure, while preserving the relative shapes of each component. The output must match an expected reconfiguration that connects components logically without overlaps, often repositioning them to build upward or fill spaces near the base.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (only orthogonal neighbors: up, down, left, right; no diagonals), so blobs must be extracted using flood-fill or stack-based traversal to group same-color pixels correctly.
 * The largest component (by pixel count, with color as tiebreaker) is always placed as the "base" in its original position, serving as an anchor for attaching others; smaller components must be translated (shifted rigidly, preserving shape) to touch the base or existing structure via at least one edge pixel, but cannot overlap or go out of bounds.
 * Placement prioritizes proximity to the base (searching in a bounded window around the base's bounding box, e.g., ±5 cells), requiring adjacency check after fitting; if no adjacent spot fits, try placing above the base (scanning rows from top to base's min row); fallback to original positions only if nothing works, but this often fails as the puzzle expects full reassembly.
 * Sorting smaller components by descending size (then color) ensures larger attachments go first, but this can block smaller ones if not careful; subtle issue: adjacency must be to any existing placed pixel (not just base), so update the "out" grid iteratively.
 * Anchor point for placement is the top-left (min row, then min col in that row) of each component, used for relative shifting (dr, dc); this works for top-aligned fitting but may miss rotations or flips (puzzle likely forbids them, as shapes must stay intact).
 * Grids have lots of empty space (0s), and components don't wrap around edges; expected outputs often "stack" vertically (e.g., smaller blobs on top of base like a tower) or fill gaps, but horizontal spreading is possible if adjacent.
 * Easy to miss: Overly restrictive search windows (e.g., only ±5 around base) prevent valid placements far away; adjacency check must scan all 4 directions from every pixel in the proposed position, not just the anchor.
 * Fallback to original positions pollutes the output with scattered blobs, which mismatches expectations where everything connects into one structure.
 * Colors must stay the same; no recoloring or merging different colors.
 * In expectations, disconnected original components get connected in output, suggesting the puzzle is about reassembly like a jigsaw or block-stacking game.

(This flood-fill function correctly extracts 4-connected components as (color, list of (r,c) positions); essential for identifying blobs.)

    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```
(This computes the top-left anchor for rigid shifting; helpful for placement but assumes top-aligned fitting, which may need expansion for other alignments.)

```python
def try_place(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    ar, ac = get_anchor(pos)
    min_r_b = min(r for r, c in base_pos)
    max_r_b = max(r for r, c in base_pos)

                nr = r + dr
                nc = c + dc
                if not (0 <= nr < 30 and 0 <= nc < 30) or out[nr][nc] != 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                adjacent = False

                for r, c in pos:
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nnr = nr + dx

                            break
                    if adjacent:
                        break
                if adjacent:
                    for r, c in pos:
                        out[r + dr][c + dc] = color
                    return True
    return False
```
(This attempts bounded placement near base with overlap/adjacency checks; core logic but flawed by small search window (±5/6) and base-only adjacency reference—should check against all placed pixels.)

```python
def try_place_above(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    # Similar to try_place but scans only above base (tr < min_r_b, full columns)
    # ... (code as provided)
```
(This is a variant for vertical stacking; helpful but too restrictive (full columns only, no bounded tc), and still fails if shape doesn't fit exactly above.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts all connected components using flood-fill, places the largest (base) component unchanged in its original position, and sorts smaller ones by size descending for placement order.
 * Base selection works (e.g., 8's in train1, 2's in train2), and initial out grid setup is correct.
 * Adjacency detection logic is sound (checks 4 directions from shifted positions against existing out pixels) and prevents overlaps/out-of-bounds.
 * Anchor-based shifting preserves component shapes rigidly, which matches puzzle needs (no rotation/flipping).
 * Fallback to original positions ensures no loss of components but leads to scattered outputs, which is unhelpful as expectations require connected reassembly.
 * In train1, generated output places base 8's correctly (rows 14-18 match expected 8's positions/shapes) but leaves smaller components (e.g., 6's in row9-10 cols4-8, 1's/3's/4's/2's in rows9-13) in original scattered positions instead of reassembling: expected moves 6's to row9 cols4-8 (but shifted left?), interleaves 1's/2's under 8's (rows14-15 cols5-8 for 2's), adds 3's/4's at bottom (rows19-29, connected downward); generated has no bottom attachments and upper blobs unmoved, so disconnected and incomplete stacking.
 * In train2, generated places base 2's correctly (rows8-13 full width, with some holes filled wrong) but scatters 1's/3's/4's in original top positions (rows3-7, e.g., 3's in row5-6 cols0-3); expected keeps 2's base but moves 1's to row13 col10-11 (under 2's), 3's below that (row15-17 cols9-12), 4's at bottom (row18-20); generated fails to attach downward, leaving top empty and no vertical build.
 * try_place and try_place_above are partially helpful but broken by tiny search radius (±5 around base), causing most placements to fallback to originals; adjacency only triggers if touching base_pos (not updating to all out), so later components don't attach to prior small ones.
 * Sorting by size is good but doesn't account for shape compatibility (e.g., wide blobs block narrow ones).
 * No rotation or multiple anchor tries, missing subtle fits (e.g., side-attachment in train1's 2's under 8's).
 * Overall, detects structure but fails reassembly: outputs are mostly original grid subsets, not transformed/connected as expected.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have placed the base (likely 3's, large vertical/horizontal span in cols9-15 rows7-29) in original positions but scattered others awkwardly: e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols4-7 (shifted up-left?), 6's/1's mixed in rows4-7 cols4-7, 4's/2's in rows0-3 cols16-21, with many 3's in originals and gaps filled poorly; this creates a jumbled left-side cluster but no clear stacking or full connectivity—e.g., 4's touch 3's horizontally but 8's/6's are isolated above, and bottom 3's trail off without attachments.
 * Unlike expectations (which connect everything into a single vertical/horizontal assembly, e.g., stacking small blobs atop/beside base), this is partially moved but overlaps or disconnects (e.g., row4 col8 has 1 next to 3, but shapes don't align rigidly); search window too small likely caused incomplete fits, leaving fallback positions dominant.
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too fragmented, no evident "tower" or filled structure; needs broader search and iterative adjacency to all placed (not just base) to handle test's complex shapes (long 3's column, scattered small 1/2/4/6/8).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid where numbered cells represent colored blobs (connected components of the same number/color via 4-directional adjacency). The goal is to reassemble these disjoint blobs into a single, compact, connected structure packed toward the top-left of the grid, by translating (not rotating or deforming) each blob and placing them to maximize overall connectivity while avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-way connected groups of the same number (color); diagonals do not count as connected.
 * Identify the largest blob (by cell count) as the "base" and translate it to the top-left (starting at row 0, col 0, aligned by its own top-left anchor) to anchor the structure.
 * For smaller blobs, translate them (using their top-left anchor) to positions that maximize the number of adjacent edges (4 directions) touching already-placed cells (any color), while ensuring no overlaps with existing cells and staying within grid bounds.
 * Among positions with equal adjacency score, prefer those that result in the lowest minimum row (pack upward), then lowest minimum column (pack leftward), then smallest vertical span (more compact height).
 * Sort smaller blobs for placement by descending size (largest first to build structure), then by ascending color if sizes tie.
 * The output must form one fully connected structure (no disjoint blobs); isolated placements or failure to attach create gaps.
 * Subtlety: Original positions in input are irrelevant—everything must be relocated relative to the top-left-packed base; keeping original positions causes distant placements.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency scoring counts touching edges to any placed color (not just same color), but only after validating no overlap/out-of-bounds.
 * Subtlety: Empty input rows/columns should remain mostly empty except for the packed structure; outputs show packing starting around row 9-14 in examples, not row 0.
 * Consideration: Brute-force all possible translations (30x30 positions per blob), but optimize by checking validity early to avoid computation issues.
 * Consideration: If no valid position (e.g., due to size), the blob might not place, but examples show all blobs always placeable by attaching.
 * All blobs must preserve internal shape and relative positions—no rotation, flipping, or splitting.

    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Connected component detection worked correctly in both training examples, accurately grouping same-color adjacent cells.
 * Anchor calculation is correct and helpful for translation.
 * Base selection by max size is correct, but placement failed: base kept in original scattered positions instead of translating to top-left (row 0, col 0 aligned), causing the entire structure to start mid-grid (e.g., 8's at row 14 in train1) and small blobs to place far away.
 * Placement of small blobs prioritized top-left empty spots (score 0) over attaching to base due to flawed tie-breaking and no initial base shift, leading to disjoint groups: in train1, 6/1/4/3/2 groups placed in rows 5-12 (upper-left isolated), not touching 8's base; 3's/4's misplaced in upper area instead of attaching below 8's in rows 20-25 as expected.
 * In train1 generated vs. expected: Upper empty rows 0-4 match, but generated places 6's/1's at rows 5-7 (too high, no touch to 8's), adds erroneous 4's/3's at rows 8-12 (overlapping/misplaced, expected empty), 2's at rows 12-13 partially touch 8's but overall disjoint; expected shifts 6/1/2 group to rows 9-13 touching 8's at col 4-8, adds 4's interwoven with 3's at rows 20-25 touching 8's at col 16-20—generated has no such lower attachment and wrong shapes (e.g., 4's not below 3's).
 * In train2 generated vs. expected: Base 2's correctly identified but kept original (rows 8-13 wide), small placements isolated: 3's/1's/4's scattered in rows 13-19 with overlaps/gaps (e.g., 3's at col 10-13 row 14-17 fragmented), 4's misplaced at col 22-25 row 13-14; expected packs 1's at row 13 col 10-13 touching 2's, 3's/4's below at rows 15-19 interwoven/touching (e.g., 4's frame 3's)—generated has disjoint 4's and unknown shape mismatches in 1/3 areas.
 * Sorting small blobs by (-size, color) is reasonable but ineffective without base shift.
 * Brute-force position search is conceptually good but computationally naive (30x30=900 checks per blob, up to ~10 blobs ok), but validity check works; scoring counts adjacencies correctly but fails to prefer base proximity without shift.
 * No rotation/deformation attempted, which is correct (preserves shapes).
 * Overall, attempts show partial understanding (blob extraction solid), but core failure in relocating base to top-left causes all placements to cascade wrong, resulting in 0/2 training passes; no unhelpful functions, but original-position base placement is broken for this puzzle.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places a mixed 2/4/8/3 group in upper rows 0-4 (left cols 0-16), then 1's/6's in rows 14-20 (partially touching 3's but disjoint from upper), followed by long vertical 3's stacks in rows 6-29 (cols 9-15, separate from main group). This creates multiple disjoint structures (upper mixed, mid 1/6, lower 3's), not one connected whole packed top-left. Expected likely packs all (2/3/4/6/8/1) into a single interwoven blob starting ~row 0-5 left-aligned, with 3's integrated (not isolated verticals), 6's/1's attached to 8's/4's, and no gaps—generated has overlaps (e.g., 3's intrude on 8's at row 3 col 9-16?) and unknown shape distortions (e.g., 3's too fragmented vertically). Fails attachment rule, as lower 3's don't touch upper meaningfully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (polyominoes) of the same color, preserve the largest central component unchanged, clear or ignore smaller ones initially, and then rearrange the smaller components (size >=2 and typically < half the large one's size) into ordered stacks or attachments on the left and/or right sides of the large component, positioned relative to its vertical center with specific horizontal and vertical offsets based on color, size, or original position, while preserving their shapes and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The large component is the biggest connected group by cell count (not by color priority), and it must remain in its exact original position and shape; everything else is cleared before placing smalls.
 * Small components are only those with 2+ cells, connected by 4-directional adjacency (up/down/left/right), same color, and size < large_size // 2; single cells or tiny groups (<2) are ignored entirely.
 * Grouping smalls by approximate horizontal position: left side (avg column <15) vs. right side (avg column >=15), assuming a 30-column grid.
 * Within each group, sort by color ascending, then by vertical center (row average) ascending for stacking order.
 * Stacking: Place stacks vertically offset from the large component's vertical center (e.g., large_center_y ± (6 + order * 4)), at fixed x-centers (e.g., 6 for left, 17.5 for right); preserve shape via translation (shift by delta row/col, round to integers), but this can cause distortions if shapes don't align perfectly or if rounding clips cells.
 * Placement must check grid bounds and overwrite only zeros (no merging or overlapping with existing pixels); if translation causes out-of-bounds or overlaps, it may silently clip or fail.
 * Subtle: Vertical offset calculation uses comp_height incorrectly in the code (comp_center_r - min_row, but this isn't used properly); stacks should mimic "attachment" or "piling" without rotating or reshaping, but order might prioritize color over y-position in some cases.
 * Grid is 30 columns wide, variable rows (e.g., 30x30?); empty rows at top/bottom in outputs suggest vertical centering or trimming isn't needed.
 * Colors are treated distinctly but sorting is by color value (1<2<...<8); no rotation or mirroring of shapes.
 * Potential misses: Some smalls might attach directly to large (e.g., integrated in expected), not just stacked separately; offsets like 4.0 units per stack item ensure spacing; right-side stacks may shift further (e.g., +17.5 col center).
 * All attempts clear non-large pixels first, which works for isolation but fails if expected integrates smalls into/around large without full clearing.
 * Connected components must ignore different colors (only same-color adjacency).

 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly detects all connected components and identifies the large one (e.g., the 8's in train1, 2's in train2), preserving it unchanged.
 * Clearing non-large pixels works to isolate the large component but fails because expected outputs rearrange smalls without fully clearing—smalls are placed in new positions but sometimes integrated or attached directly to the large one (e.g., 1's and 2's embedded in/around 8's in train1 expected).
 * Grouping by x-position (<15 left, else right) is partially helpful but too rigid— in train1 generated, all smalls (2's,4's,1's,3's) end up in awkward left/right stacks, but expected has 1's/2's on left integrated vertically with large, and 3's/4's stacked below as separate groups.
 * Sorting by color then y-center works for ordering but offset calculation is broken: get_target_center_y uses incorrect comp_height (comp_center_r - min(p[0])), leading to misaligned vertical positions (e.g., in train1 generated, 2's and 4's stacks are too high/low relative to 8's center ~row 16-17).
 * Translation and placement preserve shapes but rounding causes slight shifts/distortions (e.g., in train1 generated, 4's L-shape becomes misaligned at rows 4-8 left, not matching expected integrated positions); no overlap handling with large, causing potential overwrites.
 * In train1 generated: Large 8's correct, but smalls placed as separate stacks (4's left high, 2's left mid, 1's/3's bottom scattered) vs. expected (1's/2's woven into large at rows 10-14 left, 3's/4's as tight stacks bottom rows 20-29 rightish, with some 6's? wait, expected has 6's/1's/2's mixed left mid).
 * In train2 generated: Large 2's correct at rows 8-13, but smalls (4's top,1's mid-left,3's bottom) placed scattered vs. expected (1's/3's/4's stacked right bottom rows 14-20, integrated with 2's extensions at row 13 cols 10-13/21-22).
 * find_small_polyominoes filters correctly (< large//2, >=2) but misses that some smalls might be same-color as large or need different size thresholds.
 * clear_non_large_pixels is helpful for isolation but over-applies—expected keeps smalls' info for rearrangement without clearing until placement.
 * group_by_x_position and sort_by_color are directionally useful but hardcoded thresholds (15 col, 6/17.5 x-centers) fail for varying grid positions (e.g., train2 smalls all leftish but expected right-stacked).
 * get_stack_center_x and get_target_center_y have right idea (left/right, offset stacking) but offsets (6+order*4) too large/spaced, causing gaps/misalignments (e.g., train1 generated has huge empty spaces above/below stacks).
 * place_component is basic but lacks overlap avoidance with large or other smalls, leading to silent failures (e.g., if translated pos hits large, it overwrites to small color).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction and basic rearrangement but botches positioning/offsets, leading to all INCORRECT; no rotation/merging considered, which might be needed for integration.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it keeps a large block of 3's (rows 0-29 cols 9-15, size ~200+ cells) as central, which seems right, but places smalls (6's as scattered tetrominoes rows 2-7 left, 4's as polyomino rows 7-10 left/mid) overlapping or adjacent to large without proper stacking, then dumps 1's (row 20 right), 2's (rows 23-26 right), 8's (rows 27-29 right) as horizontal stacks below/right, creating a cluttered bottom without vertical alignment to large's center (~row 14-15).
 * Differences: Expected likely has smalls (1,2,4,6,8) stacked neatly left/right of large 3's center, ordered by color (1 then 2 left, 4/6/8 right?), with 4-unit vertical spacing, no overlaps, and shapes preserved (e.g., 6's I-shape vertical left, 4's S-shape attached mid-right); generated has misaligned x-centers (all smalls hugging left of large), incorrect y-offsets (bottom dumps too low, no centering), and possible clipping (8's at row 29 may bound out). This doesn't match puzzle rules as stacks aren't symmetrically attached/ordered relative to large.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 30x30 grid involving colored connected components (blobs of the same number/color), where the goal is to identify the largest "large" component, rearrange the smaller "small" components (size <20, excluding large size) by stacking them adjacent to the large one (vertically below if large is horizontal, horizontally to the right if vertical), sorted by color, while removing the original small components from the grid, and potentially integrating some smalls into or overwriting parts of the large component to form a new arrangement that matches a target scene or pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) of the same color/value; diagonals do not count.
 * The "large" component is the one with maximum size (number of cells); if ties, max() picks the first or arbitrary, but in examples, it's clear.
 * Small components are filtered as size <20 and size != large_size; this excludes the large and any medium/large duplicates, but may miss if there are multiples of large size.
 * Orientation check: Large is "horizontal" if (max_col - min_col +1) > (max_row - min_row +1); else vertical. This determines stacking direction (vertical stack below for horizontal large, horizontal stack right for vertical large).
 * Stacking: Small components are sorted by color ascending. For vertical stack (below horizontal large), align to large's min_col, start at large max_row +1, place each small shifted (dy to current_row, dx to align min_col), but constrain to a "common_width" (max width of smalls) and check bounds; increment current_row by small's height. For horizontal stack (right of vertical large), align to a fixed center_row ~13-15 with common_height=4, start at large max_col +1, shift dx to current_col, dy to align, constrain to common_height rows, increment current_col by small's width.
 * Removal: After placement, set original small positions to 0; this must happen after all placements to avoid overwriting new spots, but code does it last.
 * Subtleties: In expected outputs, some small components appear "integrated" or overwriting parts of the large (e.g., in train 1, 1/2/6 shapes cut into/near 8's in rows 9-13 and 14-15; in train 2, 1 integrated into 2's in row 13-14). Stacking is not always simple alignment—e.g., in train 1 expected, 3/4 stack in columns 16-19 starting row 19, interwoven shapes (not just shifted copies), right-aligned to large. In train 2, 3/4 stack vertically in columns 9-12 rows 15-20, but with specific offsets. Common dimensions (width/height) are assumed but not always max—may need per-component fitting or fixed sizes (e.g., height=4). Placement may overlap or modify large (not just adjacent). Originals must be fully removed, but generated often leaves them (e.g., bottom rows in train 1). Grid bounds (0-29) must be respected; out-of-bounds ignored. Colors are integers 1-8 typically. Multiple smalls of same color? Code treats as separate if disconnected. Queue in find_components appends without check, leading to inefficient/infinite if not bounded, but visited prevents. Flat_positions iterates all, good for full scan.
 * Easy to miss: Integration/overwriting large (not just stacking adjacent); exact alignment may be to large's right edge or center, not min_col; stacking may interleave shapes (e.g., train 1 row20: 4 3 3 4); common_height/width hardcoded or max may not fit expected (train 2 uses ~4 height but specific positions); removal must target only smalls, not large; if no smalls, return copy unchanged.
 * All considerations: Bugs in shifting (e.g., dy/current_row wrong, leading to top placement instead of below); constraint checks (new_col < common_min_col + width) may clip shapes; sorting by color works but expected may reverse or group same color; horizontal stack centers at row 13 but expected may differ (train 2 stacks lower); vertical large not tested well (train 1 large is horizontal, train 2 is horizontal too? Wait, train 2 large 2's rows 8-12 cols 0-29, width=30>height=5, horizontal).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component finding and basic extraction are helpful but buggy in queue/visited. Placement and removal need fixes. Types like Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int,int]]] for (color, size, min_col, max_col, min_row, max_row, positions) are useful for bounding box + pos list.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    n = 30
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    flat_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    for pos in flat_positions:
        i, j = pos
        if g[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
            color = g[i][j]
            size = 0
            positions = []
            queue = deque([(i, j)])
            visited[i][j] = True
            while queue:
                x, y = queue.popleft()
                if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] == color and not visited[x][y]:
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    size += 1
                    positions.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        queue.append((nx, ny))  # Note: appends even out-of-bounds, but if-check skips; inefficient but works with visited.
            if size > 0:
                min_row = min(p[0] for p in positions)
                max_row = max(p[0] for p in positions)
                min_col = min(p[1] for p in positions)
                max_col = max(p[1] for p in positions)
                components.append((color, size, min_col, max_col, min_row, max_row, positions))  # Typo in code: 7th is missing, but append has 6 + positions=7 items? Wait, tuple has 7 + list.
    return components
```

```python
def get_large(components: List[Tuple]) -> Tuple:
    return max(components, key=lambda c: c[1])

def get_small(components: List[Tuple], large: Tuple) -> List[Tuple]:
    large_size = large[1]
    return [c for c in components if c[1] < 20 and c[1] != large_size]
```

```python
def is_horizontal(large: Tuple) -> bool:
    _, _, min_col, max_col, min_row, max_row = large[:6]
    dx = max_col - min_col + 1
    dy = max_row - min_row + 1
    return dx > dy
```

```python
def sort_small_by_color(small: List[Tuple]) -> List[Tuple]:
    return sorted(small, key=lambda c: c[0])
```

```python
def remove_original_small(h: List[List[int]], small: List[Tuple]):
    n = 30
    for c in small:
        _, _, _, _, _, _, c_pos = c
        for row, col in c_pos:
            if 0 <= row < n and 0 <= col < n:
                h[row][col] = 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction and basic stacking logic but fails on placement position, removal, and integration.
 * Component finding works for identifying blobs/sizes/bounds/positions, but queue appends unbounded neighbors (inefficient, but visited bounds it); helpful for extraction.
 * get_large and get_small are correct for selecting large and filtering smalls (<20, != large_size), matching examples (e.g., train 1 large=8 size~100+, smalls 3/4 size~10-15; train 2 large=2 size~120, smalls 1/3/4 <20).
 * is_horizontal correctly detects orientation (train 1/2 both horizontal, so vertical stack attempted).
 * sort_small_by_color works (e.g., train 1 sorts 3 then 4; train 2 sorts 1,3,4).
 * Placement functions (place_vertical_stack, place_horizontal_stack) have logic for shifting positions (dx/dy based on alignment) and bounds check, but buggy: in vertical_stack, current_row starts at large max_row+1 but generated places at top (rows 2-6 vs expected 19+); dx aligns to large min_col but clips to common_width, leading to partial/misplaced shapes (train 1: 4/3 in cols 7-11 rows 2-6, incomplete). Horizontal_stack assumes common_height=4 and center_row=13, but untested (both trains horizontal large); may clip vertically.
 * remove_original_small is correct in intent (set small pos to 0) but fails in generated (e.g., train 1 leaves 1/2/3/6 at bottom rows 22-29 and row 8; train 2 leaves 1 at top rows 1-4, 3/4 at bottom); possibly because components list includes non-smalls or placement overwrites incompletely, or bug in pos list.
 * No integration handled: Expected overwrites large with some smalls (train 1: 1/2/6 in rows 9-13 cols4-8, 2's in large rows14-15; train 2: 1 in large row13 cols10/12); code only stacks adjacent, no overwriting large.
 * compute_common_width uses max small width, helpful for alignment but too loose (expected stacks tighter, e.g., train 1 cols16-19 width=4 < max small width~5).
 * Overall, extraction tools essential and mostly correct; placement/removal broken; no handling for shape-specific offsets or interleaving in stack (e.g., train 1 row20: alternating 4/3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be mostly the original input grid with partial overwriting or misplaced smalls (e.g., 3's dominant in center cols9-15 rows0-29, like large 3; 8's shifted right cols18-22 rows3-6; 6's left bottom rows13-16 cols0-3; 2's row17 col21-23; 1's bottom right rows25-28 col22-23), but originals not removed (e.g., overlapping 3's everywhere, 4's scattered rows4-7 cols3-7). This suggests failed removal and incorrect shifting, similar to trains—stacking attempted but positions wrong (e.g., not cleanly below/right of large, no integration). Expected likely has clean stack of smalls (1,2,4,6,8? sorted 1,2,4,6,8) adjacent to large 3, with originals gone and possible overwriting (e.g., smalls cut into 3's or stacked tightly cols16+ rows large_end+1). Without exact expected, it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle—messy overlaps, no clear sorted stack, bounds violated implicitly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two train examples (the only complete input-output pairs provided), below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions or connections** between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **both** train examples (i.e., consistent across EVERY puzzle). I focused solely on patterns in positions, bounding boxes (bbox), pixel counts, holes, and colors that show clear cause-effect or relational changes (e.g., one element's position affecting another's repositioning) between input and output. 

- **Irrelevant or non-consistent elements excluded**: Orange and Purple elements are described but do not appear in either train, so no connections identified. Background (black void with implied grid) is static and does not interact dynamically (e.g., no color/position changes affecting it). Single isolated properties like raw shape names (e.g., L-shaped) are not used unless tied to a consistent interaction. No high-level puzzle solution or full rearrangement logic is inferred—only direct, observable links.
- **Unknowns called out**: Exact ordering within stacks (e.g., why Blue precedes Green in one case but not another) is unknown, as it varies without a clear consistent rule (e.g., not always by pixel count, color, or input y-position). Number of stacks (1 vs. 2) and their exact x-positions relative to the fixed element vary (e.g., left/right split in train 1 but centered in train 2), so no consistent rule for stack placement or count. No consistent color-to-color interactions (e.g., Green always affecting Yellow) due to varying element sets. No evidence of hole count affecting anything (all holes=0 unchanged). Shape-specific transformations (e.g., rotation causing bbox width/height swaps) cannot be explained consistently, as bbox changes are present but not rule-bound across cases.

#### 1. **Fixed Large Element → All Small Elements (Position Anchoring Interaction)**
   - **Components involved**: The single largest-pixel-count element with full horizontal span (bbox x from ~0 to ~29, pixels ~140-150, height ~4-5 units; color varies—Maroon in train 1, Red in train 2).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: This fixed element remains completely unchanged (same bbox, pixels, holes=0, color, position). It acts as a static anchor affecting **all small elements** (pixels 8-12, all other colors): small elements' positions are transformed (bbox x/y fully changed) to new locations where their y-ranges directly interface with the fixed element's y-range via adjacency or overlap (e.g., small stack starts/ends within 1-3 units of fixed y-start/end). No small element remains in its input position relative to the fixed one.
   - **Properties linked**: Fixed element's y-position → small elements' new y-position (causal: smalls "attach" via y-overlap/adjacency; e.g., train 1 fixed y14-18 overlaps left stack y9-15 and adjoins right stack y18-25; train 2 fixed y8-13 overlaps stack y12-19). Fixed element's x-span (full width) → small stacks' narrow x-width (3-4 units, non-spanning).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in both trains; no exceptions. Small elements preserve their own pixels/holes/color but lose input position independence due to this anchoring.

#### 2. **Small Elements → Small Elements (Stacking Alignment Interaction)**
   - **Components involved**: All small elements (pixels 8-12, colors: Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink, Red [when small]; holes=0).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Small elements interact with each other by being repositioned into 1+ vertical stacks (narrow x-range of 3-4 units, sequential y-ranges with minimal/no gaps or slight overlaps of 1-2 units). Each small element's individual bbox changes (x/y shifted), but they align y-sequentially within stacks, forming a chained vertical composition. This affects movement: input-scattered positions become output-aligned, with no small element isolated (all participate in at least one stack).
   - **Properties linked**: One small element's new y-end → next small element's y-start (causal: sequential stacking; e.g., train 1 left stack: Pink y9-10 → Blue y10-12 → Red y12-15; train 2 stack: Blue y12-15 → Green y15-18 → Yellow y17-19). Small elements' input positions → output stack narrowness (input varied x-widths ~3-8 units compress to consistent 3-4 unit x in stacks). Pixel count preserved per element but indirectly links to stack height (total stack y-span ~6-9 units across 3 elements).
   - **Consistency**: All small elements form stacks in both trains; stacking is vertical and grid-aligned in outputs (implied by integer bbox coords and polyomino pixels). No small element changes color/pixels/holes due to stacking.

#### 3. **Fixed Large Element + Small Elements → Overall Grid Alignment (Background-Implied Interaction)**
   - **Components involved**: Fixed large element, all small elements, and implied grid (from polyomino pixel alignment and bbox integers).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: The fixed element's horizontal span enforces grid alignment for small elements' output positions (smalls shift to grid-snapped bboxes). Smalls' stacking extends this, creating output compositions aligned to the fixed element's grid (no floating or misaligned elements).
   - **Properties linked**: Fixed element's bbox (x0-~29, y-mid) + smalls' pixels (polyomino totals) → output bbox integers (causal: all elements snap to implied grid; e.g., stack x-starts at 4/9/16, y-ends align to fixed y-boundaries).
   - **Consistency**: Outputs in both trains show grid-aligned rearrangements (scattered inputs become stacked/composed); no deviations.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no position → color changes, no hole/pixel effects on movement, no specific shape-edge/silhouette links across cases). These are the only obvious, direct connections observable in both trains. For the test input, the large element appears to be Green (pixels=192, tall y-span 0-29), which would likely anchor smalls (Yellow, Pink, Red, Blue, small Maroon) similarly, but exact stack details remain unknown without output.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 00:57:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid with colored blobs (connected components of integer values representing colors, e.g., 1-8), where the goal is to rearrange these blobs by rigidly translating them (shifting without rotation, scaling, or deformation) to new positions in an output grid. The rearrangement should form a coherent, non-overlapping image or picture, likely by filling gaps in a large "base" structure, attaching small blobs adjacently or within bounding boxes, and positioning others to complete shapes like letters, digits, or scenes, while preserving the original shape and color of each blob.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), so the connected components function must use orthogonal directions only—diagonal connections do not count as part of the same blob.
 * The largest blob (by cell count, tiebroken by highest color value) is typically the "base" or frame and should remain in its relative position or be placed centrally/unchanged, but smaller blobs must be translated to fill holes (empty 0 cells within the base's bounding box), attach to edges for adjacency, or extend outward to form additional structures without any overlaps or going out of bounds.
 * Placement must be rigid: entire blob shifts by the same (dr, dc), and no cell of the shifted blob can land on a non-zero cell in the output; however, placements can fill 0-cells inside the base's bounding box even if not directly adjacent initially.
 * Subtlety: The puzzle likely aims to reconstruct a specific "picture" (e.g., text like digits or letters formed by colors), so scoring for placement should prioritize not just filling the base bbox and adjacency but also global structure, such as sorting small blobs by color or min-row for sequential placement (e.g., top-to-bottom or left-to-right assembly), and avoiding scattering—blobs may need to form new connected groups across colors.
 * Overlaps are strictly forbidden, but the output can have intentional 0-holes in the final image; all input non-zero cells must be placed somewhere, or the output may be all zeros if no valid arrangement (but examples suggest full rearrangement).
 * Easy to miss: Base may have irregular shapes with internal 0s (holes), so placements can "infill" those; small blobs may need to be placed outside the base to form extensions (e.g., in train1 expected, 3s and 4s form a separate shape below); brute-force shifting (-30 to 30) is computationally heavy but necessary, but scoring must weight higher-level goals like minimizing overall bbox or maximizing total connections across all blobs.
 * Tiebreaking for base: Use size first, then max color, but if multiple large blobs, may need to choose the one that acts as a "frame" (e.g., surrounding others).
 * Sorting smalls: By increasing color, then min-row of original positions, but this may not capture puzzle order (e.g., place low colors on top).
 * Global considerations: Output should resemble a complete image (e.g., train1 expected forms what looks like a "6" or "E" on top with 1s/6s, a filled 8-base with 2s, and a "43"-like shape below with 3s/4s); scattered or partially overlapping placements fail; if no components, output all zeros.
 * Potential for multiple valid positions per blob—need backtracking or better scoring to find the exact configuration that matches the "intended" picture.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    visited = [[False] * 30 for _ in range(30)]
    components = []
    for i in range(30):
        for j in range(30):
            if g[i][j] > 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```
(This function correctly extracts 4-connected components by color, using DFS with stack; essential for identifying blobs to rearrange. Returns list of (color, list of (r,c) positions).)

The main program function uses this to find components, select base, and attempt placements, but the placement logic (brute-force shifts with scoring) is helpful as a starting point but needs refinement for scoring.

No other types or tools from the attempt; no unhelpful functions noted beyond the flawed scoring in the main logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and extracts connected components, keeping the base blob fixed and attempting to translate small blobs rigidly without overlap.
 * Base selection by max size (tie by color) worked for choosing the large 8 in train1, but placement of smalls failed to match expected infills and extensions (e.g., in train1, 1s/2s/6s should form top structures and fill 8-holes precisely, but generated scattered 1s/2s inside/over 8s wrongly and placed 4s at right edge disconnected).
 * What worked: Rigid translation and no-out-of-bounds checks prevented invalid placements; infill scoring (counting proposed cells inside base bbox) partially captured hole-filling, and adjacency count encouraged touching the base.
 * What didn't work: Scoring prioritized fill > adj > -min_r > -min_c, leading to top-left bias that ignored global picture formation (e.g., in train1 generated, 2s partially placed in row11-13 but misaligned with expected row14-15 infill; 1s overwrote or filled wrong 8-holes, creating mixed rows like row14 with 8s/1s/2s where expected has clean 8s+2s infill; 3s/4s/6s dumped at bottom/right disconnected, while expected integrates them into separate shapes below).
 * In train2, base 2s correctly placed as large block, but small 1s/3s/4s placed scattered (e.g., generated has 1s/3s in row13-17 left, 4s partial in row13, but expected stacks them compactly below/right without scattering, forming a vertical extension; unknown why generated placed 3s with holes and 4s fragmented).
 * Brute-force loop over dr/dc (-30 to 30) is correct but inefficient and fails due to poor score (e.g., many positions have equal fill/adj, falling to top-left which mismatches puzzle's structural needs like sequential color placement).
 * Sorting smalls by color then min_r is somewhat helpful for order but misses puzzle's likely top-to-bottom assembly.
 * get_connected_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but the placement scoring is flawed/not helpful as-is (leads to suboptimal positions; suggest weighting total image connectivity or matching expected shapes).
 * Both training examples incorrect: train1 generated has misplaced infills (e.g., 1s in row12-13 where expected has them higher in row9-12 as separate shape) and extra 0-holes in 8s; train2 generated fragments smalls (e.g., 4s in row13 col23-25 but expected consolidates them lower in row18-21).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it features a massive repeated block of 3s across columns 9-15 in rows 0-29 (like a thick vertical bar of 3s with minor intrusions), plus scattered 4s on left (rows 3-6), 8s on top-right (rows 2-5), 2s on bottom-right (rows 11-14), and 6s/1s at very bottom (rows 17-20), creating a disjoint, over-emphasized 3-structure that ignores rigid blob shapes.
 * This mismatches likely expected: Assuming similar to trains, the large 3-blob should be base (placed centrally), with small 4/8/2/6/1 blobs translated to fill its gaps (e.g., 4s/8s infilling holes for a solid frame) and extend outward (e.g., 2s/6s/1s forming attached shapes like digits on sides/top/bottom); instead, generated duplicates 3-like patterns (possibly multiple placements or bbox miscalc) and leaves most grid empty/disconnected, failing to form a coherent picture (e.g., no evident letter/digit assembly; 8s/2s isolated).
 * Subtleties missed: Test likely requires placing smalls to connect across colors (e.g., 6s+1s forming a top extension like in train1), but generated scatters them; the over-large 3-block suggests scoring bug where multiple shifts for same color succeed wrongly or base bbox is over-filled without overlap check enforcement.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties across **both** train puzzles. These are limited to patterns that hold true in every example without exception. I have excluded any high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., background color, which is uniform and unchanged), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., specific color groupings or input positions dictating exact output order, which vary and cannot be reliably connected). No shape transformations occur (e.g., no merging, splitting, or pixel/hole changes), so interactions are purely positional. Unknowns are noted where connections cannot be explained without forcing unsubstantiated links.

#### Consistent Components
- **Small shapes**: Defined by low pixel count (≤12 pixels), small bbox size (width/height ≤4 units), and unique color + pixel combinations (e.g., Green-8, Green-10, Yellow-12, Blue-9, Pink-8, Red-12). These are the "mobile" elements that interact via repositioning.
- **Large shape**: Defined by high pixel count (≥138 pixels) and wide bbox (width ≥29 units, spanning most of canvas x-range). Always one per puzzle (Maroon-138 in train 1; Red-151 in train 2). This is the "fixed" element that anchors interactions.

#### Consistent Interactions/Connections
- **Pixel count → positional stability**: 
  - High pixel count (large shape) → position unchanged (bbox identical in input and output).
  - Low pixel count (small shapes) → position transformed (bbox changes entirely; original positions irrelevant to final placement).
- **Large shape position → small shapes positioning (anchoring effect)**:
  - Small shapes' output positions are always constrained within or adjacent to the large shape's x-range (e.g., stacks at x=4-8 or 16-19 within large's x=0-29 in train 1; stack at x=9-12 within large's x=0-29 in train 2).
  - Small shapes' output y-positions are always adjacent or overlapping the large shape's y-range (e.g., one stack overlaps y=14-15 of large y=14-18 in train 1; stack overlaps y=12-13 of large y=8-13 in train 2). This creates a "placement relative to anchor" effect, but exact y-offset is unknown (varies slightly).
- **Small shape positions → vertical stacking alignment (group movement effect)**:
  - Multiple small shapes → new shared x-range in output (all in a stack align to same narrow x-width, e.g., width=3 or 4 units; no x-overlap between stacks).
  - Sequential y-placement within stacks: Adjacent y-ranges with no gaps or minimal overlap in bbox (e.g., y=9-10 then 10-12 then 12-15 in train 1 left stack; y=12-15 then 15-18 then 17-19 in train 2 stack). This implies an interaction where individual positions "connect" to form linear vertical chains.
  - Number of stacks varies (2 in train 1, 1 in train 2), but all small shapes participate in at least one stack → unknown grouping rule (e.g., no consistent color or pixel-based split).
- **Shape properties (color, pixels, holes) → preservation across transformation**:
  - Color + pixels → identity maintained (no mixing or alteration; e.g., all Greens keep their distinct pixel counts).
  - Holes (always 0) → no effect on any interaction (uniform and irrelevant).
- **Position → no direct color effect**:
  - Input positions do not consistently map to output colors or vice versa (e.g., no reliable "position → color" link; scattered inputs yield mixed-color stacks).

#### Unknowns (No Obvious Consistent Connection)
- Order of small shapes within stacks (e.g., why Pink-Blue-Red in train 1 vs. Blue-Green-Yellow in train 2; no consistent input property like y-position, x-position, or pixels explains it).
- How small shapes are assigned to specific stacks or x-positions (e.g., why two stacks in train 1 but one in train 2; no consistent property like color hue or shape type links them).
- Exact y-offset rules relative to large shape (e.g., some stacks start below, others on top; overlaps occur but pixel-level placement unknown).
- Any semantic shape interactions (e.g., "L-tromino" or "heart" forms mentioned in description; cannot confirm consistency without visual data, so no forced link).

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color, hole-to-position) are consistently observable across both trains. Irrelevant elements like the black background show no interaction. This analysis avoids any puzzle-solving implications.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 01:01:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids (though many rows are empty) where cells contain integers (0 for empty, 1-8 for colored or typed "objects" forming connected shapes or blobs), and the goal is to transform the input grid into a new output grid by identifying, extracting, and repositioning these objects according to specific rules—likely involving sorting by type/number, aligning them in a canonical order (e.g., top-to-bottom by number, left-justified), preserving shape but relocating them, and filling empty space with 0s, while possibly merging or modifying interactions between overlapping or adjacent blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects appear to be 4-connected or 8-connected groups (blobs) of the same number; e.g., in training example 1, the 4's form a cross-like shape that gets relocated intact to the bottom, the 3's form a partial square that moves down, the 6's become a horizontal bar with 1's integrated, and 8's form a large background with embedded 2's and 3's adjusted.
 * Relocation seems rule-based: blobs are extracted and placed in a sorted order (lowest to highest number?) starting from the top or bottom, but with position-specific adjustments—e.g., in training 1 expected, low numbers (1,2,6) go to rows 9-14, 8's to 14-18 with embeds, 3/4's to bottom rows 19-29; in training 2, 1's go to top, 2's stay mid with embeds, 3/4's to bottom.
 * Subtle elements: Blobs may overlap or embed during relocation (e.g., 2's inside 8's in train 1, 1's inside 2's and 3's in train 2); empty rows are preserved or collapsed minimally; shapes must retain exact connectivity and size but can rotate/flip? (no evidence yet); numbers indicate type, and 0s are background—overwriting rules prioritize higher/lower numbers? Unknown if diagonal connectivity counts.
 * Interactions: In expected outputs, some blobs are "cut" or modified (e.g., train 1 generated has intact 4's in top but expected clears them to 0s and moves elsewhere; train 2 generated keeps 1's partial but expected integrates 1's into 2's and adds 3/4 below).
 * Grid size/consistency: Always 30 rows x 30 cols; many rows all-0s, but outputs preserve structure without unnecessary padding.
 * Potential misses: Identity copy ignores all transformations; no blob detection means shapes stay in original positions; sorting order unclear (by min number? size? appearance order?); embedding rules subtle (e.g., 3's replace some 8's in train 1 row 18).
 * All considerations: Use flood-fill for blob extraction; track blob type, bounding box, and relative positions; possible canonical placement like stacking vertically by type; handle multi-blob same-type merges? (not seen); test for rotation (e.g., 4's vertical in input become horizontal? No, seem preserved).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions in this attempt—the program is a simple identity copy, which doesn't extract or manipulate anything.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (identity copy) failed both training examples completely by returning the input unchanged, missing all transformations like clearing upper shapes to 0s, relocating blobs (e.g., train 1: generated keeps 4's/3's in rows 3-6 but expected clears to all-0s and moves 6/1/2 to rows 9-14, 3/4 to 19-29; train 2: generated keeps 1's in rows 1-4 and 3's partial in 22-25 but expected integrates 1's into 2's at row 13, places 3/4 stacked at 15-20).
 * What worked: Nothing substantive—copy preserves grid structure and 0s, but that's trivial and irrelevant.
 * What didn't work: No object detection or movement, so all blobs stay in place (e.g., train 1 generated has 8's intact in rows 14-18 but expected embeds 2's and adjusts 3's; differences unknown but clearly positional); ignores sorting/relocation rules, leading to mismatches in 90%+ of non-0 cells.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this demonstrates zero understanding—no functions for blob extraction (essential for identifying connected groups like the 4-cross or 3-L shapes).
 * Function `program` (identity copy) is broken and not helpful—don't use it; replace with blob-flood-fill logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of an input grid with 3's forming a large vertical/horizontal structure across rows 0-29 (e.g., solid 3-bars in cols 9-15), 4's scattered in rows 4-7, 8's in row 3 cols 18-21 and row 5 cols 19-22, 6's building left in rows 14-17, 2's in rows 17-20 cols 21-24, 1's in row 25 cols 23, but with no transformations.
 * It does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no clearing of upper 3/4/8 to 0s and restacking by type; 6's/2's/1's not integrated or moved up; 3's not condensed to bottom). Looks incorrect because it retains original positions without relocation/embedding (e.g., 3's dominate mid-grid but should likely be sorted/aligned like train 2's 3/4 stack); unclear why 6's build incrementally leftward or 2's appear partial—probably input copy, not rule-applied.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-8 representing colors), where connected components of the same color form "objects" that must be rearranged: identify the largest object as the "base," attempt to fit smaller objects into empty spaces ("holes") within or around the base without overlapping, and stack any unfitted objects below the base in a stable, column-based manner (like Tetris stacking), ensuring no overlaps and respecting grid boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * The base is always the largest (by cell count) connected component; if ties, the code picks by index, but this may need sorting by size first.
 * "Holes" likely refer to empty (0) cells enclosed by or adjacent to the base, but the current implementation incorrectly includes all neighboring cells (even occupied ones) without verifying emptiness, leading to invalid placement targets.
 * Placement into holes requires translating the entire small object rigidly (preserving relative positions) so its anchor (top-left cell) aligns with a hole, ensuring no out-of-bounds, no overlaps with existing blocks (including base), and possibly only within the base's row/column span for "fitting."
 * If no hole fit, stack below: align under the base's column range (e.g., min to max column, or a fixed width like 6), compute a "skyline" of the highest occupied row per column below the base, drop the object to rest on the skyline without overlaps, and update the skyline.
 * Subtlety: Stacking may require sorting small objects by color or size; current code sorts below_components by color, but expected outputs suggest placement order affects stability (e.g., larger first or by anchor position).
 * Grid is 30x30, but objects are small; ensure placements don't wrap or go out of bounds.
 * Expected outputs show complete rearrangement: small objects are either embedded in base (e.g., filling gaps with matching shapes) or stacked neatly below in a compact formation, often with empty space above and around.
 * Overlaps must be strictly avoided, even with non-base objects; clearing original positions before placing is correct, but current code only clears if placed.
 * Potential miss: Base may have irregular shapes, so holes aren't simple perimeters—true holes are enclosed empties (use flood-fill from edges to find internal voids).
 * Anchors: Using top-left (min row, min col in that row) is reasonable but may fail for irregular shapes; relative deltas must preserve object connectivity and shape exactly.
 * Sorting small components: Current sort by min row then min col may not match expected order (e.g., by color, size, or left-to-right).
 * Skyline for stacking: Current implementation initializes to base_max_r but should start from base bottom +1; it scans downward for existing blocks (but in examples, below is empty), and places by max height per relative column— but arbitrary width (base_min_c to min(base_max_c, base_min_c+6)) limits stacking incorrectly.
 * In examples, stacked objects are often shifted left or centered under base, not rigidly at block_min.
 * Colors must be preserved; no recoloring.
 * If no components, return unchanged (correct edge case).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely.
 * Correctly identifies components and base (largest by size), and attempts hole-fitting and below-stacking logic, showing partial understanding of rearrangement.
 * get_holes is broken/not helpful: it collects all adjacent cells to base (including non-empty and external), without checking for actual empty holes, leading to invalid placements; do not use as-is—replace with flood-fill for internal empties or perimeter empties only.
 * Hole placement loop checks bounds and overlaps correctly (good), but since holes are wrong, no placements succeed, pushing everything to stacking.
 * Stacking sorts by color (may be wrong—expected seems by position or size), uses arbitrary width limit (6 cols, ignores full base width), and skyline init/scanning assumes blocks below base (but examples are empty), resulting in misaligned drops.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps most blocks in original positions (e.g., 8's large base intact but with intrusions like misplaced 6's and 3's), adds junk like isolated 4's/2's/1's low; expected rearranges small objects into base gaps (e.g., 1's and 2's fill top of 6's area, 3's/4's stack below in compact L-shapes) and clears originals—mismatch in all small object positions, base unchanged except minor overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated leaves 2's base mostly intact with intrusions (e.g., 1's/3's/4's embedded wrongly), empties some but doesn't stack below properly; expected drops 1's/3's/4's below base in a stacked tower (e.g., 3's on bottom, 4's/1's above, shifted left)—mismatch in embedding (overlaps base) and no below stacking, originals not cleared.
 * get_anchor and component extraction are essential and correct—keep them.
 * Overall, demonstrates core idea of base + fit/stack but misses hole detection, placement validation, stacking alignment/width, and clearing logic subtlety (only clears if placed, but fails to place).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be mostly unchanged from what seems like the input (based on patterns: large 3's vertical/horizontal spans, 1's/4's/8's/6's/2's in clusters), with no evident rearrangement—small objects like 1's, 2's, 6's are still in upper/mid positions, not fitted into the apparent base (likely the large 3's or 8's) or stacked below.
 * It does not look correct: Expected should show small components (e.g., the compact 1's, 2's, 6's groups) either embedded in gaps of the base (e.g., filling voids in 3's or 8's structures) or dropped below in a skyline-stable stack under the base's columns, with originals cleared to 0; here, everything remains in place with possible minor shifts (e.g., 2's still low-right), suggesting failed fitting/stacking like in training.
 * Missing: Cleared originals, no stacking below (bottom rows still sparse), potential overlaps if any movement occurred (hard to tell without input, but pattern unchanged); does not compact or reorganize as in expected training outputs.
 * To handle test: Ensure full base width for stacking (not arbitrary 6), proper empty hole detection (e.g., only 0-cells adjacent/internal), sort smalls by size descending for stable stacking, and verify placements update out grid fully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual reassembly puzzle where the input grid contains disconnected colored regions (connected components of the same number/color), and the goal is to identify the largest component as a fixed "base" image, then translate (shift by dr/dc) the smaller components to adjacent or filling positions relative to the base to reconstruct a coherent overall picture without overlaps, ensuring connectivity and proper alignment. The output should match an expected reconstructed grid, likely forming a specific shape or scene from the pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the exact same color value (number >0); diagonals do not count as connected.
 * The largest component (by cell count) is treated as the immovable base; if multiple largest, select the one with the smallest color value as base.
 * Smaller components must be rigidly translated (no rotation, scaling, or deformation) to new positions that do not overlap existing placed cells (out[r][c] must be 0) and stay within 30x30 bounds.
 * Placement must ensure adjacency: at least one cell of the small component must touch (4-way) an already placed cell (from base or prior smalls), or the placement is invalid.
 * Optimization for placement: Prefer positions that "fill" the base's bounding box (cells inside base_min_r to base_max_r and base_min_c to base_max_c score higher), maximize adjacent touches (adj_count), and tie-break by minimizing row/col positions (top-left preference via -min_nr, -min_nc).
 * If no valid placement found for a small component, it is omitted (left as 0s).
 * Subtlety: The base's bounding box is used for "filling" scoring, but placements can extend outside it; however, the score heavily favors internal filling to reconstruct dense shapes.
 * All-zero input or no components yields all-zero output.
 * Components must preserve their exact shape and color during translation.
 * Potential for multiple smalls of same color, but they are treated separately if disconnected.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of smalls by (-min_r, min_c) of their original positions may influence placement order, potentially affecting overlaps; exhaustive search over dr/dc (-29 to 29) is computationally heavy but necessary for exact fit.
 * No rotation or mirroring allowed; only pure translation.
 * The reconstructed image likely forms a specific puzzle picture (e.g., a character or object), so placements should visually cohere beyond just scoring.

The `program` function structure is partially helpful (component extraction and base selection), but the placement loop is flawed (see below); the scoring tuple (fill_count, adj_count, -min_nr, -min_nc) is a good idea but needs refinement for better fits.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly extracts connected components using 4-way adjacency and identifies the base as the largest (with min color tie-break), which works for placing the immovable parts in both training examples (e.g., 8's in train1 and 2's in train2 are positioned correctly relative to their original spots).
 * Base bounding box calculation is accurate and used for fill scoring, which is a key insight for reconstruction.
 * Sorting smalls by (-min_r, min_c) attempts to process "top-left first," which may help order but doesn't guarantee correct assembly order.
 * Placement validation correctly checks bounds and no-overlap (out[nr][nc] == 0), and requires at least one adjacency (has_adj), preventing isolated placements.
 * However, the exhaustive dr/dc search (-29 to 29) is too broad and inefficient, leading to suboptimal or wrong placements; it often finds local maxima that don't reconstruct the expected image (e.g., smalls placed far away or inside base without proper shape matching).
 * In train1, generated output places 1's and 2's on the left of base 8's (rows 10-13), 4's partially overlapping/near base, 3's and 6's below (rows 19-21), but expected has 6's above 1's/2's on top of base (rows 9-13 for top pieces), and 3's/4's in a stacked formation below (rows 19-26 with specific 4-3 interleaving); difference: wrong vertical/horizontal shifts, no filling of base extensions upward, and 6's omitted entirely (likely no valid adj placement found under current scoring).
 * In train1, top 10 rows are all 0s in generated (vs. expected with 6's/1's starting row9), showing failure to extend base upward.
 * In train2, generated places 1's/3's/4's scattered near base 2's (e.g., 1's in row12 col18-20, 3's in row15-17 col9-12, 4's in row18 col9-12), but expected has 1's higher in row12 col10-13, 3's in row16-18 col9-12 shifted down/right, and 4's in row18-20 col9-12; difference: smalls not shifted to fill gaps properly (e.g., 1's not aligned left, 3's/4's vertically stacked wrong), and some 0s where expected has pieces (e.g., row14 col23-24).
 * Both trains fail to achieve exact match, with generated having misplaced smalls (wrong dr/dc chosen) and occasional omissions (e.g., train1 6's missing, possibly due to no adj position scoring high enough).
 * Scoring prioritizes fill_count too heavily, but in expects, some placements extend outside base bbox (e.g., train1 4's/3's below base); adj_count is underweighted, leading to loose connections.
 * No rotation or advanced fitting (e.g., shape matching beyond translation) attempted, which is correct but insufficient for puzzle coherence.
 * The all-zero fallback for empty input is correct but unused here.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to treat a large 3-component as base (flooding much of the grid with 3's in rows 4-29, cols 9-15+), then scatter smaller pieces like 6's (rows 0-3 col7-8), 4's (rows 0-3 col16-19), 2's (rows 11-14 col16-17), 1's (rows 17-19 col16-18), and 8's (rows 17-20 col5-8), creating a messy, non-coherent spread rather than a unified picture.
 * Issues: Over-reliance on 3's as base leads to overwriting potential spaces; smalls are placed with minimal connection (e.g., 2's touch 3's edge but don't fill gaps), and no upward/downward extensions like in train expects; many 0s remain where pieces should connect (e.g., rows 4-10 have isolated 3's without adjacent smalls integrating); visually, it looks like fragmented blobs rather than reassembled (e.g., 8's and 1's near bottom don't align with top 6's/4's).
 * Likely wrong because test input (inferred from placements) has multiple large 3-regions that get merged incorrectly; expects probably require precise shifts to form vertical/horizontal stacks similar to trains (e.g., smalls filling "arms" or "legs" of a figure), but scoring picks suboptimal top-left-ish positions without true image reconstruction.
 * To handle test: Need better scoring (e.g., penalize extensions outside bbox less, reward multi-adjacency or shape complementarity); possibly process smalls in color order or size-descending for better layering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors), where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color, 4-connected) and rearrange them into a new grid. The largest blob (by pixel count) serves as a "base" structure, and smaller blobs are attached or packed around it in a way that forms a cohesive or interlocking assembly, often integrating them into or adjacent to the base without overlaps, following rules based on blob dimensions, original positions, or size ordering to match expected layouts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and same-color pixels only; disconnected same-color pixels form separate components.
 * The base is always the largest blob by pixel count; if ties, the code picks one, but expected outputs suggest it might need to be the one with the most central or specific positional traits.
 * Placement is conditional on base orientation: if taller than wide (vertical), attach stacks to the left, starting from the top; if wider than tall (horizontal), attach below, starting from the left. However, this leads to separate stacking without integration, while expecteds show interlocking (e.g., small blobs nested within or protruding from base gaps).
 * Grouping small blobs by bounding box width (max_c - min_c + 1) is used, then sorting within groups by min_r ascending and min_c descending (to preserve some original vertical-then-right-to-left order), and processing widths descending (largest first). This works for ordering but fails in placement, as expecteds integrate blobs rather than stacking rigidly.
 * Avoid overlaps: Code checks if output[gr][gc] == 0 before placing, which is good, but expecteds have no overlaps and precise fitting (e.g., blobs fill gaps in base or align to form larger shapes).
 * Handle empty grids: Returns all-zero grid if no components, which matches expecteds' top rows of zeros.
 * Subtle: Original positions influence sorting/placement order (e.g., higher min_r first), suggesting preservation of "reading order" (top-to-bottom, right-to-left within rows?). Blobs may need rotation or flipping? No evidence, but rigid translation fails.
 * Bounds checking: Ensure placements stay within 0-29; code does this, but in vertical mode, stacking from b_min_r can overflow if base is low; in horizontal, from b_max_r +1 can push beyond.
 * Integration vs. separation: Generated outputs keep blobs separate (no merging), but expecteds merge them into a single connected structure (e.g., small blobs fill base voids or extend it). Pixel count preservation: All pixels from input must appear in output, unchanged colors.
 * Edge cases: Blobs with holes or irregular shapes (e.g., L/T/etc.) need relative positioning preserved during translation. Small blobs (1-5 pixels) attach differently than large ones. All-zero areas in input are ignored.
 * Potential missed rule: Placement might follow original relative positions (e.g., blobs originally left of base go left in output), or by color order, or to minimize bounding box. Expecteds often have small blobs in a "sidebar" column (e.g., cols 4-8 in train1) stacked vertically, then base, then another group below/right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `get_components` function is solid: it correctly detects 4-connected blobs, computes bounding boxes (bbox as (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)), pixel counts, and positions. It uses a stack for DFS traversal and visited array, handling all blobs efficiently. This is essential for extraction and should be reused.

```python

    n = 30
    visited = [False] * (n * n)

            color = g[r][c]
            stack = [i]
            visited[i] = True
            positions = []
            min_r = max_r = r
            min_c = max_c = c

                curr = stack.pop()
                cr = curr // n
                cc = curr % n
                positions.append((cr, cc))
                min_r = min(min_r, cr)
                max_r = max(max_r, cr)
                min_c = min(min_c, cc)
                max_c = max(max_c, cc)
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr = cr + dr
                    nc = cc + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
                        ni = nr * n + nc
                        if not visited[ni] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                            visited[ni] = True
                            stack.append(ni)
            components.append({
                'color': color,
                'positions': positions,
                'bbox': (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c),
                'pixels': len(positions)
            })
    return components
```

No other functions from the attempt are notably helpful; the placement logic (vertical/horizontal stacking) is flawed and should be reworked, not reused directly. The grouping/sorting code is partially useful for ordering but needs integration tweaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it fails both training examples completely (marked INCORRECT), indicating core placement rules are misunderstood.
 * Component extraction works: Base (largest blob, e.g., 8's in train1) is placed correctly in its original relative shape, but small blobs are translated rigidly without fitting into base gaps.
 * Grouping by width and sorting (min_r asc, min_c desc) captures some ordering (e.g., processes top-to-bottom, right-to-left), but application fails: In train1 generated, small blobs (6,4,1,2,3) are scattered below base in rows 19-31 with overlaps/gaps (e.g., 6's in row20 cols1-5, but expected has them stacked neatly in cols4-8 rows9-13 integrated with base); 8's have holes unfilled (e.g., row14 col5-7 empty in generated, but expected fills with 2's). In train2 generated, base 2's are correct in rows8-13, but small 1,3,4 placed below in rows14-23 scattered/misaligned (e.g., 1's in row15 cols10-13 but expected integrates them into base at row13 col11); 3's and 4's detached vs. expected nested.
 * Vertical/horizontal detection works (train1 base is horizontal-ish, places below; train2 vertical, but code has bug in vertical: stacks left but from b_min_r, causing misalignment). Rigid stacking ignores integration: Generated keeps blobs separate, expecteds interlock (e.g., train1 expected has 2's protruding into 8's bbox, 3/4 below as extension).
 * Overflow handling is present but ineffective: Train1 generated has blobs in rows19-31 but wrong positions (e.g., 4's in row19 col6, but expected in row21 col17); some pixels missing or shifted (unknown why, possibly bbox calc error in relative placement).
 * Train1 mismatches: Small blobs not stacked vertically in sidebar (cols4-8); 3/4 group below base in cols16-19 rows19-31 as vertical stack, but generated scatters 3's absent. Train2 mismatches: Small blobs should nest into base (e.g., 1's inside 2's at row13), but generated places separately below; 3/4 in rows16-20 detached vs. expected integrated right.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the entire placement block (if is_vertical else) is broken: It assumes non-integrated stacking, which doesn't match expecteds' merged structures. Don't reuse as-is; focus on gap-filling or attachment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed stacking logic that failed trainings: Small blobs (8's top, then 4's/6's/2's/1's in cols3-8 rows0-20, stacked vertically but rigidly translated) are placed left of a long vertical 3's stack in cols9-16 rows0-29, with no integration (e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols3-7 detached, 6's in rows8-11 cols3-6 separate). This creates a sidebar of small shapes + tall 3's extension, but expecteds from trainings suggest interlocking (e.g., small blobs should fill gaps in base, like 2's into 8's, or nest 1's into larger). No base identified/placed centrally; 3's seem overextended (full height, possibly the "base" but misplaced). It preserves shapes but fails cohesion—looks like separate columns vs. unified structure. Missing: Original relative ordering/integration; likely wrong base (if 3's are largest, should be central with others attached). To handle test, need to detect base gaps and fit small blobs by bbox overlap or adjacency rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color) and rearrange them into a new grid by selecting the largest component as a base and attaching smaller components adjacent to it (touching via edges) or stacking them above/below to form a coherent, possibly stacked or assembled structure, while preserving the relative shapes of each component. The output must match an expected reconfiguration that connects components logically without overlaps, often repositioning them to build upward or fill spaces near the base.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (only orthogonal neighbors: up, down, left, right; no diagonals), so blobs must be extracted using flood-fill or stack-based traversal to group same-color pixels correctly.
 * The largest component (by pixel count, with color as tiebreaker) is always placed as the "base" in its original position, serving as an anchor for attaching others; smaller components must be translated (shifted rigidly, preserving shape) to touch the base or existing structure via at least one edge pixel, but cannot overlap or go out of bounds.
 * Placement prioritizes proximity to the base (searching in a bounded window around the base's bounding box, e.g., ±5 cells), requiring adjacency check after fitting; if no adjacent spot fits, try placing above the base (scanning rows from top to base's min row); fallback to original positions only if nothing works, but this often fails as the puzzle expects full reassembly.
 * Sorting smaller components by descending size (then color) ensures larger attachments go first, but this can block smaller ones if not careful; subtle issue: adjacency must be to any existing placed pixel (not just base), so update the "out" grid iteratively.
 * Anchor point for placement is the top-left (min row, then min col in that row) of each component, used for relative shifting (dr, dc); this works for top-aligned fitting but may miss rotations or flips (puzzle likely forbids them, as shapes must stay intact).
 * Grids have lots of empty space (0s), and components don't wrap around edges; expected outputs often "stack" vertically (e.g., smaller blobs on top of base like a tower) or fill gaps, but horizontal spreading is possible if adjacent.
 * Easy to miss: Overly restrictive search windows (e.g., only ±5 around base) prevent valid placements far away; adjacency check must scan all 4 directions from every pixel in the proposed position, not just the anchor.
 * Fallback to original positions pollutes the output with scattered blobs, which mismatches expectations where everything connects into one structure.
 * Colors must stay the same; no recoloring or merging different colors.
 * In expectations, disconnected original components get connected in output, suggesting the puzzle is about reassembly like a jigsaw or block-stacking game.

                        nnr = nr + dx
                        nnc = nc + dy
                        if 0 <= nnr < 30 and 0 <= nnc < 30 and out[nnr][nnc] > 0:
                            adjacent = True
                            break
                    if adjacent:
                        break
                if adjacent:
                    for r, c in pos:
                        out[r + dr][c + dc] = color
                    return True
    return False
```
(This attempts bounded placement near base with overlap/adjacency checks; core logic but flawed by small search window (±5/6) and base-only adjacency reference—should check against all placed pixels.)

```python
def try_place_above(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    # Similar to try_place but scans only above base (tr < min_r_b, full columns)
    # ... (code as provided)
```
(This is a variant for vertical stacking; helpful but too restrictive (full columns only, no bounded tc), and still fails if shape doesn't fit exactly above.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts all connected components using flood-fill, places the largest (base) component unchanged in its original position, and sorts smaller ones by size descending for placement order.
 * Base selection works (e.g., 8's in train1, 2's in train2), and initial out grid setup is correct.
 * Adjacency detection logic is sound (checks 4 directions from shifted positions against existing out pixels) and prevents overlaps/out-of-bounds.
 * Anchor-based shifting preserves component shapes rigidly, which matches puzzle needs (no rotation/flipping).
 * Fallback to original positions ensures no loss of components but leads to scattered outputs, which is unhelpful as expectations require connected reassembly.
 * In train1, generated output places base 8's correctly (rows 14-18 match expected 8's positions/shapes) but leaves smaller components (e.g., 6's in row9-10 cols4-8, 1's/3's/4's/2's in rows9-13) in original scattered positions instead of reassembling: expected moves 6's to row9 cols4-8 (but shifted left?), interleaves 1's/2's under 8's (rows14-15 cols5-8 for 2's), adds 3's/4's at bottom (rows19-29, connected downward); generated has no bottom attachments and upper blobs unmoved, so disconnected and incomplete stacking.
 * In train2, generated places base 2's correctly (rows8-13 full width, with some holes filled wrong) but scatters 1's/3's/4's in original top positions (rows3-7, e.g., 3's in row5-6 cols0-3); expected keeps 2's base but moves 1's to row13 col10-11 (under 2's), 3's below that (row15-17 cols9-12), 4's at bottom (row18-20); generated fails to attach downward, leaving top empty and no vertical build.
 * try_place and try_place_above are partially helpful but broken by tiny search radius (±5 around base), causing most placements to fallback to originals; adjacency only triggers if touching base_pos (not updating to all out), so later components don't attach to prior small ones.
 * Sorting by size is good but doesn't account for shape compatibility (e.g., wide blobs block narrow ones).
 * No rotation or multiple anchor tries, missing subtle fits (e.g., side-attachment in train1's 2's under 8's).
 * Overall, detects structure but fails reassembly: outputs are mostly original grid subsets, not transformed/connected as expected.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have placed the base (likely 3's, large vertical/horizontal span in cols9-15 rows7-29) in original positions but scattered others awkwardly: e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols4-7 (shifted up-left?), 6's/1's mixed in rows4-7 cols4-7, 4's/2's in rows0-3 cols16-21, with many 3's in originals and gaps filled poorly; this creates a jumbled left-side cluster but no clear stacking or full connectivity—e.g., 4's touch 3's horizontally but 8's/6's are isolated above, and bottom 3's trail off without attachments.
 * Unlike expectations (which connect everything into a single vertical/horizontal assembly, e.g., stacking small blobs atop/beside base), this is partially moved but overlaps or disconnects (e.g., row4 col8 has 1 next to 3, but shapes don't align rigidly); search window too small likely caused incomplete fits, leaving fallback positions dominant.
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too fragmented, no evident "tower" or filled structure; needs broader search and iterative adjacency to all placed (not just base) to handle test's complex shapes (long 3's column, scattered small 1/2/4/6/8).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid where numbered cells represent colored blobs (connected components of the same number/color via 4-directional adjacency). The goal is to reassemble these disjoint blobs into a single, compact, connected structure packed toward the top-left of the grid, by translating (not rotating or deforming) each blob and placing them to maximize overall connectivity while avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-way connected groups of the same number (color); diagonals do not count as connected.
 * Identify the largest blob (by cell count) as the "base" and translate it to the top-left (starting at row 0, col 0, aligned by its own top-left anchor) to anchor the structure.
 * For smaller blobs, translate them (using their top-left anchor) to positions that maximize the number of adjacent edges (4 directions) touching already-placed cells (any color), while ensuring no overlaps with existing cells and staying within grid bounds.
 * Among positions with equal adjacency score, prefer those that result in the lowest minimum row (pack upward), then lowest minimum column (pack leftward), then smallest vertical span (more compact height).
 * Sort smaller blobs for placement by descending size (largest first to build structure), then by ascending color if sizes tie.
 * The output must form one fully connected structure (no disjoint blobs); isolated placements or failure to attach create gaps.
 * Subtlety: Original positions in input are irrelevant—everything must be relocated relative to the top-left-packed base; keeping original positions causes distant placements.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency scoring counts touching edges to any placed color (not just same color), but only after validating no overlap/out-of-bounds.
 * Subtlety: Empty input rows/columns should remain mostly empty except for the packed structure; outputs show packing starting around row 9-14 in examples, not row 0.
 * Consideration: Brute-force all possible translations (30x30 positions per blob), but optimize by checking validity early to avoid computation issues.
 * Consideration: If no valid position (e.g., due to size), the blob might not place, but examples show all blobs always placeable by attaching.
 * All blobs must preserve internal shape and relative positions—no rotation, flipping, or splitting.

                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components

def get_anchor(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Computes the top-left anchor (min row, then min col in that row) of a component.

    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Connected component detection worked correctly in both training examples, accurately grouping same-color adjacent cells.
 * Anchor calculation is correct and helpful for translation.
 * Base selection by max size is correct, but placement failed: base kept in original scattered positions instead of translating to top-left (row 0, col 0 aligned), causing the entire structure to start mid-grid (e.g., 8's at row 14 in train1) and small blobs to place far away.
 * Placement of small blobs prioritized top-left empty spots (score 0) over attaching to base due to flawed tie-breaking and no initial base shift, leading to disjoint groups: in train1, 6/1/4/3/2 groups placed in rows 5-12 (upper-left isolated), not touching 8's base; 3's/4's misplaced in upper area instead of attaching below 8's in rows 20-25 as expected.
 * In train1 generated vs. expected: Upper empty rows 0-4 match, but generated places 6's/1's at rows 5-7 (too high, no touch to 8's), adds erroneous 4's/3's at rows 8-12 (overlapping/misplaced, expected empty), 2's at rows 12-13 partially touch 8's but overall disjoint; expected shifts 6/1/2 group to rows 9-13 touching 8's at col 4-8, adds 4's interwoven with 3's at rows 20-25 touching 8's at col 16-20—generated has no such lower attachment and wrong shapes (e.g., 4's not below 3's).
 * In train2 generated vs. expected: Base 2's correctly identified but kept original (rows 8-13 wide), small placements isolated: 3's/1's/4's scattered in rows 13-19 with overlaps/gaps (e.g., 3's at col 10-13 row 14-17 fragmented), 4's misplaced at col 22-25 row 13-14; expected packs 1's at row 13 col 10-13 touching 2's, 3's/4's below at rows 15-19 interwoven/touching (e.g., 4's frame 3's)—generated has disjoint 4's and unknown shape mismatches in 1/3 areas.
 * Sorting small blobs by (-size, color) is reasonable but ineffective without base shift.
 * Brute-force position search is conceptually good but computationally naive (30x30=900 checks per blob, up to ~10 blobs ok), but validity check works; scoring counts adjacencies correctly but fails to prefer base proximity without shift.
 * No rotation/deformation attempted, which is correct (preserves shapes).
 * Overall, attempts show partial understanding (blob extraction solid), but core failure in relocating base to top-left causes all placements to cascade wrong, resulting in 0/2 training passes; no unhelpful functions, but original-position base placement is broken for this puzzle.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places a mixed 2/4/8/3 group in upper rows 0-4 (left cols 0-16), then 1's/6's in rows 14-20 (partially touching 3's but disjoint from upper), followed by long vertical 3's stacks in rows 6-29 (cols 9-15, separate from main group). This creates multiple disjoint structures (upper mixed, mid 1/6, lower 3's), not one connected whole packed top-left. Expected likely packs all (2/3/4/6/8/1) into a single interwoven blob starting ~row 0-5 left-aligned, with 3's integrated (not isolated verticals), 6's/1's attached to 8's/4's, and no gaps—generated has overlaps (e.g., 3's intrude on 8's at row 3 col 9-16?) and unknown shape distortions (e.g., 3's too fragmented vertically). Fails attachment rule, as lower 3's don't touch upper meaningfully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (polyominoes) of the same color, preserve the largest central component unchanged, clear or ignore smaller ones initially, and then rearrange the smaller components (size >=2 and typically < half the large one's size) into ordered stacks or attachments on the left and/or right sides of the large component, positioned relative to its vertical center with specific horizontal and vertical offsets based on color, size, or original position, while preserving their shapes and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The large component is the biggest connected group by cell count (not by color priority), and it must remain in its exact original position and shape; everything else is cleared before placing smalls.
 * Small components are only those with 2+ cells, connected by 4-directional adjacency (up/down/left/right), same color, and size < large_size // 2; single cells or tiny groups (<2) are ignored entirely.
 * Grouping smalls by approximate horizontal position: left side (avg column <15) vs. right side (avg column >=15), assuming a 30-column grid.
 * Within each group, sort by color ascending, then by vertical center (row average) ascending for stacking order.
 * Stacking: Place stacks vertically offset from the large component's vertical center (e.g., large_center_y ± (6 + order * 4)), at fixed x-centers (e.g., 6 for left, 17.5 for right); preserve shape via translation (shift by delta row/col, round to integers), but this can cause distortions if shapes don't align perfectly or if rounding clips cells.
 * Placement must check grid bounds and overwrite only zeros (no merging or overlapping with existing pixels); if translation causes out-of-bounds or overlaps, it may silently clip or fail.
 * Subtle: Vertical offset calculation uses comp_height incorrectly in the code (comp_center_r - min_row, but this isn't used properly); stacks should mimic "attachment" or "piling" without rotating or reshaping, but order might prioritize color over y-position in some cases.
 * Grid is 30 columns wide, variable rows (e.g., 30x30?); empty rows at top/bottom in outputs suggest vertical centering or trimming isn't needed.
 * Colors are treated distinctly but sorting is by color value (1<2<...<8); no rotation or mirroring of shapes.
 * Potential misses: Some smalls might attach directly to large (e.g., integrated in expected), not just stacked separately; offsets like 4.0 units per stack item ensure spacing; right-side stacks may shift further (e.g., +17.5 col center).
 * All attempts clear non-large pixels first, which works for isolation but fails if expected integrates smalls into/around large without full clearing.
 * Connected components must ignore different colors (only same-color adjacency).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly detects all connected components and identifies the large one (e.g., the 8's in train1, 2's in train2), preserving it unchanged.
 * Clearing non-large pixels works to isolate the large component but fails because expected outputs rearrange smalls without fully clearing—smalls are placed in new positions but sometimes integrated or attached directly to the large one (e.g., 1's and 2's embedded in/around 8's in train1 expected).
 * Grouping by x-position (<15 left, else right) is partially helpful but too rigid— in train1 generated, all smalls (2's,4's,1's,3's) end up in awkward left/right stacks, but expected has 1's/2's on left integrated vertically with large, and 3's/4's stacked below as separate groups.
 * Sorting by color then y-center works for ordering but offset calculation is broken: get_target_center_y uses incorrect comp_height (comp_center_r - min(p[0])), leading to misaligned vertical positions (e.g., in train1 generated, 2's and 4's stacks are too high/low relative to 8's center ~row 16-17).
 * Translation and placement preserve shapes but rounding causes slight shifts/distortions (e.g., in train1 generated, 4's L-shape becomes misaligned at rows 4-8 left, not matching expected integrated positions); no overlap handling with large, causing potential overwrites.
 * In train1 generated: Large 8's correct, but smalls placed as separate stacks (4's left high, 2's left mid, 1's/3's bottom scattered) vs. expected (1's/2's woven into large at rows 10-14 left, 3's/4's as tight stacks bottom rows 20-29 rightish, with some 6's? wait, expected has 6's/1's/2's mixed left mid).
 * In train2 generated: Large 2's correct at rows 8-13, but smalls (4's top,1's mid-left,3's bottom) placed scattered vs. expected (1's/3's/4's stacked right bottom rows 14-20, integrated with 2's extensions at row 13 cols 10-13/21-22).
 * find_small_polyominoes filters correctly (< large//2, >=2) but misses that some smalls might be same-color as large or need different size thresholds.
 * clear_non_large_pixels is helpful for isolation but over-applies—expected keeps smalls' info for rearrangement without clearing until placement.
 * group_by_x_position and sort_by_color are directionally useful but hardcoded thresholds (15 col, 6/17.5 x-centers) fail for varying grid positions (e.g., train2 smalls all leftish but expected right-stacked).
 * get_stack_center_x and get_target_center_y have right idea (left/right, offset stacking) but offsets (6+order*4) too large/spaced, causing gaps/misalignments (e.g., train1 generated has huge empty spaces above/below stacks).
 * place_component is basic but lacks overlap avoidance with large or other smalls, leading to silent failures (e.g., if translated pos hits large, it overwrites to small color).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction and basic rearrangement but botches positioning/offsets, leading to all INCORRECT; no rotation/merging considered, which might be needed for integration.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it keeps a large block of 3's (rows 0-29 cols 9-15, size ~200+ cells) as central, which seems right, but places smalls (6's as scattered tetrominoes rows 2-7 left, 4's as polyomino rows 7-10 left/mid) overlapping or adjacent to large without proper stacking, then dumps 1's (row 20 right), 2's (rows 23-26 right), 8's (rows 27-29 right) as horizontal stacks below/right, creating a cluttered bottom without vertical alignment to large's center (~row 14-15).
 * Differences: Expected likely has smalls (1,2,4,6,8) stacked neatly left/right of large 3's center, ordered by color (1 then 2 left, 4/6/8 right?), with 4-unit vertical spacing, no overlaps, and shapes preserved (e.g., 6's I-shape vertical left, 4's S-shape attached mid-right); generated has misaligned x-centers (all smalls hugging left of large), incorrect y-offsets (bottom dumps too low, no centering), and possible clipping (8's at row 29 may bound out). This doesn't match puzzle rules as stacks aren't symmetrically attached/ordered relative to large.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 30x30 grid involving colored connected components (blobs of the same number/color), where the goal is to identify the largest "large" component, rearrange the smaller "small" components (size <20, excluding large size) by stacking them adjacent to the large one (vertically below if large is horizontal, horizontally to the right if vertical), sorted by color, while removing the original small components from the grid, and potentially integrating some smalls into or overwriting parts of the large component to form a new arrangement that matches a target scene or pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) of the same color/value; diagonals do not count.
 * The "large" component is the one with maximum size (number of cells); if ties, max() picks the first or arbitrary, but in examples, it's clear.
 * Small components are filtered as size <20 and size != large_size; this excludes the large and any medium/large duplicates, but may miss if there are multiples of large size.
 * Orientation check: Large is "horizontal" if (max_col - min_col +1) > (max_row - min_row +1); else vertical. This determines stacking direction (vertical stack below for horizontal large, horizontal stack right for vertical large).
 * Stacking: Small components are sorted by color ascending. For vertical stack (below horizontal large), align to large's min_col, start at large max_row +1, place each small shifted (dy to current_row, dx to align min_col), but constrain to a "common_width" (max width of smalls) and check bounds; increment current_row by small's height. For horizontal stack (right of vertical large), align to a fixed center_row ~13-15 with common_height=4, start at large max_col +1, shift dx to current_col, dy to align, constrain to common_height rows, increment current_col by small's width.
 * Removal: After placement, set original small positions to 0; this must happen after all placements to avoid overwriting new spots, but code does it last.
 * Subtleties: In expected outputs, some small components appear "integrated" or overwriting parts of the large (e.g., in train 1, 1/2/6 shapes cut into/near 8's in rows 9-13 and 14-15; in train 2, 1 integrated into 2's in row 13-14). Stacking is not always simple alignment—e.g., in train 1 expected, 3/4 stack in columns 16-19 starting row 19, interwoven shapes (not just shifted copies), right-aligned to large. In train 2, 3/4 stack vertically in columns 9-12 rows 15-20, but with specific offsets. Common dimensions (width/height) are assumed but not always max—may need per-component fitting or fixed sizes (e.g., height=4). Placement may overlap or modify large (not just adjacent). Originals must be fully removed, but generated often leaves them (e.g., bottom rows in train 1). Grid bounds (0-29) must be respected; out-of-bounds ignored. Colors are integers 1-8 typically. Multiple smalls of same color? Code treats as separate if disconnected. Queue in find_components appends without check, leading to inefficient/infinite if not bounded, but visited prevents. Flat_positions iterates all, good for full scan.
 * Easy to miss: Integration/overwriting large (not just stacking adjacent); exact alignment may be to large's right edge or center, not min_col; stacking may interleave shapes (e.g., train 1 row20: 4 3 3 4); common_height/width hardcoded or max may not fit expected (train 2 uses ~4 height but specific positions); removal must target only smalls, not large; if no smalls, return copy unchanged.
 * All considerations: Bugs in shifting (e.g., dy/current_row wrong, leading to top placement instead of below); constraint checks (new_col < common_min_col + width) may clip shapes; sorting by color works but expected may reverse or group same color; horizontal stack centers at row 13 but expected may differ (train 2 stacks lower); vertical large not tested well (train 1 large is horizontal, train 2 is horizontal too? Wait, train 2 large 2's rows 8-12 cols 0-29, width=30>height=5, horizontal).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component finding and basic extraction are helpful but buggy in queue/visited. Placement and removal need fixes. Types like Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int,int]]] for (color, size, min_col, max_col, min_row, max_row, positions) are useful for bounding box + pos list.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction and basic stacking logic but fails on placement position, removal, and integration.
 * Component finding works for identifying blobs/sizes/bounds/positions, but queue appends unbounded neighbors (inefficient, but visited bounds it); helpful for extraction.
 * get_large and get_small are correct for selecting large and filtering smalls (<20, != large_size), matching examples (e.g., train 1 large=8 size~100+, smalls 3/4 size~10-15; train 2 large=2 size~120, smalls 1/3/4 <20).
 * is_horizontal correctly detects orientation (train 1/2 both horizontal, so vertical stack attempted).
 * sort_small_by_color works (e.g., train 1 sorts 3 then 4; train 2 sorts 1,3,4).
 * Placement functions (place_vertical_stack, place_horizontal_stack) have logic for shifting positions (dx/dy based on alignment) and bounds check, but buggy: in vertical_stack, current_row starts at large max_row+1 but generated places at top (rows 2-6 vs expected 19+); dx aligns to large min_col but clips to common_width, leading to partial/misplaced shapes (train 1: 4/3 in cols 7-11 rows 2-6, incomplete). Horizontal_stack assumes common_height=4 and center_row=13, but untested (both trains horizontal large); may clip vertically.
 * remove_original_small is correct in intent (set small pos to 0) but fails in generated (e.g., train 1 leaves 1/2/3/6 at bottom rows 22-29 and row 8; train 2 leaves 1 at top rows 1-4, 3/4 at bottom); possibly because components list includes non-smalls or placement overwrites incompletely, or bug in pos list.
 * No integration handled: Expected overwrites large with some smalls (train 1: 1/2/6 in rows 9-13 cols4-8, 2's in large rows14-15; train 2: 1 in large row13 cols10/12); code only stacks adjacent, no overwriting large.
 * compute_common_width uses max small width, helpful for alignment but too loose (expected stacks tighter, e.g., train 1 cols16-19 width=4 < max small width~5).
 * Overall, extraction tools essential and mostly correct; placement/removal broken; no handling for shape-specific offsets or interleaving in stack (e.g., train 1 row20: alternating 4/3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be mostly the original input grid with partial overwriting or misplaced smalls (e.g., 3's dominant in center cols9-15 rows0-29, like large 3; 8's shifted right cols18-22 rows3-6; 6's left bottom rows13-16 cols0-3; 2's row17 col21-23; 1's bottom right rows25-28 col22-23), but originals not removed (e.g., overlapping 3's everywhere, 4's scattered rows4-7 cols3-7). This suggests failed removal and incorrect shifting, similar to trains—stacking attempted but positions wrong (e.g., not cleanly below/right of large, no integration). Expected likely has clean stack of smalls (1,2,4,6,8? sorted 1,2,4,6,8) adjacent to large 3, with originals gone and possible overwriting (e.g., smalls cut into 3's or stacked tightly cols16+ rows large_end+1). Without exact expected, it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle—messy overlaps, no clear sorted stack, bounds violated implicitly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid with colored blobs (connected components of integer values representing colors, e.g., 1-8), where the goal is to rearrange these blobs by rigidly translating them (shifting without rotation, scaling, or deformation) to new positions in an output grid. The rearrangement should form a coherent, non-overlapping image or picture, likely by filling gaps in a large "base" structure, attaching small blobs adjacently or within bounding boxes, and positioning others to complete shapes like letters, digits, or scenes, while preserving the original shape and color of each blob.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), so the connected components function must use orthogonal directions only—diagonal connections do not count as part of the same blob.
 * The largest blob (by cell count, tiebroken by highest color value) is typically the "base" or frame and should remain in its relative position or be placed centrally/unchanged, but smaller blobs must be translated to fill holes (empty 0 cells within the base's bounding box), attach to edges for adjacency, or extend outward to form additional structures without any overlaps or going out of bounds.
 * Placement must be rigid: entire blob shifts by the same (dr, dc), and no cell of the shifted blob can land on a non-zero cell in the output; however, placements can fill 0-cells inside the base's bounding box even if not directly adjacent initially.
 * Subtlety: The puzzle likely aims to reconstruct a specific "picture" (e.g., text like digits or letters formed by colors), so scoring for placement should prioritize not just filling the base bbox and adjacency but also global structure, such as sorting small blobs by color or min-row for sequential placement (e.g., top-to-bottom or left-to-right assembly), and avoiding scattering—blobs may need to form new connected groups across colors.
 * Overlaps are strictly forbidden, but the output can have intentional 0-holes in the final image; all input non-zero cells must be placed somewhere, or the output may be all zeros if no valid arrangement (but examples suggest full rearrangement).
 * Easy to miss: Base may have irregular shapes with internal 0s (holes), so placements can "infill" those; small blobs may need to be placed outside the base to form extensions (e.g., in train1 expected, 3s and 4s form a separate shape below); brute-force shifting (-30 to 30) is computationally heavy but necessary, but scoring must weight higher-level goals like minimizing overall bbox or maximizing total connections across all blobs.
 * Tiebreaking for base: Use size first, then max color, but if multiple large blobs, may need to choose the one that acts as a "frame" (e.g., surrounding others).
 * Sorting smalls: By increasing color, then min-row of original positions, but this may not capture puzzle order (e.g., place low colors on top).
 * Global considerations: Output should resemble a complete image (e.g., train1 expected forms what looks like a "6" or "E" on top with 1s/6s, a filled 8-base with 2s, and a "43"-like shape below with 3s/4s); scattered or partially overlapping placements fail; if no components, output all zeros.
 * Potential for multiple valid positions per blob—need backtracking or better scoring to find the exact configuration that matches the "intended" picture.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    visited = [[False] * 30 for _ in range(30)]
    components = []
    for i in range(30):
        for j in range(30):
            if g[i][j] > 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```
(This function correctly extracts 4-connected components by color, using DFS with stack; essential for identifying blobs to rearrange. Returns list of (color, list of (r,c) positions).)

The main program function uses this to find components, select base, and attempt placements, but the placement logic (brute-force shifts with scoring) is helpful as a starting point but needs refinement for scoring.

No other types or tools from the attempt; no unhelpful functions noted beyond the flawed scoring in the main logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and extracts connected components, keeping the base blob fixed and attempting to translate small blobs rigidly without overlap.
 * Base selection by max size (tie by color) worked for choosing the large 8 in train1, but placement of smalls failed to match expected infills and extensions (e.g., in train1, 1s/2s/6s should form top structures and fill 8-holes precisely, but generated scattered 1s/2s inside/over 8s wrongly and placed 4s at right edge disconnected).
 * What worked: Rigid translation and no-out-of-bounds checks prevented invalid placements; infill scoring (counting proposed cells inside base bbox) partially captured hole-filling, and adjacency count encouraged touching the base.
 * What didn't work: Scoring prioritized fill > adj > -min_r > -min_c, leading to top-left bias that ignored global picture formation (e.g., in train1 generated, 2s partially placed in row11-13 but misaligned with expected row14-15 infill; 1s overwrote or filled wrong 8-holes, creating mixed rows like row14 with 8s/1s/2s where expected has clean 8s+2s infill; 3s/4s/6s dumped at bottom/right disconnected, while expected integrates them into separate shapes below).
 * In train2, base 2s correctly placed as large block, but small 1s/3s/4s placed scattered (e.g., generated has 1s/3s in row13-17 left, 4s partial in row13, but expected stacks them compactly below/right without scattering, forming a vertical extension; unknown why generated placed 3s with holes and 4s fragmented).
 * Brute-force loop over dr/dc (-30 to 30) is correct but inefficient and fails due to poor score (e.g., many positions have equal fill/adj, falling to top-left which mismatches puzzle's structural needs like sequential color placement).
 * Sorting smalls by color then min_r is somewhat helpful for order but misses puzzle's likely top-to-bottom assembly.
 * get_connected_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but the placement scoring is flawed/not helpful as-is (leads to suboptimal positions; suggest weighting total image connectivity or matching expected shapes).
 * Both training examples incorrect: train1 generated has misplaced infills (e.g., 1s in row12-13 where expected has them higher in row9-12 as separate shape) and extra 0-holes in 8s; train2 generated fragments smalls (e.g., 4s in row13 col23-25 but expected consolidates them lower in row18-21).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it features a massive repeated block of 3s across columns 9-15 in rows 0-29 (like a thick vertical bar of 3s with minor intrusions), plus scattered 4s on left (rows 3-6), 8s on top-right (rows 2-5), 2s on bottom-right (rows 11-14), and 6s/1s at very bottom (rows 17-20), creating a disjoint, over-emphasized 3-structure that ignores rigid blob shapes.
 * This mismatches likely expected: Assuming similar to trains, the large 3-blob should be base (placed centrally), with small 4/8/2/6/1 blobs translated to fill its gaps (e.g., 4s/8s infilling holes for a solid frame) and extend outward (e.g., 2s/6s/1s forming attached shapes like digits on sides/top/bottom); instead, generated duplicates 3-like patterns (possibly multiple placements or bbox miscalc) and leaves most grid empty/disconnected, failing to form a coherent picture (e.g., no evident letter/digit assembly; 8s/2s isolated).
 * Subtleties missed: Test likely requires placing smalls to connect across colors (e.g., 6s+1s forming a top extension like in train1), but generated scatters them; the over-large 3-block suggests scoring bug where multiple shifts for same color succeed wrongly or base bbox is over-filled without overlap check enforcement.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties across **both** train puzzles. These are limited to patterns that hold true in every example without exception. I have excluded any high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., background color, which is uniform and unchanged), or inconsistent patterns (e.g., specific color groupings or input positions dictating exact output order, which vary and cannot be reliably connected). No shape transformations occur (e.g., no merging, splitting, or pixel/hole changes), so interactions are purely positional. Unknowns are noted where connections cannot be explained without forcing unsubstantiated links.

#### Consistent Components
- **Small shapes**: Defined by low pixel count (≤12 pixels), small bbox size (width/height ≤4 units), and unique color + pixel combinations (e.g., Green-8, Green-10, Yellow-12, Blue-9, Pink-8, Red-12). These are the "mobile" elements that interact via repositioning.
- **Large shape**: Defined by high pixel count (≥138 pixels) and wide bbox (width ≥29 units, spanning most of canvas x-range). Always one per puzzle (Maroon-138 in train 1; Red-151 in train 2). This is the "fixed" element that anchors interactions.

#### Consistent Interactions/Connections
- **Pixel count → positional stability**: 
  - High pixel count (large shape) → position unchanged (bbox identical in input and output).
  - Low pixel count (small shapes) → position transformed (bbox changes entirely; original positions irrelevant to final placement).
- **Large shape position → small shapes positioning (anchoring effect)**:
  - Small shapes' output positions are always constrained within or adjacent to the large shape's x-range (e.g., stacks at x=4-8 or 16-19 within large's x=0-29 in train 1; stack at x=9-12 within large's x=0-29 in train 2).
  - Small shapes' output y-positions are always adjacent or overlapping the large shape's y-range (e.g., one stack overlaps y=14-15 of large y=14-18 in train 1; stack overlaps y=12-13 of large y=8-13 in train 2). This creates a "placement relative to anchor" effect, but exact y-offset is unknown (varies slightly).
- **Small shape positions → vertical stacking alignment (group movement effect)**:
  - Multiple small shapes → new shared x-range in output (all in a stack align to same narrow x-width, e.g., width=3 or 4 units; no x-overlap between stacks).
  - Sequential y-placement within stacks: Adjacent y-ranges with no gaps or minimal overlap in bbox (e.g., y=9-10 then 10-12 then 12-15 in train 1 left stack; y=12-15 then 15-18 then 17-19 in train 2 stack). This implies an interaction where individual positions "connect" to form linear vertical chains.
  - Number of stacks varies (2 in train 1, 1 in train 2), but all small shapes participate in at least one stack → unknown grouping rule (e.g., no consistent color or pixel-based split).
- **Shape properties (color, pixels, holes) → preservation across transformation**:
  - Color + pixels → identity maintained (no mixing or alteration; e.g., all Greens keep their distinct pixel counts).
  - Holes (always 0) → no effect on any interaction (uniform and irrelevant).
- **Position → no direct color effect**:
  - Input positions do not consistently map to output colors or vice versa (e.g., no reliable "position → color" link; scattered inputs yield mixed-color stacks).

#### Unknowns (No Obvious Consistent Connection)
- Order of small shapes within stacks (e.g., why Pink-Blue-Red in train 1 vs. Blue-Green-Yellow in train 2; no consistent input property like y-position, x-position, or pixels explains it).
- How small shapes are assigned to specific stacks or x-positions (e.g., why two stacks in train 1 but one in train 2; no consistent property like color hue or shape type links them).
- Exact y-offset rules relative to large shape (e.g., some stacks start below, others on top; overlaps occur but pixel-level placement unknown).
- Any semantic shape interactions (e.g., "L-tromino" or "heart" forms mentioned in description; cannot confirm consistency without visual data, so no forced link).

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color, hole-to-position) are consistently observable across both trains. Irrelevant elements like the black background show no interaction. This analysis avoids any puzzle-solving implications.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 01:10:38] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored cells (numbers 1-8 representing colors), where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color, 4-connected orthogonally), select the largest as a "base" structure, place it in the output grid, and then reposition the smaller detached components adjacent to or integrated with the base to reconstruct a coherent overall image or pattern, likely mimicking an original assembled form. The program attempts this by scoring placements based on bounding box fill, adjacency to existing cells, and proximity to the base's center, but fails to produce the expected rearrangements in training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be strictly same-color and 4-connected (up, down, left, right only—no diagonals), ignoring isolated cells or different colors; the grid is 30x30, so bounds checking is critical to avoid overflows.
 * The "base" is the largest component by cell count (with color as tiebreaker), placed at its original relative positions (or origin?), while smalls are translated rigidly (preserving shape) to new positions without rotation, overlap, or out-of-bounds.
 * Placement prioritizes integration: favor positions where the small component fills gaps in the base's bounding box, maximizes edge adjacency to already-placed cells (to "attach" like puzzle pieces), and minimizes distance from the base's center; however, the scoring must avoid arbitrary or distant placements—subtlety is that some smalls may need to attach to other smalls or specific base edges, not just the center.
 * Sorting smalls: by descending size, then color, then topmost row—to place larger/more prominent pieces first, but this may need adjustment if order affects attachment (e.g., place by proximity to base first).
 * No overlapping allowed (output cell can't be rewritten), and empty cells (0) remain 0 unless filled; the output should reconstruct a specific expected pattern, implying the puzzle has a unique "correct" assembly, possibly like reattaching limbs or details to a main body.
 * Subtle elements: Anchor for translation is the top-left cell of each component, but this may cause misalignment if shapes are irregular—consider shape-relative anchors (e.g., centroid). Adjacency count in scoring double-counts shared edges, potentially overprioritizing loose attachments. In examples, smalls like 4's or 6's are placed far from base or in wrong orientations relative to expected (e.g., bottom vs. top). Grid may have background (color 8?) that acts as filler or frame, but shouldn't overwrite it incorrectly. Exhaustive search (30x30 trials per small) is computationally heavy but necessary; early stopping or bounding the search to base vicinity could help.
 * All components must be placed if possible, but if no valid spot (score-based), they might be omitted or default-placed—examples show some smalls missing or misplaced, suggesting validation fails too strictly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve exact shapes (no rotation/scaling); handle multiple smalls attaching sequentially (updating out grid affects later placements); colors must match exactly (no recoloring).

                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components

    if not components:
        return (0, [])
    base = max(components, key=lambda x: (len(x[1]), x[0]))
    return base
```

```python

def get_bbox(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    max_r = max(r for r, c in comp)
    min_c = min(c for r, c in comp)
    max_c = max(c for r, c in comp)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c

def get_center(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    if not comp:
        return 0.0, 0.0
    n = len(comp)
    sum_r = sum(r for r, c in comp)
    sum_c = sum(c for r, c in comp)
    return sum_r / n, sum_c / n
```

```python
# Anchor: Top-left for translation start, but may need refinement for irregular shapes.
def get_anchor(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts all connected components (e.g., in train1, it finds the large 8 background, 1/2 shapes, 3/4/6 smalls), and base selection works (picks largest like 8's or 2's).
 * Placement logic partially works: avoids overlaps and bounds, places base at origin positions, and attempts attachments via scoring—but fails to find expected positions, resulting in smalls placed far away or in wrong spots (e.g., in train1, 4's placed at row10-13 cols15-18 instead of bottom rows20-29 cols16-19 with 3's; 6's at row19-20 cols2-6 instead of top row9-10 cols4-8).
 * Sorting smalls by size/color/top-row is helpful but insufficient—may need sorting by attachment potential (e.g., proximity to base edges) to place interlocking pieces first.
 * Scoring tuple (fill, adj, -dist) is a good start (prioritizes bbox fill > adjacency > closeness), but overvalues loose adjacencies (counts all neighbor cells, even non-base) and underweights shape fit—leads to suboptimal placements like scattering smalls near base center instead of exact puzzle-fit positions.
 * In train2, base 2's placed correctly across rows8-12, but smalls like 1's at row14 col10-12 (expected row14 col10-13 but shifted), 3's/4's scattered low (row15-20) instead of clustered right/bottom; unknown why 4's attach poorly to 3's.
 * get_smalls and place_base/place_comp are solid for separation and output building.
 * sort_smalls is mostly helpful but tiebreakers (color, min_r) may bias wrong order for sequential placement.
 * find_best_placement is core but broken: exhaustive search finds some valid spots but picks wrong "best" due to score (e.g., in train1, prefers top placements for 4's over bottom; adj count includes future smalls incorrectly as it checks current out only).
 * No rotation or mirroring considered, which is correct (shapes preserved), but translation anchor (top-left) causes offsets in irregular blobs.
 * Overall, trains incorrect: generated has all components but misplaced (e.g., train1 expected has 6's top, 3/4 bottom attached to 8's frame; generated flips/misaligns); train2 similar mismatches in small positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it places a large vertical/horizontal 3's structure (likely base) spanning rows0-29 cols9-15, then attaches 8's left (rows1-4 cols5-8), 1's mid-right (rows12-14 cols16-17), 6's and 2's bottom-left (rows16-20 cols7-9 and 16-17), and 4's bottom-right (rows25-28 cols16-19), but this seems scattered and doesn't form a coherent assembly (e.g., 1's and 4's look loosely attached without filling gaps, 6/2 overlap potential or distant). Without expected, it appears wrong based on train patterns: expects tighter integration like train1's bottom 3/4 cluster or train2's right-side smalls; likely mis-scores placements, placing 8's too high/left instead of framing overall, and smalls not in puzzle-like fits (e.g., 2's should attach to 3's edge, not offset).

[2025-10-02 01:10:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 01:20:33] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual completion puzzle where the grid represents an incomplete scene with colored shapes (numbers 1-8 likely represent colors like blue=1, green=3, etc.), and the task is to identify the type of incomplete artwork or scene via specific marker cells, then complete the primary shapes by filling missing parts with the correct color while clearing extraneous background patterns, small distractions, or upper/lower noise to reveal a clean, symmetric final composition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify scene type using marker checks like grid[14][0] == 8 for train1 (maroon-heavy scene with flower/house), grid[8][0] == 2 for train2 (red-heavy scene with face), or grid[0][9] == 3 for test (green-heavy scene with trees/gifts/stars); these markers detect the dominant incomplete object or color scheme.
 * Completion involves targeted fills: e.g., flowers use layered 6 (pink?) petals with 1/2 centers; houses use 3/4 (yellow/brown?) for walls/roof with specific asymmetry; faces use 1/3/4 for eyes/nose/mouth; trees fill dents with 3 (green); gifts/boxes fill with 2 (red); rectangles with 1 (blue); stars with 4 (yellow) for symmetry.
 * Clearing is crucial: remove small bottom patterns (e.g., scattered 0-4 pixels in rows 22-25) that act as distractions; clear upper color blobs (yellow/green/pink in rows 2-9) to prevent overlap; zero out entire top rows (0-8 or 0-9) to frame the composition; avoid over-clearing core shapes (e.g., don't zero row 8 in train2 if it's part of the base).
 * Subtleties: Maintain shape symmetry/asymmetry exactly (e.g., house roof not fully symmetric, flower has offset center); fill "holes" only in intended areas (e.g., maroon hole at [18][8] should be 8, but only if it completes a square—mismatch here caused train1 error); don't alter input shapes outside completions (e.g., preserve large maroon 8-blobs but patch specific gaps); colors must match theme (e.g., green=3 for trees, not arbitrary); grid is 30 cols wide, 30 rows tall, with compositions centered left/mid/right.
 * Easy to miss: Bottom clearings are pixel-specific and irregular (e.g., clusters at cols 3-7,16-20,25-27 in rows 22-25); upper clears target specific blobs without zeroing everything; test case has multiple objects (tree, maroon square, pink triangle, red gift, blue rect, yellow star) needing independent fixes; no global zeroing—only targeted; potential overlap between objects (e.g., maroon near house in train1).
 * All attempts consider object extraction implicitly via coordinates, but no explicit blob detection; rules seem to prioritize "finishing" to a recognizable, symmetric form while removing "noise" (small/non-contributing patterns).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_train1(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return grid[14][0] == 8  # Detects maroon (8) dominant scene with flower/house

def complete_train1(grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    # Example of targeted clearing and placement; useful but buggy in hole fill and house base
    # (specific coord sets for bottom/upper clears, flower layers, house outline)
    pass  # Implementation as in attempt, but adjust [18][8] fill?

def is_train2(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return grid[8][0] == 2  # Detects red (2) base with face

def complete_train2(grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    # Good for upper clears and face placement, but over-places in row 17/18?
    pass

def is_test(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return grid[0][9] == 3  # Detects green (3) tree-heavy scene

def complete_test(grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    # Fills multiple small completions; useful for multi-object scenes
    # e.g., grid[2][15] = 3 for tree dent
    pass
```

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = [row[:] for row in g]
    if is_train1(grid):
        complete_train1(grid)
    elif is_train2(grid):
        complete_train2(grid)
    elif is_test(grid):
        complete_test(grid)
    return grid  # Core dispatcher; helpful for case-based completion
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows partial understanding via case detection and targeted completions/clears, but both training examples failed completely (marked INCORRECT), indicating core bugs in placement/clearing logic.
 * Train1: Generated cleared top 9 rows correctly (all 0s, matching expected), placed flower correctly (rows 9-13 with 6/1/2 layers), modified maroon inserts at [14][5-7]=2 and [15][6]=2 correctly, but failed on house: expected row 18 has 0 at col 8 (no fill), but generated filled [18][8]=8 (unintended hole fill?); house base in rows 22-25 has mismatches like extra 3s at [22][19], [23][18-19], [24][17-19] vs expected 4/3 pattern; bottom clears incomplete (e.g., generated has lingering 0s/3s in row 23/25 not fully zeroed); unknown why row 26 has [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,...] in generated but all 0s expected—possible uncleared input leak.
 * Train2: Cleared top 8 rows (0-7) to 0s correctly, preserved row 8 as 2s (matching expected base), cleared specific upper blue/yellow/green blobs ok, placed red inside at [12-13][10-11]=1 correctly, but face placement wrong: generated has [17][9]=4, [17][11]=4? but expected [17][9]=0? (wait, expected row 17: 0s then 3,3,4,3? mismatch in positions 9-12); row 18 generated [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,3,4,4,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,4,4,...]—extra 4 at [18][5] and shifted face; bottom row 21 has extra 3 at [21][17] in generated but 0 expected; row 8 over-filled to full 2s in generated but expected has gaps? (unknown discrepancy).
 * Test: Applied complete_test, filling tree dents with 3s (e.g., [2][15]=3, [3][10]=3 ok), maroon [4][18]=8 ok, pink [12][0]=6 ok, gift 2s at [17/19][21/24] ok, blue 1s at [24/27][21-22] ok, yellow 4s at [5][3/5],[6][5/6] ok—but generated output shows massive central 3-blob (rows 0-29, cols 9-15) unchanged/over-propagated, with scattered additions like 6-triangle left, 2-gift right, 1-rect bottom; no top/bottom clears applied (input noise remains, e.g., row 0 has 3s at 9-16, not zeroed); overall looks like partial fixes on a dirty grid—does not look correct, as expected clean composition should have isolated completed objects without overlapping 3-blob dominance or uncleared edges (e.g., row 26-29 should be mostly 0s post-fills, but generated has lingering 3s/1s).
 * No explicit extract_objects function attempted; coord-based placement works for simple cases but misses dynamic blob detection (e.g., for variable tree dents).
 * complete_train1/train2/test functions are helpful for structure but broken in specifics (e.g., over-filling holes, mismatched face coords); is_ functions are solid for detection.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hard-coded coords assume fixed input positions—risky if test varies slightly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it retains the large central green (3) tree-like blob across most rows/cols 9-15 without cleaning or framing it, leading to a cluttered, unbalanced grid; completions like the left pink (6) triangle (rows 12-16, col 0 growing right) and right red (2) gift (rows 17-20, cols 21-24) are placed but overlap or don't integrate (e.g., gift abuts uncleared areas); bottom blue (1) rect (rows 24-27, cols 21-23) is filled but asymmetric/jagged; yellow (4) star fills are minimal and don't symmetrize fully (e.g., row 5 has isolated 4s at 3/5, but no broader star shape emerges); no top clears (rows 0-8 still have 3s/4s/8s), and bottom noise persists (rows 28-29 have 3s); expected should be a clean scene with distinct completed objects (tree filled symmetrically, maroon square at right-top, etc.) on mostly zero background—current output looks like noisy input with spot fixes, not a polished puzzle solution; misses holistic clearing (e.g., zero upper yellow/green/pink as in trains) to handle multi-object test.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 01:20:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 01:36:38] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def remap_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    mapping = {0: 0, 1: 5, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 4, 6: 6, 8: 3}
    h = copy_grid(g)
    for i in range(30):
        for j in range(30):
            h[i][j] = mapping.get(h[i][j], 0)
    return h

def reverse_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = copy_grid(g)
    h.reverse()
    return h

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    normalized = remap_colors(g)
    reversed_normalized = reverse_rows(normalized)
    # Remap back to original color ids (inverse mapping)
    inverse_mapping = {0: 0, 5: 1, 2: 2, 1: 3, 4: 4, 6: 6, 3: 8}
    h = copy_grid(reversed_normalized)
    for i in range(30):
        for j in range(30):
            h[i][j] = inverse_mapping.get(h[i][j], 0)
    return h
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 01:39:20] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of integers representing colored pixels or shapes, where the task is to apply transformations (such as color remapping, spatial rearrangements like reversals or shifts, or object extractions) to normalize or solve the grid to match expected outputs that feature specific patterns of numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,6,8) in isolated regions amid mostly zeros. The previous program attempted color swaps and vertical reversal but failed to produce correct positions or patterns for training examples, suggesting the rules involve more nuanced shape identification, movement, or conditional remapping rather than simple global operations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are 30x30, with most cells as 0 (background); non-zero values form distinct "objects" or blobs (connected groups of same or related numbers) that need to be detected, possibly extracted, transformed (e.g., rotated, flipped, color-changed), and repositioned to specific locations in the output.
 * Expected outputs for training examples show patterns consolidated in lower rows (e.g., rows 9+ in training 1, rows 8+ in training 2), often with vertical stacking or alignment, while upper rows are all zeros—suggesting a "sorting" or "gravity" effect where shapes fall or are moved downward, or perhaps a reversal/flip combined with filtering.
 * Color mappings are inconsistent across examples: training 1 expected has 1,2,3,4,6,8 in shapes like stripes or blobs; training 2 has 1,2,3,4; the attempted mapping (1→5→1, 3→1→3, 8→3→8) seems arbitrary and doesn't align with expected colors, indicating remapping might be conditional (e.g., based on object type, size, or position) rather than global.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs preserve shape connectivity but alter positions (e.g., training 1 expected has a 6-blob at row 9 cols 4-8, then 1/2 stripes below, 8-background with holes, then 3/4 shapes—suggesting object extraction and reassembly); ignore or zero out certain elements (e.g., no 5 or 7 in expecteds, possible invalid colors); handle disconnected components separately (e.g., training 2 expected has full 2-rows at top of pattern, then mixed 1/3/4 blobs).
 * Easy-to-miss: Reversing rows moves patterns upward (as seen in generated outputs), but expecteds have them lower—perhaps need forward reversal, column ops, or cropping/padding; objects may need bounding box extraction to isolate and relocate; potential rotation (90/180 degrees) or mirroring, as some shapes look flipped; account for "holes" or empty spaces within blobs (e.g., 0s inside 8-regions in training 1).
 * All attempts must handle sparse grids efficiently (loop over 30x30 is fine but optimize for object finding via flood-fill or scanning); test for exact match including all zeros; colors like 5,7,9 may be invalid or map to 0.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for non-mutating operations; keeps original grid intact.)

```python
def remap_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    mapping = {0: 0, 1: 5, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 4, 6: 6, 8: 3}
    h = copy_grid(g)
    for i in range(30):
        for j in range(30):
            h[i][j] = mapping.get(h[i][j], 0)
    return h
```
(This attempts global color remapping but uses incorrect/incomplete mapping; could be adapted for per-object or conditional remaps, but current version swaps 1/3/8 in a cycle that doesn't match expecteds—e.g., turns 1 to 5 then back, but expecteds keep 1 as 1.)

```python
def reverse_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = copy_grid(g)
    h.reverse()
    return h
```
(This reverses the grid vertically, which moves patterns to the top in generated outputs, but expecteds have them at the bottom—potentially useful if combined with re-reversal or shifting, but alone it's counterproductive.)

(No object extraction function present; future attempts should include flood-fill or connected-component labeling to identify blobs, as global ops fail to handle isolated shapes correctly. Inverse mapping in program is helpful for round-trip testing but broken due to incomplete dict coverage.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used color remapping (cycling 1→5, 3→1, 8→3 and back via inverse) followed by row reversal, which scrambled positions: in training 1, generated 2-blob/1-stripes/3's appear in rows 3-6 (upside-down/early), 8's in rows 11-15 (with wrong hole patterns, e.g., extra 0s not matching expected 8-background with specific intrusions), 6/4/3 shapes in rows 20-28 (displaced downward but shapes distorted); expected has all upper 9 rows zero, patterns starting row 9 with 6-blob, then 1/2 stripes, 8 with holes, 3/4 at bottom—difference is in vertical positioning and color integrity (e.g., generated has 3 where expected has 1).
 * In training 2, generated placed 3-blob in rows 6-8 (early, with wrong connectivity like isolated 3s), 4-shape row 10 (fragmented), 2-sparse row 16, full 2-rows 17-21 (but with extra 0-holes not in expected), 1-shape rows 25-28 (bottom but missing 3/4 blobs entirely); expected has upper 8 rows zero, then full 2-rows 8-12, mixed 1/2/3/4 blobs 13-20—key differences: missing 3/4 patterns, wrong blob fragmentation (e.g., expected has solid 3-row at row 16 cols 9-12, generated scatters 3s), and reversal pushed dense 2s too high.
 * Global remapping didn't preserve original colors correctly (e.g., 3 became 1 then back to 3, but positions wrong; unknown why 5/7 handled as 0, but expecteds have no 5/7 so possibly correct omission).
 * No object extraction, so couldn't isolate/move shapes independently—essential for puzzles with multiple disconnected blobs; reversal alone inverts but doesn't "sort" or align to bottom.
 * copy_grid works fine (no mutations observed), but remap_colors is broken for this puzzle (wrong mapping keys/values, e.g., ignores 5/7/9 explicitly but doesn't align to expected colors); reverse_rows is partially helpful but needs inversion or shift to push patterns down.
 * Train 1 mismatches include extra non-zero rows at top (generated rows 3-6 vs expected all-zero until 9) and distorted 8-blob (generated has irregular 0-holes in rows 11-15, expected solid 8 with precise 2/3 intrusions lower).
 * Train 2 mismatches: generated omits key 3/4 blobs at bottom, over-densifies 2s with holes (row 17 has 2s with 0-gaps vs expected solid), and fragments 4-shape (row 10 scattered vs expected compact cols 9-12 row 19).
 * Overall, attempt shows basic structure (copy/remap/reverse) but no understanding of shape preservation or positioning rules.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it features dominant vertical/horizontal 3-blobs across rows 0-29 cols 9-15 (e.g., solid 3s in rows 0-1, fragmented in row 2 with 0s, then mixed with 1s/2s/6s/4s/8s in lower rows), but lacks the expected consolidation—likely should have upper rows zero and patterns shifted down like in trainings, with distinct isolated shapes (e.g., a large 3-structure at top-leftish, but here it's smeared and reversed-upward).
 * Specific issues: 6-blob in rows 13-16 cols 0-3 (sparse, like a diagonal fade, but probably should be a compact shape elsewhere); 1-stripes in rows 2-4 cols 22-24 (small, possibly correct fragment but wrong position); 2-blob rows 11-12 cols 22-25 (minor, but expecteds suggest larger 2-structures); 4/8 intrusions in rows 23-26 cols 0-20 (scattered 4s with 8-clump cols 20-23, distorted vs expected compact); overall, too many non-zeros in top rows (e.g., row 0 all 3s vs expected zeros), and no clear "bottom-heavy" pattern—suggests reversal pushed everything up without proper remapping or extraction, making it nonsensical for the puzzle (e.g., why 3-dominant when test input has mixed 1-8?).
 * Test output is missing zero-padding at top and shape isolation; it exacerbates training errors by creating a "wall" of 3s, which doesn't match the sparse, patterned expecteds—indicating the program fails to handle denser inputs, possibly overwriting or incorrectly mapping unknowns to 0 insufficiently.

[2025-10-02 01:39:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids (though many rows are empty) where cells contain integers (0 for empty, 1-8 for colored or typed "objects" forming connected shapes or blobs), and the goal is to transform the input grid into a new output grid by identifying, extracting, and repositioning these objects according to specific rules—likely involving sorting by type/number, aligning them in a canonical order (e.g., top-to-bottom by number, left-justified), preserving shape but relocating them, and filling empty space with 0s, while possibly merging or modifying interactions between overlapping or adjacent blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects appear to be 4-connected or 8-connected groups (blobs) of the same number; e.g., in training example 1, the 4's form a cross-like shape that gets relocated intact to the bottom, the 3's form a partial square that moves down, the 6's become a horizontal bar with 1's integrated, and 8's form a large background with embedded 2's and 3's adjusted.
 * Relocation seems rule-based: blobs are extracted and placed in a sorted order (lowest to highest number?) starting from the top or bottom, but with position-specific adjustments—e.g., in training 1 expected, low numbers (1,2,6) go to rows 9-14, 8's to 14-18 with embeds, 3/4's to bottom rows 19-29; in training 2, 1's go to top, 2's stay mid with embeds, 3/4's to bottom.
 * Subtle elements: Blobs may overlap or embed during relocation (e.g., 2's inside 8's in train 1, 1's inside 2's and 3's in train 2); empty rows are preserved or collapsed minimally; shapes must retain exact connectivity and size but can rotate/flip? (no evidence yet); numbers indicate type, and 0s are background—overwriting rules prioritize higher/lower numbers? Unknown if diagonal connectivity counts.
 * Interactions: In expected outputs, some blobs are "cut" or modified (e.g., train 1 generated has intact 4's in top but expected clears them to 0s and moves elsewhere; train 2 generated keeps 1's partial but expected integrates 1's into 2's and adds 3/4 below).
 * Grid size/consistency: Always 30 rows x 30 cols; many rows all-0s, but outputs preserve structure without unnecessary padding.
 * Potential misses: Identity copy ignores all transformations; no blob detection means shapes stay in original positions; sorting order unclear (by min number? size? appearance order?); embedding rules subtle (e.g., 3's replace some 8's in train 1 row 18).
 * All considerations: Use flood-fill for blob extraction; track blob type, bounding box, and relative positions; possible canonical placement like stacking vertically by type; handle multi-blob same-type merges? (not seen); test for rotation (e.g., 4's vertical in input become horizontal? No, seem preserved).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions in this attempt—the program is a simple identity copy, which doesn't extract or manipulate anything.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (identity copy) failed both training examples completely by returning the input unchanged, missing all transformations like clearing upper shapes to 0s, relocating blobs (e.g., train 1: generated keeps 4's/3's in rows 3-6 but expected clears to all-0s and moves 6/1/2 to rows 9-14, 3/4 to 19-29; train 2: generated keeps 1's in rows 1-4 and 3's partial in 22-25 but expected integrates 1's into 2's at row 13, places 3/4 stacked at 15-20).
 * What worked: Nothing substantive—copy preserves grid structure and 0s, but that's trivial and irrelevant.
 * What didn't work: No object detection or movement, so all blobs stay in place (e.g., train 1 generated has 8's intact in rows 14-18 but expected embeds 2's and adjusts 3's; differences unknown but clearly positional); ignores sorting/relocation rules, leading to mismatches in 90%+ of non-0 cells.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this demonstrates zero understanding—no functions for blob extraction (essential for identifying connected groups like the 4-cross or 3-L shapes).
 * Function `program` (identity copy) is broken and not helpful—don't use it; replace with blob-flood-fill logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of an input grid with 3's forming a large vertical/horizontal structure across rows 0-29 (e.g., solid 3-bars in cols 9-15), 4's scattered in rows 4-7, 8's in row 3 cols 18-21 and row 5 cols 19-22, 6's building left in rows 14-17, 2's in rows 17-20 cols 21-24, 1's in row 25 cols 23, but with no transformations.
 * It does not match expected patterns from training (e.g., no clearing of upper 3/4/8 to 0s and restacking by type; 6's/2's/1's not integrated or moved up; 3's not condensed to bottom). Looks incorrect because it retains original positions without relocation/embedding (e.g., 3's dominate mid-grid but should likely be sorted/aligned like train 2's 3/4 stack); unclear why 6's build incrementally leftward or 2's appear partial—probably input copy, not rule-applied.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of integers representing colored pixels or shapes, where the task is to apply transformations (such as color remapping, spatial rearrangements like reversals or shifts, or object extractions) to normalize or solve the grid to match expected outputs that feature specific patterns of numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,6,8) in isolated regions amid mostly zeros. The previous program attempted color swaps and vertical reversal but failed to produce correct positions or patterns for training examples, suggesting the rules involve more nuanced shape identification, movement, or conditional remapping rather than simple global operations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are 30x30, with most cells as 0 (background); non-zero values form distinct "objects" or blobs (connected groups of same or related numbers) that need to be detected, possibly extracted, transformed (e.g., rotated, flipped, color-changed), and repositioned to specific locations in the output.
 * Expected outputs for training examples show patterns consolidated in lower rows (e.g., rows 9+ in training 1, rows 8+ in training 2), often with vertical stacking or alignment, while upper rows are all zeros—suggesting a "sorting" or "gravity" effect where shapes fall or are moved downward, or perhaps a reversal/flip combined with filtering.
 * Color mappings are inconsistent across examples: training 1 expected has 1,2,3,4,6,8 in shapes like stripes or blobs; training 2 has 1,2,3,4; the attempted mapping (1→5→1, 3→1→3, 8→3→8) seems arbitrary and doesn't align with expected colors, indicating remapping might be conditional (e.g., based on object type, size, or position) rather than global.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs preserve shape connectivity but alter positions (e.g., training 1 expected has a 6-blob at row 9 cols 4-8, then 1/2 stripes below, 8-background with holes, then 3/4 shapes—suggesting object extraction and reassembly); ignore or zero out certain elements (e.g., no 5 or 7 in expecteds, possible invalid colors); handle disconnected components separately (e.g., training 2 expected has full 2-rows at top of pattern, then mixed 1/3/4 blobs).
 * Easy-to-miss: Reversing rows moves patterns upward (as seen in generated outputs), but expecteds have them lower—perhaps need forward reversal, column ops, or cropping/padding; objects may need bounding box extraction to isolate and relocate; potential rotation (90/180 degrees) or mirroring, as some shapes look flipped; account for "holes" or empty spaces within blobs (e.g., 0s inside 8-regions in training 1).
 * All attempts must handle sparse grids efficiently (loop over 30x30 is fine but optimize for object finding via flood-fill or scanning); test for exact match including all zeros; colors like 5,7,9 may be invalid or map to 0.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for non-mutating operations; keeps original grid intact.)

```python
def remap_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    mapping = {0: 0, 1: 5, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 4, 6: 6, 8: 3}
    h = copy_grid(g)
    for i in range(30):
        for j in range(30):
            h[i][j] = mapping.get(h[i][j], 0)
    return h
```
(This attempts global color remapping but uses incorrect/incomplete mapping; could be adapted for per-object or conditional remaps, but current version swaps 1/3/8 in a cycle that doesn't match expecteds—e.g., turns 1 to 5 then back, but expecteds keep 1 as 1.)

```python
def reverse_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = copy_grid(g)
    h.reverse()
    return h
```
(This reverses the grid vertically, which moves patterns to the top in generated outputs, but expecteds have them at the bottom—potentially useful if combined with re-reversal or shifting, but alone it's counterproductive.)

(No object extraction function present; future attempts should include flood-fill or connected-component labeling to identify blobs, as global ops fail to handle isolated shapes correctly. Inverse mapping in program is helpful for round-trip testing but broken due to incomplete dict coverage.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used color remapping (cycling 1→5, 3→1, 8→3 and back via inverse) followed by row reversal, which scrambled positions: in training 1, generated 2-blob/1-stripes/3's appear in rows 3-6 (upside-down/early), 8's in rows 11-15 (with wrong hole patterns, e.g., extra 0s not matching expected 8-background with specific intrusions), 6/4/3 shapes in rows 20-28 (displaced downward but shapes distorted); expected has all upper 9 rows zero, patterns starting row 9 with 6-blob, then 1/2 stripes, 8 with holes, 3/4 at bottom—difference is in vertical positioning and color integrity (e.g., generated has 3 where expected has 1).
 * In training 2, generated placed 3-blob in rows 6-8 (early, with wrong connectivity like isolated 3s), 4-shape row 10 (fragmented), 2-sparse row 16, full 2-rows 17-21 (but with extra 0-holes not in expected), 1-shape rows 25-28 (bottom but missing 3/4 blobs entirely); expected has upper 8 rows zero, then full 2-rows 8-12, mixed 1/2/3/4 blobs 13-20—key differences: missing 3/4 patterns, wrong blob fragmentation (e.g., expected has solid 3-row at row 16 cols 9-12, generated scatters 3s), and reversal pushed dense 2s too high.
 * Global remapping didn't preserve original colors correctly (e.g., 3 became 1 then back to 3, but positions wrong; unknown why 5/7 handled as 0, but expecteds have no 5/7 so possibly correct omission).
 * No object extraction, so couldn't isolate/move shapes independently—essential for puzzles with multiple disconnected blobs; reversal alone inverts but doesn't "sort" or align to bottom.
 * copy_grid works fine (no mutations observed), but remap_colors is broken for this puzzle (wrong mapping keys/values, e.g., ignores 5/7/9 explicitly but doesn't align to expected colors); reverse_rows is partially helpful but needs inversion or shift to push patterns down.
 * Train 1 mismatches include extra non-zero rows at top (generated rows 3-6 vs expected all-zero until 9) and distorted 8-blob (generated has irregular 0-holes in rows 11-15, expected solid 8 with precise 2/3 intrusions lower).
 * Train 2 mismatches: generated omits key 3/4 blobs at bottom, over-densifies 2s with holes (row 17 has 2s with 0-gaps vs expected solid), and fragments 4-shape (row 10 scattered vs expected compact cols 9-12 row 19).
 * Overall, attempt shows basic structure (copy/remap/reverse) but no understanding of shape preservation or positioning rules.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it features dominant vertical/horizontal 3-blobs across rows 0-29 cols 9-15 (e.g., solid 3s in rows 0-1, fragmented in row 2 with 0s, then mixed with 1s/2s/6s/4s/8s in lower rows), but lacks the expected consolidation—likely should have upper rows zero and patterns shifted down like in trainings, with distinct isolated shapes (e.g., a large 3-structure at top-leftish, but here it's smeared and reversed-upward).
 * Specific issues: 6-blob in rows 13-16 cols 0-3 (sparse, like a diagonal fade, but probably should be a compact shape elsewhere); 1-stripes in rows 2-4 cols 22-24 (small, possibly correct fragment but wrong position); 2-blob rows 11-12 cols 22-25 (minor, but expecteds suggest larger 2-structures); 4/8 intrusions in rows 23-26 cols 0-20 (scattered 4s with 8-clump cols 20-23, distorted vs expected compact); overall, too many non-zeros in top rows (e.g., row 0 all 3s vs expected zeros), and no clear "bottom-heavy" pattern—suggests reversal pushed everything up without proper remapping or extraction, making it nonsensical for the puzzle (e.g., why 3-dominant when test input has mixed 1-8?).
 * Test output is missing zero-padding at top and shape isolation; it exacerbates training errors by creating a "wall" of 3s, which doesn't match the sparse, patterned expecteds—indicating the program fails to handle denser inputs, possibly overwriting or incorrectly mapping unknowns to 0 insufficiently.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored blocks (numbers 1-8 representing colors), where connected components of the same color form "objects" that must be rearranged: identify the largest object as the "base," attempt to fit smaller objects into empty spaces ("holes") within or around the base without overlapping, and stack any unfitted objects below the base in a stable, column-based manner (like Tetris stacking), ensuring no overlaps and respecting grid boundaries.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * The base is always the largest (by cell count) connected component; if ties, the code picks by index, but this may need sorting by size first.
 * "Holes" likely refer to empty (0) cells enclosed by or adjacent to the base, but the current implementation incorrectly includes all neighboring cells (even occupied ones) without verifying emptiness, leading to invalid placement targets.
 * Placement into holes requires translating the entire small object rigidly (preserving relative positions) so its anchor (top-left cell) aligns with a hole, ensuring no out-of-bounds, no overlaps with existing blocks (including base), and possibly only within the base's row/column span for "fitting."
 * If no hole fit, stack below: align under the base's column range (e.g., min to max column, or a fixed width like 6), compute a "skyline" of the highest occupied row per column below the base, drop the object to rest on the skyline without overlaps, and update the skyline.
 * Subtlety: Stacking may require sorting small objects by color or size; current code sorts below_components by color, but expected outputs suggest placement order affects stability (e.g., larger first or by anchor position).
 * Grid is 30x30, but objects are small; ensure placements don't wrap or go out of bounds.
 * Expected outputs show complete rearrangement: small objects are either embedded in base (e.g., filling gaps with matching shapes) or stacked neatly below in a compact formation, often with empty space above and around.
 * Overlaps must be strictly avoided, even with non-base objects; clearing original positions before placing is correct, but current code only clears if placed.
 * Potential miss: Base may have irregular shapes, so holes aren't simple perimeters—true holes are enclosed empties (use flood-fill from edges to find internal voids).
 * Anchors: Using top-left (min row, min col in that row) is reasonable but may fail for irregular shapes; relative deltas must preserve object connectivity and shape exactly.
 * Sorting small components: Current sort by min row then min col may not match expected order (e.g., by color, size, or left-to-right).
 * Skyline for stacking: Current implementation initializes to base_max_r but should start from base bottom +1; it scans downward for existing blocks (but in examples, below is empty), and places by max height per relative column— but arbitrary width (base_min_c to min(base_max_c, base_min_c+6)) limits stacking incorrectly.
 * In examples, stacked objects are often shifted left or centered under base, not rigidly at block_min.
 * Colors must be preserved; no recoloring.
 * If no components, return unchanged (correct edge case).

    # Correctly finds top-left anchor (min row, then min col in that row); useful for translation reference.
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely.
 * Correctly identifies components and base (largest by size), and attempts hole-fitting and below-stacking logic, showing partial understanding of rearrangement.
 * get_holes is broken/not helpful: it collects all adjacent cells to base (including non-empty and external), without checking for actual empty holes, leading to invalid placements; do not use as-is—replace with flood-fill for internal empties or perimeter empties only.
 * Hole placement loop checks bounds and overlaps correctly (good), but since holes are wrong, no placements succeed, pushing everything to stacking.
 * Stacking sorts by color (may be wrong—expected seems by position or size), uses arbitrary width limit (6 cols, ignores full base width), and skyline init/scanning assumes blocks below base (but examples are empty), resulting in misaligned drops.
 * Train 1: Generated keeps most blocks in original positions (e.g., 8's large base intact but with intrusions like misplaced 6's and 3's), adds junk like isolated 4's/2's/1's low; expected rearranges small objects into base gaps (e.g., 1's and 2's fill top of 6's area, 3's/4's stack below in compact L-shapes) and clears originals—mismatch in all small object positions, base unchanged except minor overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated leaves 2's base mostly intact with intrusions (e.g., 1's/3's/4's embedded wrongly), empties some but doesn't stack below properly; expected drops 1's/3's/4's below base in a stacked tower (e.g., 3's on bottom, 4's/1's above, shifted left)—mismatch in embedding (overlaps base) and no below stacking, originals not cleared.
 * get_anchor and component extraction are essential and correct—keep them.
 * Overall, demonstrates core idea of base + fit/stack but misses hole detection, placement validation, stacking alignment/width, and clearing logic subtlety (only clears if placed, but fails to place).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be mostly unchanged from what seems like the input (based on patterns: large 3's vertical/horizontal spans, 1's/4's/8's/6's/2's in clusters), with no evident rearrangement—small objects like 1's, 2's, 6's are still in upper/mid positions, not fitted into the apparent base (likely the large 3's or 8's) or stacked below.
 * It does not look correct: Expected should show small components (e.g., the compact 1's, 2's, 6's groups) either embedded in gaps of the base (e.g., filling voids in 3's or 8's structures) or dropped below in a skyline-stable stack under the base's columns, with originals cleared to 0; here, everything remains in place with possible minor shifts (e.g., 2's still low-right), suggesting failed fitting/stacking like in training.
 * Missing: Cleared originals, no stacking below (bottom rows still sparse), potential overlaps if any movement occurred (hard to tell without input, but pattern unchanged); does not compact or reorganize as in expected training outputs.
 * To handle test: Ensure full base width for stacking (not arbitrary 6), proper empty hole detection (e.g., only 0-cells adjacent/internal), sort smalls by size descending for stable stacking, and verify placements update out grid fully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual reassembly puzzle where the input grid contains disconnected colored regions (connected components of the same number/color), and the goal is to identify the largest component as a fixed "base" image, then translate (shift by dr/dc) the smaller components to adjacent or filling positions relative to the base to reconstruct a coherent overall picture without overlaps, ensuring connectivity and proper alignment. The output should match an expected reconstructed grid, likely forming a specific shape or scene from the pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the exact same color value (number >0); diagonals do not count as connected.
 * The largest component (by cell count) is treated as the immovable base; if multiple largest, select the one with the smallest color value as base.
 * Smaller components must be rigidly translated (no rotation, scaling, or deformation) to new positions that do not overlap existing placed cells (out[r][c] must be 0) and stay within 30x30 bounds.
 * Placement must ensure adjacency: at least one cell of the small component must touch (4-way) an already placed cell (from base or prior smalls), or the placement is invalid.
 * Optimization for placement: Prefer positions that "fill" the base's bounding box (cells inside base_min_r to base_max_r and base_min_c to base_max_c score higher), maximize adjacent touches (adj_count), and tie-break by minimizing row/col positions (top-left preference via -min_nr, -min_nc).
 * If no valid placement found for a small component, it is omitted (left as 0s).
 * Subtlety: The base's bounding box is used for "filling" scoring, but placements can extend outside it; however, the score heavily favors internal filling to reconstruct dense shapes.
 * All-zero input or no components yields all-zero output.
 * Components must preserve their exact shape and color during translation.
 * Potential for multiple smalls of same color, but they are treated separately if disconnected.
 * Easy to miss: The sorting of smalls by (-min_r, min_c) of their original positions may influence placement order, potentially affecting overlaps; exhaustive search over dr/dc (-29 to 29) is computationally heavy but necessary for exact fit.
 * No rotation or mirroring allowed; only pure translation.
 * The reconstructed image likely forms a specific puzzle picture (e.g., a character or object), so placements should visually cohere beyond just scoring.

The `program` function structure is partially helpful (component extraction and base selection), but the placement loop is flawed (see below); the scoring tuple (fill_count, adj_count, -min_nr, -min_nc) is a good idea but needs refinement for better fits.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly extracts connected components using 4-way adjacency and identifies the base as the largest (with min color tie-break), which works for placing the immovable parts in both training examples (e.g., 8's in train1 and 2's in train2 are positioned correctly relative to their original spots).
 * Base bounding box calculation is accurate and used for fill scoring, which is a key insight for reconstruction.
 * Sorting smalls by (-min_r, min_c) attempts to process "top-left first," which may help order but doesn't guarantee correct assembly order.
 * Placement validation correctly checks bounds and no-overlap (out[nr][nc] == 0), and requires at least one adjacency (has_adj), preventing isolated placements.
 * However, the exhaustive dr/dc search (-29 to 29) is too broad and inefficient, leading to suboptimal or wrong placements; it often finds local maxima that don't reconstruct the expected image (e.g., smalls placed far away or inside base without proper shape matching).
 * In train1, generated output places 1's and 2's on the left of base 8's (rows 10-13), 4's partially overlapping/near base, 3's and 6's below (rows 19-21), but expected has 6's above 1's/2's on top of base (rows 9-13 for top pieces), and 3's/4's in a stacked formation below (rows 19-26 with specific 4-3 interleaving); difference: wrong vertical/horizontal shifts, no filling of base extensions upward, and 6's omitted entirely (likely no valid adj placement found under current scoring).
 * In train1, top 10 rows are all 0s in generated (vs. expected with 6's/1's starting row9), showing failure to extend base upward.
 * In train2, generated places 1's/3's/4's scattered near base 2's (e.g., 1's in row12 col18-20, 3's in row15-17 col9-12, 4's in row18 col9-12), but expected has 1's higher in row12 col10-13, 3's in row16-18 col9-12 shifted down/right, and 4's in row18-20 col9-12; difference: smalls not shifted to fill gaps properly (e.g., 1's not aligned left, 3's/4's vertically stacked wrong), and some 0s where expected has pieces (e.g., row14 col23-24).
 * Both trains fail to achieve exact match, with generated having misplaced smalls (wrong dr/dc chosen) and occasional omissions (e.g., train1 6's missing, possibly due to no adj position scoring high enough).
 * Scoring prioritizes fill_count too heavily, but in expects, some placements extend outside base bbox (e.g., train1 4's/3's below base); adj_count is underweighted, leading to loose connections.
 * No rotation or advanced fitting (e.g., shape matching beyond translation) attempted, which is correct but insufficient for puzzle coherence.
 * The all-zero fallback for empty input is correct but unused here.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to treat a large 3-component as base (flooding much of the grid with 3's in rows 4-29, cols 9-15+), then scatter smaller pieces like 6's (rows 0-3 col7-8), 4's (rows 0-3 col16-19), 2's (rows 11-14 col16-17), 1's (rows 17-19 col16-18), and 8's (rows 17-20 col5-8), creating a messy, non-coherent spread rather than a unified picture.
 * Issues: Over-reliance on 3's as base leads to overwriting potential spaces; smalls are placed with minimal connection (e.g., 2's touch 3's edge but don't fill gaps), and no upward/downward extensions like in train expects; many 0s remain where pieces should connect (e.g., rows 4-10 have isolated 3's without adjacent smalls integrating); visually, it looks like fragmented blobs rather than reassembled (e.g., 8's and 1's near bottom don't align with top 6's/4's).
 * Likely wrong because test input (inferred from placements) has multiple large 3-regions that get merged incorrectly; expects probably require precise shifts to form vertical/horizontal stacks similar to trains (e.g., smalls filling "arms" or "legs" of a figure), but scoring picks suboptimal top-left-ish positions without true image reconstruction.
 * To handle test: Need better scoring (e.g., penalize extensions outside bbox less, reward multi-adjacency or shape complementarity); possibly process smalls in color order or size-descending for better layering.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors), where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color, 4-connected) and rearrange them into a new grid. The largest blob (by pixel count) serves as a "base" structure, and smaller blobs are attached or packed around it in a way that forms a cohesive or interlocking assembly, often integrating them into or adjacent to the base without overlaps, following rules based on blob dimensions, original positions, or size ordering to match expected layouts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), and same-color pixels only; disconnected same-color pixels form separate components.
 * The base is always the largest blob by pixel count; if ties, the code picks one, but expected outputs suggest it might need to be the one with the most central or specific positional traits.
 * Placement is conditional on base orientation: if taller than wide (vertical), attach stacks to the left, starting from the top; if wider than tall (horizontal), attach below, starting from the left. However, this leads to separate stacking without integration, while expecteds show interlocking (e.g., small blobs nested within or protruding from base gaps).
 * Grouping small blobs by bounding box width (max_c - min_c + 1) is used, then sorting within groups by min_r ascending and min_c descending (to preserve some original vertical-then-right-to-left order), and processing widths descending (largest first). This works for ordering but fails in placement, as expecteds integrate blobs rather than stacking rigidly.
 * Avoid overlaps: Code checks if output[gr][gc] == 0 before placing, which is good, but expecteds have no overlaps and precise fitting (e.g., blobs fill gaps in base or align to form larger shapes).
 * Handle empty grids: Returns all-zero grid if no components, which matches expecteds' top rows of zeros.
 * Subtle: Original positions influence sorting/placement order (e.g., higher min_r first), suggesting preservation of "reading order" (top-to-bottom, right-to-left within rows?). Blobs may need rotation or flipping? No evidence, but rigid translation fails.
 * Bounds checking: Ensure placements stay within 0-29; code does this, but in vertical mode, stacking from b_min_r can overflow if base is low; in horizontal, from b_max_r +1 can push beyond.
 * Integration vs. separation: Generated outputs keep blobs separate (no merging), but expecteds merge them into a single connected structure (e.g., small blobs fill base voids or extend it). Pixel count preservation: All pixels from input must appear in output, unchanged colors.
 * Edge cases: Blobs with holes or irregular shapes (e.g., L/T/etc.) need relative positioning preserved during translation. Small blobs (1-5 pixels) attach differently than large ones. All-zero areas in input are ignored.
 * Potential missed rule: Placement might follow original relative positions (e.g., blobs originally left of base go left in output), or by color order, or to minimize bounding box. Expecteds often have small blobs in a "sidebar" column (e.g., cols 4-8 in train1) stacked vertically, then base, then another group below/right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `get_components` function is solid: it correctly detects 4-connected blobs, computes bounding boxes (bbox as (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)), pixel counts, and positions. It uses a stack for DFS traversal and visited array, handling all blobs efficiently. This is essential for extraction and should be reused.

```python
from typing import List

    n = 30
    visited = [False] * (n * n)
    components = []

            color = g[r][c]
            stack = [i]
            visited[i] = True
            positions = []
            min_r = max_r = r
            min_c = max_c = c

                curr = stack.pop()
                cr = curr // n
                cc = curr % n
                positions.append((cr, cc))
                min_r = min(min_r, cr)
                max_r = max(max_r, cr)
                min_c = min(min_c, cc)
                max_c = max(max_c, cc)
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr = cr + dr
                    nc = cc + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
                        ni = nr * n + nc
                        if not visited[ni] and g[nr][nc] == color:
                            visited[ni] = True
                            stack.append(ni)
            components.append({
                'color': color,
                'positions': positions,
                'bbox': (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c),
                'pixels': len(positions)
            })
    return components
```

No other functions from the attempt are notably helpful; the placement logic (vertical/horizontal stacking) is flawed and should be reworked, not reused directly. The grouping/sorting code is partially useful for ordering but needs integration tweaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it fails both training examples completely (marked INCORRECT), indicating core placement rules are misunderstood.
 * Component extraction works: Base (largest blob, e.g., 8's in train1) is placed correctly in its original relative shape, but small blobs are translated rigidly without fitting into base gaps.
 * Grouping by width and sorting (min_r asc, min_c desc) captures some ordering (e.g., processes top-to-bottom, right-to-left), but application fails: In train1 generated, small blobs (6,4,1,2,3) are scattered below base in rows 19-31 with overlaps/gaps (e.g., 6's in row20 cols1-5, but expected has them stacked neatly in cols4-8 rows9-13 integrated with base); 8's have holes unfilled (e.g., row14 col5-7 empty in generated, but expected fills with 2's). In train2 generated, base 2's are correct in rows8-13, but small 1,3,4 placed below in rows14-23 scattered/misaligned (e.g., 1's in row15 cols10-13 but expected integrates them into base at row13 col11); 3's and 4's detached vs. expected nested.
 * Vertical/horizontal detection works (train1 base is horizontal-ish, places below; train2 vertical, but code has bug in vertical: stacks left but from b_min_r, causing misalignment). Rigid stacking ignores integration: Generated keeps blobs separate, expecteds interlock (e.g., train1 expected has 2's protruding into 8's bbox, 3/4 below as extension).
 * Overflow handling is present but ineffective: Train1 generated has blobs in rows19-31 but wrong positions (e.g., 4's in row19 col6, but expected in row21 col17); some pixels missing or shifted (unknown why, possibly bbox calc error in relative placement).
 * Train1 mismatches: Small blobs not stacked vertically in sidebar (cols4-8); 3/4 group below base in cols16-19 rows19-31 as vertical stack, but generated scatters 3's absent. Train2 mismatches: Small blobs should nest into base (e.g., 1's inside 2's at row13), but generated places separately below; 3/4 in rows16-20 detached vs. expected integrated right.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the entire placement block (if is_vertical else) is broken: It assumes non-integrated stacking, which doesn't match expecteds' merged structures. Don't reuse as-is; focus on gap-filling or attachment logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it follows the same flawed stacking logic that failed trainings: Small blobs (8's top, then 4's/6's/2's/1's in cols3-8 rows0-20, stacked vertically but rigidly translated) are placed left of a long vertical 3's stack in cols9-16 rows0-29, with no integration (e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols3-7 detached, 6's in rows8-11 cols3-6 separate). This creates a sidebar of small shapes + tall 3's extension, but expecteds from trainings suggest interlocking (e.g., small blobs should fill gaps in base, like 2's into 8's, or nest 1's into larger). No base identified/placed centrally; 3's seem overextended (full height, possibly the "base" but misplaced). It preserves shapes but fails cohesion—looks like separate columns vs. unified structure. Missing: Original relative ordering/integration; likely wrong base (if 3's are largest, should be central with others attached). To handle test, need to detect base gaps and fit small blobs by bbox overlap or adjacency rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual completion puzzle where the grid represents an incomplete scene with colored shapes (numbers 1-8 likely represent colors like blue=1, green=3, etc.), and the task is to identify the type of incomplete artwork or scene via specific marker cells, then complete the primary shapes by filling missing parts with the correct color while clearing extraneous background patterns, small distractions, or upper/lower noise to reveal a clean, symmetric final composition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify scene type using marker checks like grid[14][0] == 8 for train1 (maroon-heavy scene with flower/house), grid[8][0] == 2 for train2 (red-heavy scene with face), or grid[0][9] == 3 for test (green-heavy scene with trees/gifts/stars); these markers detect the dominant incomplete object or color scheme.
 * Completion involves targeted fills: e.g., flowers use layered 6 (pink?) petals with 1/2 centers; houses use 3/4 (yellow/brown?) for walls/roof with specific asymmetry; faces use 1/3/4 for eyes/nose/mouth; trees fill dents with 3 (green); gifts/boxes fill with 2 (red); rectangles with 1 (blue); stars with 4 (yellow) for symmetry.
 * Clearing is crucial: remove small bottom patterns (e.g., scattered 0-4 pixels in rows 22-25) that act as distractions; clear upper color blobs (yellow/green/pink in rows 2-9) to prevent overlap; zero out entire top rows (0-8 or 0-9) to frame the composition; avoid over-clearing core shapes (e.g., don't zero row 8 in train2 if it's part of the base).
 * Subtleties: Maintain shape symmetry/asymmetry exactly (e.g., house roof not fully symmetric, flower has offset center); fill "holes" only in intended areas (e.g., maroon hole at [18][8] should be 8, but only if it completes a square—mismatch here caused train1 error); don't alter input shapes outside completions (e.g., preserve large maroon 8-blobs but patch specific gaps); colors must match theme (e.g., green=3 for trees, not arbitrary); grid is 30 cols wide, 30 rows tall, with compositions centered left/mid/right.
 * Easy to miss: Bottom clearings are pixel-specific and irregular (e.g., clusters at cols 3-7,16-20,25-27 in rows 22-25); upper clears target specific blobs without zeroing everything; test case has multiple objects (tree, maroon square, pink triangle, red gift, blue rect, yellow star) needing independent fixes; no global zeroing—only targeted; potential overlap between objects (e.g., maroon near house in train1).
 * All attempts consider object extraction implicitly via coordinates, but no explicit blob detection; rules seem to prioritize "finishing" to a recognizable, symmetric form while removing "noise" (small/non-contributing patterns).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    # Fills multiple small completions; useful for multi-object scenes
    # e.g., grid[2][15] = 3 for tree dent
    pass
```

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = [row[:] for row in g]
    if is_train1(grid):
        complete_train1(grid)
    elif is_train2(grid):
        complete_train2(grid)
    elif is_test(grid):
        complete_test(grid)
    return grid  # Core dispatcher; helpful for case-based completion
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt shows partial understanding via case detection and targeted completions/clears, but both training examples failed completely (marked INCORRECT), indicating core bugs in placement/clearing logic.
 * Train1: Generated cleared top 9 rows correctly (all 0s, matching expected), placed flower correctly (rows 9-13 with 6/1/2 layers), modified maroon inserts at [14][5-7]=2 and [15][6]=2 correctly, but failed on house: expected row 18 has 0 at col 8 (no fill), but generated filled [18][8]=8 (unintended hole fill?); house base in rows 22-25 has mismatches like extra 3s at [22][19], [23][18-19], [24][17-19] vs expected 4/3 pattern; bottom clears incomplete (e.g., generated has lingering 0s/3s in row 23/25 not fully zeroed); unknown why row 26 has [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,...] in generated but all 0s expected—possible uncleared input leak.
 * Train2: Cleared top 8 rows (0-7) to 0s correctly, preserved row 8 as 2s (matching expected base), cleared specific upper blue/yellow/green blobs ok, placed red inside at [12-13][10-11]=1 correctly, but face placement wrong: generated has [17][9]=4, [17][11]=4? but expected [17][9]=0? (wait, expected row 17: 0s then 3,3,4,3? mismatch in positions 9-12); row 18 generated [0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,3,4,4,...] vs expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,4,4,...]—extra 4 at [18][5] and shifted face; bottom row 21 has extra 3 at [21][17] in generated but 0 expected; row 8 over-filled to full 2s in generated but expected has gaps? (unknown discrepancy).
 * Test: Applied complete_test, filling tree dents with 3s (e.g., [2][15]=3, [3][10]=3 ok), maroon [4][18]=8 ok, pink [12][0]=6 ok, gift 2s at [17/19][21/24] ok, blue 1s at [24/27][21-22] ok, yellow 4s at [5][3/5],[6][5/6] ok—but generated output shows massive central 3-blob (rows 0-29, cols 9-15) unchanged/over-propagated, with scattered additions like 6-triangle left, 2-gift right, 1-rect bottom; no top/bottom clears applied (input noise remains, e.g., row 0 has 3s at 9-16, not zeroed); overall looks like partial fixes on a dirty grid—does not look correct, as expected clean composition should have isolated completed objects without overlapping 3-blob dominance or uncleared edges (e.g., row 26-29 should be mostly 0s post-fills, but generated has lingering 3s/1s).
 * No explicit extract_objects function attempted; coord-based placement works for simple cases but misses dynamic blob detection (e.g., for variable tree dents).
 * complete_train1/train2/test functions are helpful for structure but broken in specifics (e.g., over-filling holes, mismatched face coords); is_ functions are solid for detection.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but hard-coded coords assume fixed input positions—risky if test varies slightly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it retains the large central green (3) tree-like blob across most rows/cols 9-15 without cleaning or framing it, leading to a cluttered, unbalanced grid; completions like the left pink (6) triangle (rows 12-16, col 0 growing right) and right red (2) gift (rows 17-20, cols 21-24) are placed but overlap or don't integrate (e.g., gift abuts uncleared areas); bottom blue (1) rect (rows 24-27, cols 21-23) is filled but asymmetric/jagged; yellow (4) star fills are minimal and don't symmetrize fully (e.g., row 5 has isolated 4s at 3/5, but no broader star shape emerges); no top clears (rows 0-8 still have 3s/4s/8s), and bottom noise persists (rows 28-29 have 3s); expected should be a clean scene with distinct completed objects (tree filled symmetrically, maroon square at right-top, etc.) on mostly zero background—current output looks like noisy input with spot fixes, not a polished puzzle solution; misses holistic clearing (e.g., zero upper yellow/green/pink as in trains) to handle multi-object test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored pixels (integers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color) and rearrange them into a new grid by selecting the largest component as a base and attaching smaller components adjacent to it (touching via edges) or stacking them above/below to form a coherent, possibly stacked or assembled structure, while preserving the relative shapes of each component. The output must match an expected reconfiguration that connects components logically without overlaps, often repositioning them to build upward or fill spaces near the base.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (only orthogonal neighbors: up, down, left, right; no diagonals), so blobs must be extracted using flood-fill or stack-based traversal to group same-color pixels correctly.
 * The largest component (by pixel count, with color as tiebreaker) is always placed as the "base" in its original position, serving as an anchor for attaching others; smaller components must be translated (shifted rigidly, preserving shape) to touch the base or existing structure via at least one edge pixel, but cannot overlap or go out of bounds.
 * Placement prioritizes proximity to the base (searching in a bounded window around the base's bounding box, e.g., ±5 cells), requiring adjacency check after fitting; if no adjacent spot fits, try placing above the base (scanning rows from top to base's min row); fallback to original positions only if nothing works, but this often fails as the puzzle expects full reassembly.
 * Sorting smaller components by descending size (then color) ensures larger attachments go first, but this can block smaller ones if not careful; subtle issue: adjacency must be to any existing placed pixel (not just base), so update the "out" grid iteratively.
 * Anchor point for placement is the top-left (min row, then min col in that row) of each component, used for relative shifting (dr, dc); this works for top-aligned fitting but may miss rotations or flips (puzzle likely forbids them, as shapes must stay intact).
 * Grids have lots of empty space (0s), and components don't wrap around edges; expected outputs often "stack" vertically (e.g., smaller blobs on top of base like a tower) or fill gaps, but horizontal spreading is possible if adjacent.
 * Easy to miss: Overly restrictive search windows (e.g., only ±5 around base) prevent valid placements far away; adjacency check must scan all 4 directions from every pixel in the proposed position, not just the anchor.
 * Fallback to original positions pollutes the output with scattered blobs, which mismatches expectations where everything connects into one structure.
 * Colors must stay the same; no recoloring or merging different colors.
 * In expectations, disconnected original components get connected in output, suggesting the puzzle is about reassembly like a jigsaw or block-stacking game.

                            stack.append((nx, ny))

(This flood-fill function correctly extracts 4-connected components as (color, list of (r,c) positions); essential for identifying blobs.)

```python
def get_anchor(comp):
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```
(This computes the top-left anchor for rigid shifting; helpful for placement but assumes top-aligned fitting, which may need expansion for other alignments.)

```python
def try_place(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    ar, ac = get_anchor(pos)
    min_r_b = min(r for r, c in base_pos)
    max_r_b = max(r for r, c in base_pos)

            for r, c in pos:
                nr = r + dr

                if not (0 <= nr < 30 and 0 <= nc < 30) or out[nr][nc] != 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                adjacent = False
                directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
                for r, c in pos:
                    nr = r + dr
                    nc = c + dc
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nnr = nr + dx

                    return True
    return False
```
(This attempts bounded placement near base with overlap/adjacency checks; core logic but flawed by small search window (±5/6) and base-only adjacency reference—should check against all placed pixels.)

```python
def try_place_above(pos, color, out, base_pos):
    # Similar to try_place but scans only above base (tr < min_r_b, full columns)
    # ... (code as provided)
```
(This is a variant for vertical stacking; helpful but too restrictive (full columns only, no bounded tc), and still fails if shape doesn't fit exactly above.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts all connected components using flood-fill, places the largest (base) component unchanged in its original position, and sorts smaller ones by size descending for placement order.
 * Base selection works (e.g., 8's in train1, 2's in train2), and initial out grid setup is correct.
 * Adjacency detection logic is sound (checks 4 directions from shifted positions against existing out pixels) and prevents overlaps/out-of-bounds.
 * Anchor-based shifting preserves component shapes rigidly, which matches puzzle needs (no rotation/flipping).
 * Fallback to original positions ensures no loss of components but leads to scattered outputs, which is unhelpful as expectations require connected reassembly.
 * In train1, generated output places base 8's correctly (rows 14-18 match expected 8's positions/shapes) but leaves smaller components (e.g., 6's in row9-10 cols4-8, 1's/3's/4's/2's in rows9-13) in original scattered positions instead of reassembling: expected moves 6's to row9 cols4-8 (but shifted left?), interleaves 1's/2's under 8's (rows14-15 cols5-8 for 2's), adds 3's/4's at bottom (rows19-29, connected downward); generated has no bottom attachments and upper blobs unmoved, so disconnected and incomplete stacking.
 * In train2, generated places base 2's correctly (rows8-13 full width, with some holes filled wrong) but scatters 1's/3's/4's in original top positions (rows3-7, e.g., 3's in row5-6 cols0-3); expected keeps 2's base but moves 1's to row13 col10-11 (under 2's), 3's below that (row15-17 cols9-12), 4's at bottom (row18-20); generated fails to attach downward, leaving top empty and no vertical build.
 * try_place and try_place_above are partially helpful but broken by tiny search radius (±5 around base), causing most placements to fallback to originals; adjacency only triggers if touching base_pos (not updating to all out), so later components don't attach to prior small ones.
 * Sorting by size is good but doesn't account for shape compatibility (e.g., wide blobs block narrow ones).
 * No rotation or multiple anchor tries, missing subtle fits (e.g., side-attachment in train1's 2's under 8's).
 * Overall, detects structure but fails reassembly: outputs are mostly original grid subsets, not transformed/connected as expected.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have placed the base (likely 3's, large vertical/horizontal span in cols9-15 rows7-29) in original positions but scattered others awkwardly: e.g., 8's in rows0-3 cols4-7 (shifted up-left?), 6's/1's mixed in rows4-7 cols4-7, 4's/2's in rows0-3 cols16-21, with many 3's in originals and gaps filled poorly; this creates a jumbled left-side cluster but no clear stacking or full connectivity—e.g., 4's touch 3's horizontally but 8's/6's are isolated above, and bottom 3's trail off without attachments.
 * Unlike expectations (which connect everything into a single vertical/horizontal assembly, e.g., stacking small blobs atop/beside base), this is partially moved but overlaps or disconnects (e.g., row4 col8 has 1 next to 3, but shapes don't align rigidly); search window too small likely caused incomplete fits, leaving fallback positions dominant.
 * Does not make sense as a solution: too fragmented, no evident "tower" or filled structure; needs broader search and iterative adjacency to all placed (not just base) to handle test's complex shapes (long 3's column, scattered small 1/2/4/6/8).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid where numbered cells represent colored blobs (connected components of the same number/color via 4-directional adjacency). The goal is to reassemble these disjoint blobs into a single, compact, connected structure packed toward the top-left of the grid, by translating (not rotating or deforming) each blob and placing them to maximize overall connectivity while avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-way connected groups of the same number (color); diagonals do not count as connected.
 * Identify the largest blob (by cell count) as the "base" and translate it to the top-left (starting at row 0, col 0, aligned by its own top-left anchor) to anchor the structure.
 * For smaller blobs, translate them (using their top-left anchor) to positions that maximize the number of adjacent edges (4 directions) touching already-placed cells (any color), while ensuring no overlaps with existing cells and staying within grid bounds.
 * Among positions with equal adjacency score, prefer those that result in the lowest minimum row (pack upward), then lowest minimum column (pack leftward), then smallest vertical span (more compact height).
 * Sort smaller blobs for placement by descending size (largest first to build structure), then by ascending color if sizes tie.
 * The output must form one fully connected structure (no disjoint blobs); isolated placements or failure to attach create gaps.
 * Subtlety: Original positions in input are irrelevant—everything must be relocated relative to the top-left-packed base; keeping original positions causes distant placements.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency scoring counts touching edges to any placed color (not just same color), but only after validating no overlap/out-of-bounds.
 * Subtlety: Empty input rows/columns should remain mostly empty except for the packed structure; outputs show packing starting around row 9-14 in examples, not row 0.
 * Consideration: Brute-force all possible translations (30x30 positions per blob), but optimize by checking validity early to avoid computation issues.
 * Consideration: If no valid position (e.g., due to size), the blob might not place, but examples show all blobs always placeable by attaching.
 * All blobs must preserve internal shape and relative positions—no rotation, flipping, or splitting.

                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```

def get_anchor(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Computes the top-left anchor (min row, then min col in that row) of a component.

    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_cs = [c for r, c in comp if r == min_r]
    min_c = min(min_cs)
    return min_r, min_c
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Connected component detection worked correctly in both training examples, accurately grouping same-color adjacent cells.
 * Anchor calculation is correct and helpful for translation.
 * Base selection by max size is correct, but placement failed: base kept in original scattered positions instead of translating to top-left (row 0, col 0 aligned), causing the entire structure to start mid-grid (e.g., 8's at row 14 in train1) and small blobs to place far away.
 * Placement of small blobs prioritized top-left empty spots (score 0) over attaching to base due to flawed tie-breaking and no initial base shift, leading to disjoint groups: in train1, 6/1/4/3/2 groups placed in rows 5-12 (upper-left isolated), not touching 8's base; 3's/4's misplaced in upper area instead of attaching below 8's in rows 20-25 as expected.
 * In train1 generated vs. expected: Upper empty rows 0-4 match, but generated places 6's/1's at rows 5-7 (too high, no touch to 8's), adds erroneous 4's/3's at rows 8-12 (overlapping/misplaced, expected empty), 2's at rows 12-13 partially touch 8's but overall disjoint; expected shifts 6/1/2 group to rows 9-13 touching 8's at col 4-8, adds 4's interwoven with 3's at rows 20-25 touching 8's at col 16-20—generated has no such lower attachment and wrong shapes (e.g., 4's not below 3's).
 * In train2 generated vs. expected: Base 2's correctly identified but kept original (rows 8-13 wide), small placements isolated: 3's/1's/4's scattered in rows 13-19 with overlaps/gaps (e.g., 3's at col 10-13 row 14-17 fragmented), 4's misplaced at col 22-25 row 13-14; expected packs 1's at row 13 col 10-13 touching 2's, 3's/4's below at rows 15-19 interwoven/touching (e.g., 4's frame 3's)—generated has disjoint 4's and unknown shape mismatches in 1/3 areas.
 * Sorting small blobs by (-size, color) is reasonable but ineffective without base shift.
 * Brute-force position search is conceptually good but computationally naive (30x30=900 checks per blob, up to ~10 blobs ok), but validity check works; scoring counts adjacencies correctly but fails to prefer base proximity without shift.
 * No rotation/deformation attempted, which is correct (preserves shapes).
 * Overall, attempts show partial understanding (blob extraction solid), but core failure in relocating base to top-left causes all placements to cascade wrong, resulting in 0/2 training passes; no unhelpful functions, but original-position base placement is broken for this puzzle.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It places a mixed 2/4/8/3 group in upper rows 0-4 (left cols 0-16), then 1's/6's in rows 14-20 (partially touching 3's but disjoint from upper), followed by long vertical 3's stacks in rows 6-29 (cols 9-15, separate from main group). This creates multiple disjoint structures (upper mixed, mid 1/6, lower 3's), not one connected whole packed top-left. Expected likely packs all (2/3/4/6/8/1) into a single interwoven blob starting ~row 0-5 left-aligned, with 3's integrated (not isolated verticals), 6's/1's attached to 8's/4's, and no gaps—generated has overlaps (e.g., 3's intrude on 8's at row 3 col 9-16?) and unknown shape distortions (e.g., 3's too fragmented vertically). Fails attachment rule, as lower 3's don't touch upper meaningfully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers 1-8 representing colors) where the goal is to identify connected components (polyominoes) of the same color, preserve the largest central component unchanged, clear or ignore smaller ones initially, and then rearrange the smaller components (size >=2 and typically < half the large one's size) into ordered stacks or attachments on the left and/or right sides of the large component, positioned relative to its vertical center with specific horizontal and vertical offsets based on color, size, or original position, while preserving their shapes and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The large component is the biggest connected group by cell count (not by color priority), and it must remain in its exact original position and shape; everything else is cleared before placing smalls.
 * Small components are only those with 2+ cells, connected by 4-directional adjacency (up/down/left/right), same color, and size < large_size // 2; single cells or tiny groups (<2) are ignored entirely.
 * Grouping smalls by approximate horizontal position: left side (avg column <15) vs. right side (avg column >=15), assuming a 30-column grid.
 * Within each group, sort by color ascending, then by vertical center (row average) ascending for stacking order.
 * Stacking: Place stacks vertically offset from the large component's vertical center (e.g., large_center_y ± (6 + order * 4)), at fixed x-centers (e.g., 6 for left, 17.5 for right); preserve shape via translation (shift by delta row/col, round to integers), but this can cause distortions if shapes don't align perfectly or if rounding clips cells.
 * Placement must check grid bounds and overwrite only zeros (no merging or overlapping with existing pixels); if translation causes out-of-bounds or overlaps, it may silently clip or fail.
 * Subtle: Vertical offset calculation uses comp_height incorrectly in the code (comp_center_r - min_row, but this isn't used properly); stacks should mimic "attachment" or "piling" without rotating or reshaping, but order might prioritize color over y-position in some cases.
 * Grid is 30 columns wide, variable rows (e.g., 30x30?); empty rows at top/bottom in outputs suggest vertical centering or trimming isn't needed.
 * Colors are treated distinctly but sorting is by color value (1<2<...<8); no rotation or mirroring of shapes.
 * Potential misses: Some smalls might attach directly to large (e.g., integrated in expected), not just stacked separately; offsets like 4.0 units per stack item ensure spacing; right-side stacks may shift further (e.g., +17.5 col center).
 * All attempts clear non-large pixels first, which works for isolation but fails if expected integrates smalls into/around large without full clearing.
 * Connected components must ignore different colors (only same-color adjacency).

    return new_positions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly detects all connected components and identifies the large one (e.g., the 8's in train1, 2's in train2), preserving it unchanged.
 * Clearing non-large pixels works to isolate the large component but fails because expected outputs rearrange smalls without fully clearing—smalls are placed in new positions but sometimes integrated or attached directly to the large one (e.g., 1's and 2's embedded in/around 8's in train1 expected).
 * Grouping by x-position (<15 left, else right) is partially helpful but too rigid— in train1 generated, all smalls (2's,4's,1's,3's) end up in awkward left/right stacks, but expected has 1's/2's on left integrated vertically with large, and 3's/4's stacked below as separate groups.
 * Sorting by color then y-center works for ordering but offset calculation is broken: get_target_center_y uses incorrect comp_height (comp_center_r - min(p[0])), leading to misaligned vertical positions (e.g., in train1 generated, 2's and 4's stacks are too high/low relative to 8's center ~row 16-17).
 * Translation and placement preserve shapes but rounding causes slight shifts/distortions (e.g., in train1 generated, 4's L-shape becomes misaligned at rows 4-8 left, not matching expected integrated positions); no overlap handling with large, causing potential overwrites.
 * In train1 generated: Large 8's correct, but smalls placed as separate stacks (4's left high, 2's left mid, 1's/3's bottom scattered) vs. expected (1's/2's woven into large at rows 10-14 left, 3's/4's as tight stacks bottom rows 20-29 rightish, with some 6's? wait, expected has 6's/1's/2's mixed left mid).
 * In train2 generated: Large 2's correct at rows 8-13, but smalls (4's top,1's mid-left,3's bottom) placed scattered vs. expected (1's/3's/4's stacked right bottom rows 14-20, integrated with 2's extensions at row 13 cols 10-13/21-22).
 * find_small_polyominoes filters correctly (< large//2, >=2) but misses that some smalls might be same-color as large or need different size thresholds.
 * clear_non_large_pixels is helpful for isolation but over-applies—expected keeps smalls' info for rearrangement without clearing until placement.
 * group_by_x_position and sort_by_color are directionally useful but hardcoded thresholds (15 col, 6/17.5 x-centers) fail for varying grid positions (e.g., train2 smalls all leftish but expected right-stacked).
 * get_stack_center_x and get_target_center_y have right idea (left/right, offset stacking) but offsets (6+order*4) too large/spaced, causing gaps/misalignments (e.g., train1 generated has huge empty spaces above/below stacks).
 * place_component is basic but lacks overlap avoidance with large or other smalls, leading to silent failures (e.g., if translated pos hits large, it overwrites to small color).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction and basic rearrangement but botches positioning/offsets, leading to all INCORRECT; no rotation/merging considered, which might be needed for integration.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it keeps a large block of 3's (rows 0-29 cols 9-15, size ~200+ cells) as central, which seems right, but places smalls (6's as scattered tetrominoes rows 2-7 left, 4's as polyomino rows 7-10 left/mid) overlapping or adjacent to large without proper stacking, then dumps 1's (row 20 right), 2's (rows 23-26 right), 8's (rows 27-29 right) as horizontal stacks below/right, creating a cluttered bottom without vertical alignment to large's center (~row 14-15).
 * Differences: Expected likely has smalls (1,2,4,6,8) stacked neatly left/right of large 3's center, ordered by color (1 then 2 left, 4/6/8 right?), with 4-unit vertical spacing, no overlaps, and shapes preserved (e.g., 6's I-shape vertical left, 4's S-shape attached mid-right); generated has misaligned x-centers (all smalls hugging left of large), incorrect y-offsets (bottom dumps too low, no centering), and possible clipping (8's at row 29 may bound out). This doesn't match puzzle rules as stacks aren't symmetrically attached/ordered relative to large.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 30x30 grid involving colored connected components (blobs of the same number/color), where the goal is to identify the largest "large" component, rearrange the smaller "small" components (size <20, excluding large size) by stacking them adjacent to the large one (vertically below if large is horizontal, horizontally to the right if vertical), sorted by color, while removing the original small components from the grid, and potentially integrating some smalls into or overwriting parts of the large component to form a new arrangement that matches a target scene or pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) of the same color/value; diagonals do not count.
 * The "large" component is the one with maximum size (number of cells); if ties, max() picks the first or arbitrary, but in examples, it's clear.
 * Small components are filtered as size <20 and size != large_size; this excludes the large and any medium/large duplicates, but may miss if there are multiples of large size.
 * Orientation check: Large is "horizontal" if (max_col - min_col +1) > (max_row - min_row +1); else vertical. This determines stacking direction (vertical stack below for horizontal large, horizontal stack right for vertical large).
 * Stacking: Small components are sorted by color ascending. For vertical stack (below horizontal large), align to large's min_col, start at large max_row +1, place each small shifted (dy to current_row, dx to align min_col), but constrain to a "common_width" (max width of smalls) and check bounds; increment current_row by small's height. For horizontal stack (right of vertical large), align to a fixed center_row ~13-15 with common_height=4, start at large max_col +1, shift dx to current_col, dy to align, constrain to common_height rows, increment current_col by small's width.
 * Removal: After placement, set original small positions to 0; this must happen after all placements to avoid overwriting new spots, but code does it last.
 * Subtleties: In expected outputs, some small components appear "integrated" or overwriting parts of the large (e.g., in train 1, 1/2/6 shapes cut into/near 8's in rows 9-13 and 14-15; in train 2, 1 integrated into 2's in row 13-14). Stacking is not always simple alignment—e.g., in train 1 expected, 3/4 stack in columns 16-19 starting row 19, interwoven shapes (not just shifted copies), right-aligned to large. In train 2, 3/4 stack vertically in columns 9-12 rows 15-20, but with specific offsets. Common dimensions (width/height) are assumed but not always max—may need per-component fitting or fixed sizes (e.g., height=4). Placement may overlap or modify large (not just adjacent). Originals must be fully removed, but generated often leaves them (e.g., bottom rows in train 1). Grid bounds (0-29) must be respected; out-of-bounds ignored. Colors are integers 1-8 typically. Multiple smalls of same color? Code treats as separate if disconnected. Queue in find_components appends without check, leading to inefficient/infinite if not bounded, but visited prevents. Flat_positions iterates all, good for full scan.
 * Easy to miss: Integration/overwriting large (not just stacking adjacent); exact alignment may be to large's right edge or center, not min_col; stacking may interleave shapes (e.g., train 1 row20: 4 3 3 4); common_height/width hardcoded or max may not fit expected (train 2 uses ~4 height but specific positions); removal must target only smalls, not large; if no smalls, return copy unchanged.
 * All considerations: Bugs in shifting (e.g., dy/current_row wrong, leading to top placement instead of below); constraint checks (new_col < common_min_col + width) may clip shapes; sorting by color works but expected may reverse or group same color; horizontal stack centers at row 13 but expected may differ (train 2 stacks lower); vertical large not tested well (train 1 large is horizontal, train 2 is horizontal too? Wait, train 2 large 2's rows 8-12 cols 0-29, width=30>height=5, horizontal).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The component finding and basic extraction are helpful but buggy in queue/visited. Placement and removal need fixes. Types like Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int,int]]] for (color, size, min_col, max_col, min_row, max_row, positions) are useful for bounding box + pos list.

```python

                    for dx, dy in directions:

                        queue.append((nx, ny))  # Note: appends even out-of-bounds, but if-check skips; inefficient but works with visited.
            if size > 0:
                min_row = min(p[0] for p in positions)
                max_row = max(p[0] for p in positions)
                min_col = min(p[1] for p in positions)

    return components

                h[row][col] = 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates partial understanding of component extraction and basic stacking logic but fails on placement position, removal, and integration.
 * Component finding works for identifying blobs/sizes/bounds/positions, but queue appends unbounded neighbors (inefficient, but visited bounds it); helpful for extraction.
 * get_large and get_small are correct for selecting large and filtering smalls (<20, != large_size), matching examples (e.g., train 1 large=8 size~100+, smalls 3/4 size~10-15; train 2 large=2 size~120, smalls 1/3/4 <20).
 * is_horizontal correctly detects orientation (train 1/2 both horizontal, so vertical stack attempted).
 * sort_small_by_color works (e.g., train 1 sorts 3 then 4; train 2 sorts 1,3,4).
 * Placement functions (place_vertical_stack, place_horizontal_stack) have logic for shifting positions (dx/dy based on alignment) and bounds check, but buggy: in vertical_stack, current_row starts at large max_row+1 but generated places at top (rows 2-6 vs expected 19+); dx aligns to large min_col but clips to common_width, leading to partial/misplaced shapes (train 1: 4/3 in cols 7-11 rows 2-6, incomplete). Horizontal_stack assumes common_height=4 and center_row=13, but untested (both trains horizontal large); may clip vertically.
 * remove_original_small is correct in intent (set small pos to 0) but fails in generated (e.g., train 1 leaves 1/2/3/6 at bottom rows 22-29 and row 8; train 2 leaves 1 at top rows 1-4, 3/4 at bottom); possibly because components list includes non-smalls or placement overwrites incompletely, or bug in pos list.
 * No integration handled: Expected overwrites large with some smalls (train 1: 1/2/6 in rows 9-13 cols4-8, 2's in large rows14-15; train 2: 1 in large row13 cols10/12); code only stacks adjacent, no overwriting large.
 * compute_common_width uses max small width, helpful for alignment but too loose (expected stacks tighter, e.g., train 1 cols16-19 width=4 < max small width~5).
 * Overall, extraction tools essential and mostly correct; placement/removal broken; no handling for shape-specific offsets or interleaving in stack (e.g., train 1 row20: alternating 4/3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be mostly the original input grid with partial overwriting or misplaced smalls (e.g., 3's dominant in center cols9-15 rows0-29, like large 3; 8's shifted right cols18-22 rows3-6; 6's left bottom rows13-16 cols0-3; 2's row17 col21-23; 1's bottom right rows25-28 col22-23), but originals not removed (e.g., overlapping 3's everywhere, 4's scattered rows4-7 cols3-7). This suggests failed removal and incorrect shifting, similar to trains—stacking attempted but positions wrong (e.g., not cleanly below/right of large, no integration). Expected likely has clean stack of smalls (1,2,4,6,8? sorted 1,2,4,6,8) adjacent to large 3, with originals gone and possible overwriting (e.g., smalls cut into 3's or stacked tightly cols16+ rows large_end+1). Without exact expected, it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle—messy overlaps, no clear sorted stack, bounds violated implicitly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid with colored blobs (connected components of integer values representing colors, e.g., 1-8), where the goal is to rearrange these blobs by rigidly translating them (shifting without rotation, scaling, or deformation) to new positions in an output grid. The rearrangement should form a coherent, non-overlapping image or picture, likely by filling gaps in a large "base" structure, attaching small blobs adjacently or within bounding boxes, and positioning others to complete shapes like letters, digits, or scenes, while preserving the original shape and color of each blob.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), so the connected components function must use orthogonal directions only—diagonal connections do not count as part of the same blob.
 * The largest blob (by cell count, tiebroken by highest color value) is typically the "base" or frame and should remain in its relative position or be placed centrally/unchanged, but smaller blobs must be translated to fill holes (empty 0 cells within the base's bounding box), attach to edges for adjacency, or extend outward to form additional structures without any overlaps or going out of bounds.
 * Placement must be rigid: entire blob shifts by the same (dr, dc), and no cell of the shifted blob can land on a non-zero cell in the output; however, placements can fill 0-cells inside the base's bounding box even if not directly adjacent initially.
 * Subtlety: The puzzle likely aims to reconstruct a specific "picture" (e.g., text like digits or letters formed by colors), so scoring for placement should prioritize not just filling the base bbox and adjacency but also global structure, such as sorting small blobs by color or min-row for sequential placement (e.g., top-to-bottom or left-to-right assembly), and avoiding scattering—blobs may need to form new connected groups across colors.
 * Overlaps are strictly forbidden, but the output can have intentional 0-holes in the final image; all input non-zero cells must be placed somewhere, or the output may be all zeros if no valid arrangement (but examples suggest full rearrangement).
 * Easy to miss: Base may have irregular shapes with internal 0s (holes), so placements can "infill" those; small blobs may need to be placed outside the base to form extensions (e.g., in train1 expected, 3s and 4s form a separate shape below); brute-force shifting (-30 to 30) is computationally heavy but necessary, but scoring must weight higher-level goals like minimizing overall bbox or maximizing total connections across all blobs.
 * Tiebreaking for base: Use size first, then max color, but if multiple large blobs, may need to choose the one that acts as a "frame" (e.g., surrounding others).
 * Sorting smalls: By increasing color, then min-row of original positions, but this may not capture puzzle order (e.g., place low colors on top).
 * Global considerations: Output should resemble a complete image (e.g., train1 expected forms what looks like a "6" or "E" on top with 1s/6s, a filled 8-base with 2s, and a "43"-like shape below with 3s/4s); scattered or partially overlapping placements fail; if no components, output all zeros.
 * Potential for multiple valid positions per blob—need backtracking or better scoring to find the exact configuration that matches the "intended" picture.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    visited = [[False] * 30 for _ in range(30)]
    components = []
    for i in range(30):
        for j in range(30):
            if g[i][j] > 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30 and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((color, component))
    return components
```
(This function correctly extracts 4-connected components by color, using DFS with stack; essential for identifying blobs to rearrange. Returns list of (color, list of (r,c) positions).)

The main program function uses this to find components, select base, and attempt placements, but the placement logic (brute-force shifts with scoring) is helpful as a starting point but needs refinement for scoring.

No other types or tools from the attempt; no unhelpful functions noted beyond the flawed scoring in the main logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies and extracts connected components, keeping the base blob fixed and attempting to translate small blobs rigidly without overlap.
 * Base selection by max size (tie by color) worked for choosing the large 8 in train1, but placement of smalls failed to match expected infills and extensions (e.g., in train1, 1s/2s/6s should form top structures and fill 8-holes precisely, but generated scattered 1s/2s inside/over 8s wrongly and placed 4s at right edge disconnected).
 * What worked: Rigid translation and no-out-of-bounds checks prevented invalid placements; infill scoring (counting proposed cells inside base bbox) partially captured hole-filling, and adjacency count encouraged touching the base.
 * What didn't work: Scoring prioritized fill > adj > -min_r > -min_c, leading to top-left bias that ignored global picture formation (e.g., in train1 generated, 2s partially placed in row11-13 but misaligned with expected row14-15 infill; 1s overwrote or filled wrong 8-holes, creating mixed rows like row14 with 8s/1s/2s where expected has clean 8s+2s infill; 3s/4s/6s dumped at bottom/right disconnected, while expected integrates them into separate shapes below).
 * In train2, base 2s correctly placed as large block, but small 1s/3s/4s placed scattered (e.g., generated has 1s/3s in row13-17 left, 4s partial in row13, but expected stacks them compactly below/right without scattering, forming a vertical extension; unknown why generated placed 3s with holes and 4s fragmented).
 * Brute-force loop over dr/dc (-30 to 30) is correct but inefficient and fails due to poor score (e.g., many positions have equal fill/adj, falling to top-left which mismatches puzzle's structural needs like sequential color placement).
 * Sorting smalls by color then min_r is somewhat helpful for order but misses puzzle's likely top-to-bottom assembly.
 * get_connected_components is essential and correct; no broken functions, but the placement scoring is flawed/not helpful as-is (leads to suboptimal positions; suggest weighting total image connectivity or matching expected shapes).
 * Both training examples incorrect: train1 generated has misplaced infills (e.g., 1s in row12-13 where expected has them higher in row9-12 as separate shape) and extra 0-holes in 8s; train2 generated fragments smalls (e.g., 4s in row13 col23-25 but expected consolidates them lower in row18-21).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it features a massive repeated block of 3s across columns 9-15 in rows 0-29 (like a thick vertical bar of 3s with minor intrusions), plus scattered 4s on left (rows 3-6), 8s on top-right (rows 2-5), 2s on bottom-right (rows 11-14), and 6s/1s at very bottom (rows 17-20), creating a disjoint, over-emphasized 3-structure that ignores rigid blob shapes.
 * This mismatches likely expected: Assuming similar to trains, the large 3-blob should be base (placed centrally), with small 4/8/2/6/1 blobs translated to fill its gaps (e.g., 4s/8s infilling holes for a solid frame) and extend outward (e.g., 2s/6s/1s forming attached shapes like digits on sides/top/bottom); instead, generated duplicates 3-like patterns (possibly multiple placements or bbox miscalc) and leaves most grid empty/disconnected, failing to form a coherent picture (e.g., no evident letter/digit assembly; 8s/2s isolated).
 * Subtleties missed: Test likely requires placing smalls to connect across colors (e.g., 6s+1s forming a top extension like in train1), but generated scatters them; the over-large 3-block suggests scoring bug where multiple shifts for same color succeed wrongly or base bbox is over-filled without overlap check enforcement.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored cells (numbers 1-8 representing colors), where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs of the same color, 4-connected orthogonally), select the largest as a "base" structure, place it in the output grid, and then reposition the smaller detached components adjacent to or integrated with the base to reconstruct a coherent overall image or pattern, likely mimicking an original assembled form. The program attempts this by scoring placements based on bounding box fill, adjacency to existing cells, and proximity to the base's center, but fails to produce the expected rearrangements in training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be strictly same-color and 4-connected (up, down, left, right only—no diagonals), ignoring isolated cells or different colors; the grid is 30x30, so bounds checking is critical to avoid overflows.
 * The "base" is the largest component by cell count (with color as tiebreaker), placed at its original relative positions (or origin?), while smalls are translated rigidly (preserving shape) to new positions without rotation, overlap, or out-of-bounds.
 * Placement prioritizes integration: favor positions where the small component fills gaps in the base's bounding box, maximizes edge adjacency to already-placed cells (to "attach" like puzzle pieces), and minimizes distance from the base's center; however, the scoring must avoid arbitrary or distant placements—subtlety is that some smalls may need to attach to other smalls or specific base edges, not just the center.
 * Sorting smalls: by descending size, then color, then topmost row—to place larger/more prominent pieces first, but this may need adjustment if order affects attachment (e.g., place by proximity to base first).
 * No overlapping allowed (output cell can't be rewritten), and empty cells (0) remain 0 unless filled; the output should reconstruct a specific expected pattern, implying the puzzle has a unique "correct" assembly, possibly like reattaching limbs or details to a main body.
 * Subtle elements: Anchor for translation is the top-left cell of each component, but this may cause misalignment if shapes are irregular—consider shape-relative anchors (e.g., centroid). Adjacency count in scoring double-counts shared edges, potentially overprioritizing loose attachments. In examples, smalls like 4's or 6's are placed far from base or in wrong orientations relative to expected (e.g., bottom vs. top). Grid may have background (color 8?) that acts as filler or frame, but shouldn't overwrite it incorrectly. Exhaustive search (30x30 trials per small) is computationally heavy but necessary; early stopping or bounding the search to base vicinity could help.
 * All components must be placed if possible, but if no valid spot (score-based), they might be omitted or default-placed—examples show some smalls missing or misplaced, suggesting validation fails too strictly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve exact shapes (no rotation/scaling); handle multiple smalls attaching sequentially (updating out grid affects later placements); colors must match exactly (no recoloring).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and extracts all connected components (e.g., in train1, it finds the large 8 background, 1/2 shapes, 3/4/6 smalls), and base selection works (picks largest like 8's or 2's).
 * Placement logic partially works: avoids overlaps and bounds, places base at origin positions, and attempts attachments via scoring—but fails to find expected positions, resulting in smalls placed far away or in wrong spots (e.g., in train1, 4's placed at row10-13 cols15-18 instead of bottom rows20-29 cols16-19 with 3's; 6's at row19-20 cols2-6 instead of top row9-10 cols4-8).
 * Sorting smalls by size/color/top-row is helpful but insufficient—may need sorting by attachment potential (e.g., proximity to base edges) to place interlocking pieces first.
 * Scoring tuple (fill, adj, -dist) is a good start (prioritizes bbox fill > adjacency > closeness), but overvalues loose adjacencies (counts all neighbor cells, even non-base) and underweights shape fit—leads to suboptimal placements like scattering smalls near base center instead of exact puzzle-fit positions.
 * In train2, base 2's placed correctly across rows8-12, but smalls like 1's at row14 col10-12 (expected row14 col10-13 but shifted), 3's/4's scattered low (row15-20) instead of clustered right/bottom; unknown why 4's attach poorly to 3's.
 * get_smalls and place_base/place_comp are solid for separation and output building.
 * sort_smalls is mostly helpful but tiebreakers (color, min_r) may bias wrong order for sequential placement.
 * find_best_placement is core but broken: exhaustive search finds some valid spots but picks wrong "best" due to score (e.g., in train1, prefers top placements for 4's over bottom; adj count includes future smalls incorrectly as it checks current out only).
 * No rotation or mirroring considered, which is correct (shapes preserved), but translation anchor (top-left) causes offsets in irregular blobs.
 * Overall, trains incorrect: generated has all components but misplaced (e.g., train1 expected has 6's top, 3/4 bottom attached to 8's frame; generated flips/misaligns); train2 similar mismatches in small positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it places a large vertical/horizontal 3's structure (likely base) spanning rows0-29 cols9-15, then attaches 8's left (rows1-4 cols5-8), 1's mid-right (rows12-14 cols16-17), 6's and 2's bottom-left (rows16-20 cols7-9 and 16-17), and 4's bottom-right (rows25-28 cols16-19), but this seems scattered and doesn't form a coherent assembly (e.g., 1's and 4's look loosely attached without filling gaps, 6/2 overlap potential or distant). Without expected, it appears wrong based on train patterns: expects tighter integration like train1's bottom 3/4 cluster or train2's right-side smalls; likely mis-scores placements, placing 8's too high/left instead of framing overall, and smalls not in puzzle-like fits (e.g., 2's should attach to 3's edge, not offset).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 01:50:06] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of colored blobs (connected components of integers 1-8 representing colors), where the goal is to identify and preserve the largest "base" blob, clear out the rest, and rigidly translate (move without rotation or deformation) the smaller blobs to attach them adjacently to the base or previously placed blobs, forming a coherent reconstructed image that matches an expected arrangement, likely by simulating how pieces "snap" together in a jigsaw-like manner.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are strictly 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals) groups of the same non-zero color (1-8); zeros are empty space.
 * The base blob is the largest by cell count (tie-broken by highest color value) and must remain fixed in its original position; all other cells are cleared to zero initially.
 * Smaller blobs must be placed via rigid translation only (no rotation, scaling, or splitting); placements must be fully in bounds (0-29 rows/cols), avoid overlap with any existing non-zero cells (base or prior placements), and require at least one adjacent cell (4 directions) touching a non-zero cell for validity.
 * Order of placement matters: process smaller blobs sorted by their original minimum row (top-to-bottom) to prioritize upper pieces.
 * Scoring for best placement is multi-factor: maximize cells falling within the base's bounding box (fill), maximize adjacent edges to existing structure (adjacency count), minimize distance from the small blob's center to the base's center (proximity), and bias toward top-left positions (min row/col) to resolve ties or prefer canonical arrangements.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency is counted per edge (not per cell), so a single cell can contribute up to 4; placements can attach to previously placed smalls, not just the base (cumulative structure); empty space in the base's bbox is allowable but scored against; original positions influence processing order but not final placement; the puzzle assumes no two smalls of the same color merge during placement (colors stay distinct).
 * Potential misses: Brute-force search over all possible dr/dc (-29 to 29) is computationally heavy but necessary; scoring may overprioritize fill/proximity, leading to internal placements instead of external attachments; no rotation means shapes must match exactly via translation; grids may have isolated smalls or large bases spanning much of the grid; expected outputs show thematic arrangements (e.g., train1 forms a face-like structure with 8's as background, 1/2/6/3/4 as features).
 * All considerations: Preserve mutability with grid copies; handle empty components gracefully; compute anchors/bbox/centers accurately for scoring; ensure no self-overlap in smalls (assumed connected); test for zero-adjacency to reject floating pieces.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly extracts connected components and selects/clears the base, but fails at placement: small blobs are translated to invalid or suboptimal positions, often stacking linearly or overlapping subtly instead of forming the expected interconnected shapes.
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated keeps a partial base of 8's but places 1's/2's in a scattered row (e.g., row 10-11 has 1's and 2's misplaced left-side), 4's below but detached, 6's and 3's at bottom in wrong clusters; expected has 6's/1's/2's attached top to 8's base, 3's/4's as bottom extensions forming a structured figure—difference is in attachment points and relative positioning (unknown why scoring picked internal/low-adjacency spots).
 * In training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated preserves large 2's base but places 1's/4's/3's in fragmented positions (e.g., row 13 has scattered 1's and 4's, 3's below detached); expected consolidates 1's/3's/4's into compact attachments on the base's side/bottom—mismatch in compactness and adjacency, with generated having extra zeros and poor fill.
 * The find_best_translation function is broken/not helpful: its brute-force search works but scoring (fill > adj > -dist > -min_r > -min_c) overprioritizes base bbox fill and top-left bias, causing smalls to crowd inside the base area or stack vertically instead of extending outward; it counts adj per potential neighbor but doesn't penalize poor shape matching; don't use current version without reweighting (e.g., boost adj/dist more).
 * sort_smalls_by_original_position is helpful but assumes top-to-bottom order mimics assembly sequence, which may not hold if puzzle requires left-to-right or color-based ordering.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core understanding of components/base but lacks in placement logic; no rotation considered (correct, as expected doesn't rotate), but search range is exhaustive (good) yet inefficient.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it selects what appears to be a large 3's blob as base (rows 0-29, columns 9-15ish, vertical stack) and places other smalls (8's top-attached, 1's mid-right, 6's/2's bottom-left, 4's bottom-right) in a mostly vertical, linear arrangement with some protrusions, but this forms a tall, disjoint column-like structure rather than a cohesive 2D shape—expected likely has more horizontal spreading, better interconnections (e.g., 8's wrapping around 3's, smalls filling gaps to form a figure), and no isolated extensions (e.g., 1's seem floating rightward without strong adjacency); differences include over-reliance on vertical stacking (probably from top-left bias in scoring) and failure to maximize overall structure density/proximity, leading to a sparse, tower-like result instead of compact puzzle assembly.

[2025-10-02 01:50:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:06:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 30x30 grids where cells contain integers representing colors or shapes, and the goal is to process the input grid `g` to produce an output grid `h` by extracting connected components (blobs of the same color) and reassembling them into a single, integrated structure—likely a vertical "tower" or stacked figure where smaller components are placed on top of or embedded within the largest/base component, preserving their relative shapes and positions but translated and possibly interlocked, rather than placed separately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way (up, down, left, right) groups of the same color; diagonal doesn't count, and different colors are always separate even if adjacent.
 * The base is typically the largest component (by cell count), placed at the "bottom" of the output (higher row indices), but other components are not stacked separately beside or above it—instead, they are integrated into or on top of the base structure, often filling "spaces" or aligning to form a cohesive figure (e.g., smaller shapes like 1,2,6 sit atop or within the 8's in training 1, and 3,4 are embedded in the 8's lower section).
 * Components must preserve their exact relative shapes (no rotation, flipping, or deformation); use min_r/min_c normalization to translate them without changing internal structure.
 * Sorting: Non-base components are processed in ascending color order (e.g., 1 before 2 before 3), but placement is vertical stacking from bottom to top, aligned to the left or right (in expecteds, often right-aligned or centered within the base's width).
 * Subtlety: The entire figure in `h` is often shifted to start from near the top (low row indices) or bottom, with empty rows above/below; avoid spreading components across the full 30x30—keep them compact and integrated to match the "puzzle assembly" feel.
 * Handle multiple components per color? The code assumes one per color, but inputs may have disconnected same-color blobs (though examples suggest connected); if disconnected, treat as separate and place individually.
 * Overlaps/resolution: When placing, if a cell already has a color, do not overwrite—new placements should fit into empty (0) spaces within the base, suggesting the base has "holes" or indented areas designed for embedding smaller pieces.
 * Empty output if no components.
 * Grid bounds: Always 30x30; placements must stay within 0-29, clipping if needed (but examples don't clip).
 * Easy to miss: The "stacking" isn't linear/separate—it's architectural, like building a tower where pieces snap into place (e.g., in training 1 expected, 2's protrude from 8's at row 14 cols 5-7, 3's fill gaps in 8's at row 19 cols 17-20, and upper pieces like 6/1/2 form a sub-tower on left of 8's starting row 9).
 * Rough height estimation in code (sum(len)/5) is unhelpful and leads to poor positioning; instead, calculate exact bounding boxes and place sequentially from base top upward, adjusting start_r based on base's max_r +1 or embedding offsets.
 * Color preservation: Output uses the same color values; 0 is empty.

    # Helpful: Normalizes a component's positions relative to its top-left (min_r, min_c), preserving shape for translation.
    # Use before placing to allow flexible positioning without distortion.
    if not comp:
        return []
    min_r = min(r for r, c in comp)
    min_c = min(c for r, c in comp)
    return [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in comp]
```

```python
def place_shape(h: List[List[int]], color: int, rel: List[Tuple[int, int]], start_r: int, start_c: int):
    # Helpful but needs modification: Places a relative component at (start_r, start_c), but should check for conflicts (e.g., skip if h[r][c] != 0) to allow embedding without overwriting.
    # Current version overwrites, which is wrong for integration.
    n = 30
    for dr, dc in rel:
        r = start_r + dr
        c = start_c + dc
        if 0 <= r < n and 0 <= c < n:
            h[r][c] = color  # TODO: Add if h[r][c] == 0 to avoid overwriting base.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly extracts components using find_components and identifies the largest as base, which works for base selection (e.g., 8 in train 1, 2 in train 2).
 * Relative positioning with get_relative works to preserve shapes.
 * Sorting others by color ascending is partially correct (matches order in expecteds: 1,2 then 3,4).
 * What didn't work: Placement logic treats non-base components as separate stacks on the left above the base (using rough height estimate and current_r += height), leading to disjoint blobs instead of integrated structure—e.g., in train 1 generated, 1/2/3/4/6 are stacked separately in cols 0-4 rows 3-22, while base 8 is below in rows 14-21 cols 0-29 overlapping messily; expected has them embedded/aligned within 8's footprint (e.g., 6/1/2 in cols 4-8 rows 9-13 atop left of 8, 3/4 in cols 17-20 rows 19-25 within 8's gaps).
 * In train 1: Generated has extra/misplaced cells (e.g., 3's scattered in rows 10-13 cols 1-3, but expected has no upper 3's—only lower embedded 3's; 4's at bottom separate, but expected integrates 4's with 3's in 8's; unknown why generated 8's have internal 3's in rows 14-16 but not matching expected positions/shapes).
 * In train 1: Base placement works (8's in lower rows), but others overwrite or misalign (e.g., generated row 14 has 8,8,3,3,8... but expected row 14 has 8's with 2's embedded).
 * In train 2: Generated places 1's separate in rows 3-6 cols 1-3, 3's partial in row 7-8, but base 2's in rows 8-13 cols 0-29 with some 3/4 intrusions; expected has 2's as base in rows 8-13, but 1/3/4 stacked compactly on right/lower (rows 14-20 cols 9-12 for 1/3/4, no overlaps).
 * Bug in others filtering: `if c[1] != base_comp` compares list objects (always True even for same positions), so includes base if multiple same-color components; but examples have one per color.
 * place_base clears entire grid and places base correctly, but subsequent placements don't respect base's occupied cells.
 * Rough current_r calculation (base_min_r - sum(len)/5) often starts too low/high, causing overlaps or gaps; e.g., in train 1, starts at row ~3 but expected upper pieces at row 9.
 * No alignment consideration: Generated left-aligns everything at col 0, but expecteds right-align or center within base width (e.g., train 1 upper at cols 4-8, lower embeds at cols 17-20).
 * Function place_shape is mostly helpful but broken for this puzzle—overwrites existing cells, preventing proper embedding; modify to only place in 0's.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it places small components (1,2,4,6,8) in a disjoint left stack (cols 0-4 rows 0-20, with shapes like 1 in rows 0-2 cols 2, 2 in 4-7, etc.), and treats 3's as a wide base across cols 9-15 rows 0-29 (repeating the 3 shape vertically, which distorts it—e.g., row 2 has 0,3,3,... but shape should be preserved once). This matches the attempt's flawed separate-stacking logic, but a correct output should integrate all into one tower: base likely the largest (3's, ~50+ cells wide), with 1/2/4/6/8 embedded atop or within (e.g., 1/2 on left upper, 4/6/8 filling gaps), compacted vertically from ~row 5-25, left-shifted but not full-width separate. The vertical repetition of 3's is especially wrong—relative shapes must be placed once, translated, not tiled. Unknown exact positions without expected, but disjoint placement mismatches training expecteds' integration.

[2025-10-02 02:06:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
