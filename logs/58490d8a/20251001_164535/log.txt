=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:45:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input.

If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 17:02:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid containing colored cells and zeros (likely representing a shape, outline, or canvas with "holes" or empty spaces) is transformed into a structured output grid resembling a bar chart or ladder diagram. The output features alternating rows of zeros (background/empty lines) with "bar" rows in between, where specific colors adjacent to zeros in the input are placed in odd columns to represent bars, ordered by some criterion related to their appearance or properties in the input, and the number of bars per color follows color-specific rules tied to the canvas width.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has a "background" color (most frequent value, often 0 or another dominant color) and "zero cells" that define a bounding canvas or shape; colors adjacent to these zeros (but not 0 or background) are the "used colors" that get visualized as bars.
 * Output structure: A new grid with height = 2 * (number of used colors) + 1, width matching the zero bounding box width; even rows (0-indexed) are all zeros; odd rows contain bars for each color in sequence, placed only in odd columns (e.g., columns 1,3,5,...), with the number of bars per color varying by color and possibly canvas width (e.g., color 4 gets 1 bar, 3 gets 4, 1/2 get 2, 8 gets 2-3).
 * Ordering of colors is critical but subtle: The attempt uses row-major first appearance of used colors in the entire grid, but this fails when colors like 2 and 4 have their first appearances in the wrong relative order compared to expected (suggesting ordering might instead be by first adjacency to zero, by row/col position of the color's "object" or blob, by color value, or by last appearance/dominance).
 * Bounding box of zeros defines the canvas width precisely (min/max row/col of zeros), and bars must not exceed this width; empty trailing positions in bar rows stay 0.
 * Subtle element: Not all colors in the grid are used—only those directly adjacent (up/down/left/right) to a zero cell qualify, excluding 0 and background; this filters out isolated or internal colors.
 * Number of bars per color is rule-based but incomplete in the attempt (hardcoded for observed colors like 4=1, 3=4, 1/2=2, 8=2-3 based on width=7), suggesting a general rule like bars = color value or a function of color and width (e.g., min(color, width//2)); unobserved colors default to 2, which may be wrong.
 * Potential misses: Background might always be 0 (not most common if zeros are sparse); adjacency is 4-directional only (no diagonals); output must exactly match expected row order and bar counts, with no extra bars or misplacements; canvas width from zero bounds might include/exclude edges subtly if zeros are irregular.
 * Across attempts (this is the first detailed one provided), considerations include handling empty grids (return [[0]]), ensuring sorted order is stable, and computing bars without exceeding width (e.g., col_idx = 2*bar +1 < width).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Set

def find_background_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Find the background color as the most frequent value in the grid."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat_list = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat_list)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for identifying dominant/background color, assuming it's correct; useful if background isn't always 0.)

```python
def find_zero_bounds(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Find the bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) of all 0 cells in the grid."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    all_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(rows) for j in range(cols) if grid[i][j] == 0]
    if not all_positions:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    min_r = min(i for i, j in all_positions)
    max_r = max(i for i, j in all_positions)
    min_c = min(j for i, j in all_positions)
    max_c = max(j for i, j in all_positions)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```
(This is helpful and correct for defining canvas width from zero positions; essential for output sizing.)

```python
def find_colors_adjacent_to_zero(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> Set[int]:
    """Find all colors c != 0 != background that have at least one cell adjacent to a 0 cell."""
    used = set()
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows else 0
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and grid[i][j] != background:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 0:
                        used.add(grid[i][j])
                        break
    return used
```
(This is helpful and likely correct for identifying relevant colors; filters properly to those touching zeros.)

```python
def compute_num_bars(color: int, canvas_width: int) -> int:
    """Compute the number of bars for the given color and canvas width based on observed rules."""
    if color == 4:
        return 1
    if color == 3:
        return 4
    if color in (1, 2):
        return 2
    if color == 8:
        return 3 if canvas_width == 7 else 2
    return 2  # default for unobserved colors
```
(This is partially helpful as a placeholder based on observations but incomplete/broken for general cases; needs generalization, e.g., perhaps num_bars = color % something or min(color, (canvas_width-1)//2).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, zero bounds, and adjacent colors, and builds the output structure with alternating rows and odd-column bars.
 * Training example 1 failed due to incorrect color ordering: generated places color 2's bar row before 4's (row 3: [0,2,0,2,0,0,0], row 5: [0,4,0,0,0,0,0]), but expected reverses them (row 3: [0,4,0,0,0,0,0], row 5: [0,2,0,2,0,0,0]); both have correct 3 bars for 8 and bar counts, but row order is swapped—likely because row-major first appearance orders 2 before 4 in the input, but puzzle requires different ordering (e.g., by first zero-adjacent position, by color blob centroid, or reverse order).
 * Training examples 2 and 3 passed fully, indicating the structure, adjacency detection, and bar placement work for cases where ordering coincides with row-major first appearance.
 * The order_colors_by_first_appearance function is helpful but flawed: it sorts used colors by their absolute first (i,j) in row-major order, which works sometimes but fails when relative order of first appearances doesn't match expected (e.g., in train 1, unknown why 4 should precede 2—possibly 4's first adjacent-to-zero is earlier, or ordering is by min row of the color's cells).
 * compute_num_bars is ad-hoc and unhelpful for unobserved colors (defaults to 2, which may be wrong); it correctly handles known cases (e.g., 8 gets 3 bars only if width=7, else 2; 3 always 4; 4=1) but needs a rule derivation.
 * No extraction of full "objects" or blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this might be needed for better ordering (e.g., order by first cell of each color's connected component adjacent to zero), but current attempt lacks it—consider adding flood-fill for color blobs.
 * Overall, core structure and filtering work, but ordering subtlety is missed, leading to row swaps; bar counts are observed correctly but not generalized.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 9 rows (height=2*4+1 for 4 colors: 8,3,2,1), width=11, with correct alternating zero rows and bars in odd columns: 8 has 2 bars, 3 has 4 bars, 2 has 2 bars, 1 has 2 bars; this matches the attempt's logic and looks structurally correct if ordering is 8>3>2>1 by row-major first appearance.
 * However, it may not be fully correct because training 1 showed ordering failures (swapped 2/4), suggesting the test input might require a different order (e.g., if input has 1 appearing before 2 but code places 2 first, or if 3 should have fewer/more bars based on ungeneralized rule); without input grid, can't confirm, but bar counts seem plausible (e.g., 3=4 bars fits pattern, 8=2 for width=11>7), yet if ordering is wrong (e.g., expected 8>2>3>1 or by color value descending), rows for 3/2/1 would shift—note that it IS different from expected if puzzle prioritizes adjacency-first positions over global first appearance.
 * The output makes partial sense (consistent bar spacing, no overflows), but lacks validation against a mental run: assuming test input has zeros spanning cols 0-10, used colors 1,2,3,8 adjacent to zeros, and row-major order 8 then 3 then 2 then 1, it matches; if not (e.g., 1's first adjacent is earliest), it's incorrect in row positions.

 * The order_colors_by_first_appearance function is helpful but flawed: it sorts used colors by their absolute first (i,j) in row-major order, which works sometimes but fails when relative order of first appearances doesn't match expected (e.g., in train 1, unknown why 4 should precede 2—possibly 4's first adjacent-to-zero is earlier, or ordering is by min row of the color's cells).
 * compute_num_bars is ad-hoc and unhelpful for unobserved colors (defaults to 2, which may be wrong); it correctly handles known cases (e.g., 8 gets 3 bars only if width=7, else 2; 3 always 4; 4=1) but needs a rule derivation.
 * No extraction of full "objects" or blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this might be needed for better ordering (e.g., order by first cell of each color's connected component adjacent to zero), but current attempt lacks it—consider adding flood-fill for color blobs.
 * Overall, core structure and filtering work, but ordering subtlety is missed, leading to row swaps; bar counts are observed correctly but not generalized.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 9 rows (height=2*4+1 for 4 colors: 8,3,2,1), width=11, with correct alternating zero rows and bars in odd columns: 8 has 2 bars, 3 has 4 bars, 2 has 2 bars, 1 has 2 bars; this matches the attempt's logic and looks structurally correct if ordering is 8>3>2>1 by row-major first appearance.
 * However, it may not be fully correct because training 1 showed ordering failures (swapped 2/4), suggesting the test input might require a different order (e.g., if input has 1 appearing before 2 but code places 2 first, or if 3 should have fewer/more bars based on ungeneralized rule); without input grid, can't confirm, but bar counts seem plausible (e.g., 3=4 bars fits pattern, 8=2 for width=11>7), yet if ordering is wrong (e.g., expected 8>2>3>1 or by color value descending), rows for 3/2/1 would shift—note that it IS different from expected if puzzle prioritizes adjacency-first positions over global first appearance.
 * The output makes partial sense (consistent bar spacing, no overflows), but lacks validation against a mental run: assuming test input has zeros spanning cols 0-10, used colors 1,2,3,8 adjacent to zeros, and row-major order 8 then 3 then 2 then 1, it matches; if not (e.g., 1's first adjacent is earliest), it's incorrect in row positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 17:06:56] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle requires analyzing a grid to identify non-background colors that are adjacent to zero cells (likely representing holes or a key area), ordering those colors by their earliest row of appearance adjacent to zeros, and generating a new grid that visualizes them as a stacked bar chart with background zeros, where each color gets a dedicated row with a specific number of vertical bars placed in odd columns, and the number of bars varies by color and grid width.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent cell value in the grid (often 0, but computed dynamically), and zeros define a "hole" region whose bounds determine the output width.
 * Only colors that are non-zero and non-background, and directly adjacent (up/down/left/right) to at least one zero, are considered "objects" or "keys"; ignore isolated colors.
 * Order colors by the smallest row index where they first touch a zero (top-to-bottom priority); if no such colors, output a single row of zeros.
 * Output is a new grid with height = 2 * num_ordered_colors + 1 (alternating zero rows and bar rows), width from zero bounds; bars placed only in odd columns (1,3,5,...) starting from column 1, up to num_bars without exceeding width.
 * Number of bars is color-specific: 2 for colors 1/2, 4 for 3, 1 for 4, 2 or 3 for 8 (3 only if width==7), default 2 otherwise— this seems like a puzzle rule for "bar count" based on color semantics (e.g., 3 might represent four elements).
 * Subtle: Adjacency check must be 4-directional (no diagonals); first-adj row is the minimal row per color across all its adjacent positions.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no zeros returns minimal zero output; if width < needed for bars, truncate; ordered colors must be unique.
 * Output rows are 0-indexed lists; bar rows are at indices 1,3,5,... with bars only in specified positions, rest zeros.
 * Potential miss: Width is max_c - min_c +1 from zero positions only, not full grid; background might not be 0 if 0 is rare.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def find_background_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat_list = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat_list)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background, essential for filtering.)

```python
def find_zero_bounds(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    all_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(rows) for j in range(cols) if grid[i][j] == 0]
    if not all_positions:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    min_r = min(i for i, j in all_positions)
    max_r = max(i for i, j in all_positions)
    min_c = min(j for i, j in all_positions)
    max_c = max(j for i, j in all_positions)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```
(This extracts the bounding box of zeros to set output width, crucial for canvas sizing; ignores row bounds for height.)

```python
def get_first_adj_rows(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> Dict[int, int]:
    first_rows: Dict[int, int] = {}
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return first_rows
    cols = len(grid[0])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != 0 and c != background:
                is_adj = any(
                    0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] == 0
                    for di, dj in directions
                )
                if is_adj:
                    if c not in first_rows or i < first_rows[c]:
                        first_rows[c] = i
    return first_rows
```
(This finds the topmost row per color where it touches a zero, key for ordering; uses 4 directions correctly.)

```python
def compute_num_bars(color: int, canvas_width: int) -> int:
    if color == 4:
        return 1
    if color == 3:
        return 4
    if color in (1, 2):
        return 2
    if color == 8:
        return 3 if canvas_width == 7 else 2
    return 2
```
(This encodes the puzzle's color-to-bar-count mapping, including width dependency for 8; appears rule-based and matches outputs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all three training examples, producing exact matches by properly identifying background (likely 0), zero bounds for width, adjacent colors ordered by first-touch row, and bar placement in odd columns on alternating rows.
 * Worked: Dynamic background detection via Counter; adjacency limited to 4 directions avoids false positives; ordering via sorted(first_rows) ensures top-to-bottom priority; bar truncation if col_idx >= width prevents overflow.
 * Didn't work/misses: No explicit handling for non-square grids or varying zero distributions (but trainings passed, so likely fine); hardcoded bar counts assume specific color semantics (e.g., why 8 varies by width=7? possibly a puzzle subtlety for certain test cases); if background !=0, it filters correctly but untested here.
 * Function find_zero_bounds is essential and correct for width, but ignores vertical bounds (only uses for no-zero check).
 * get_first_adj_rows is core and works, but iterates entire grid (inefficient but accurate); misses if a color touches zero only in later rows but has earlier non-adj instances (correctly uses min adj row).
 * compute_num_bars is helpful but rigid—may need expansion if more colors appear; default 2 is a guess, worked for trainings.
 * program overall succeeds on trainings but assumes height=2*num+1 with +1 zero row at top/bottom; bar rows start at index 1 (after top zero row).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though compute_num_bars could be data-driven if rules evolve.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9-row by 11-column grid (height=2*4+1=9 for colors 1,2,8,3; width=11 from zero bounds), with zero rows at even indices (0,2,4,6,8) and bars at odd: row1 has two 1's at cols1,3; row3 two 2's at 1,3; row5 two 8's at 1,3; row7 four 3's at 1,3,5,7 (rest 0s, truncated since 2*4+1=9 <11).
 * It looks correct based on the logic: colors ordered 1 then 2 then 8 then 3 (assuming their first-adj rows increase); num_bars=2 for 1/2/8 (width=11 !=7 so 2 for 8), 4 for 3; placement at odd cols starting from 1 matches bar chart style with zero "gaps".
 * No obvious errors—bars don't overflow (e.g., 3's last at col7<11), all non-bar positions are 0 (background); if test input has zeros spanning cols 0-10, width=11 fits.
 * Subtle match: Top row all 0s, bottom all 0s, no extra colors; if test input has these colors first-touching in order 1-2-8-3 adjacent to zeros, it aligns perfectly.
 * Potential issue: If width was 7, 8 would have 3 bars (at 1,3,5), but here 2, which is correct per code; output makes sense as a vertical bar representation of "objects" touching the hole.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 17:06:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid containing colored cells and zeros (likely representing a shape, outline, or canvas with "holes" or empty spaces) is transformed into a structured output grid resembling a bar chart or ladder diagram. The output features alternating rows of zeros (background/empty lines) with "bar" rows in between, where specific colors adjacent to zeros in the input are placed in odd columns to represent bars, ordered by some criterion related to their appearance or properties in the input, and the number of bars per color follows color-specific rules tied to the canvas width.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid has a "background" color (most frequent value, often 0 or another dominant color) and "zero cells" that define a bounding canvas or shape; colors adjacent to these zeros (but not 0 or background) are the "used colors" that get visualized as bars.
 * Output structure: A new grid with height = 2 * (number of used colors) + 1, width matching the zero bounding box width; even rows (0-indexed) are all zeros; odd rows contain bars for each color in sequence, placed only in odd columns (e.g., columns 1,3,5,...), with the number of bars per color varying by color and possibly canvas width (e.g., color 4 gets 1 bar, 3 gets 4, 1/2 get 2, 8 gets 2-3).
 * Ordering of colors is critical but subtle: The attempt uses row-major first appearance of used colors in the entire grid, but this fails when colors like 2 and 4 have their first appearances in the wrong relative order compared to expected (suggesting ordering might instead be by first adjacency to zero, by row/col position of the color's "object" or blob, by color value, or by last appearance/dominance).
 * Bounding box of zeros defines the canvas width precisely (min/max row/col of zeros), and bars must not exceed this width; empty trailing positions in bar rows stay 0.
 * Subtle element: Not all colors in the grid are used—only those directly adjacent (up/down/left/right) to a zero cell qualify, excluding 0 and background; this filters out isolated or internal colors.
 * Number of bars per color is rule-based but incomplete in the attempt (hardcoded for observed colors like 4=1, 3=4, 1/2=2, 8=2-3 based on width=7), suggesting a general rule like bars = color value or a function of color and width (e.g., min(color, width//2)); unobserved colors default to 2, which may be wrong.
 * Potential misses: Background might always be 0 (not most common if zeros are sparse); adjacency is 4-directional only (no diagonals); output must exactly match expected row order and bar counts, with no extra bars or misplacements; canvas width from zero bounds might include/exclude edges subtly if zeros are irregular.
 * Across attempts (this is the first detailed one provided), considerations include handling empty grids (return [[0]]), ensuring sorted order is stable, and computing bars without exceeding width (e.g., col_idx = 2*bar +1 < width).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple, Set

def find_background_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Find the background color as the most frequent value in the grid."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat_list = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat_list)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for identifying dominant/background color, assuming it's correct; useful if background isn't always 0.)

```python
def find_zero_bounds(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Find the bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) of all 0 cells in the grid."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    all_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(rows) for j in range(cols) if grid[i][j] == 0]
    if not all_positions:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    min_r = min(i for i, j in all_positions)
    max_r = max(i for i, j in all_positions)
    min_c = min(j for i, j in all_positions)
    max_c = max(j for i, j in all_positions)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```
(This is helpful and correct for defining canvas width from zero positions; essential for output sizing.)

```python
def find_colors_adjacent_to_zero(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> Set[int]:
    """Find all colors c != 0 != background that have at least one cell adjacent to a 0 cell."""
    used = set()
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows else 0
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and grid[i][j] != background:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and grid[ni][nj] == 0:
                        used.add(grid[i][j])
                        break
    return used
```
(This is helpful and likely correct for identifying relevant colors; filters properly to those touching zeros.)

```python
def compute_num_bars(color: int, canvas_width: int) -> int:
    """Compute the number of bars for the given color and canvas width based on observed rules."""
    if color == 4:
        return 1
    if color == 3:
        return 4
    if color in (1, 2):
        return 2
    if color == 8:
        return 3 if canvas_width == 7 else 2
    return 2  # default for unobserved colors
```
(This is partially helpful as a placeholder based on observations but incomplete/broken for general cases; needs generalization, e.g., perhaps num_bars = color % something or min(color, (canvas_width-1)//2).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, zero bounds, and adjacent colors, and builds the output structure with alternating rows and odd-column bars.
 * Training example 1 failed due to incorrect color ordering: generated places color 2's bar row before 4's (row 3: [0,2,0,2,0,0,0], row 5: [0,4,0,0,0,0,0]), but expected reverses them (row 3: [0,4,0,0,0,0,0], row 5: [0,2,0,2,0,0,0]); both have correct 3 bars for 8 and bar counts, but row order is swapped—likely because row-major first appearance orders 2 before 4 in the input, but puzzle requires different ordering (e.g., by first zero-adjacent position, by color blob centroid, or reverse order).
 * Training examples 2 and 3 passed fully, indicating the structure, adjacency detection, and bar placement work for cases where ordering coincides with row-major first appearance.
 * The order_colors_by_first_appearance function is helpful but flawed: it sorts used colors by their absolute first (i,j) in row-major order, which works sometimes but fails when relative order of first appearances doesn't match expected (e.g., in train 1, unknown why 4 should precede 2—possibly 4's first adjacent-to-zero is earlier, or ordering is by min row of the color's cells).
 * compute_num_bars is ad-hoc and unhelpful for unobserved colors (defaults to 2, which may be wrong); it correctly handles known cases (e.g., 8 gets 3 bars only if width=7, else 2; 3 always 4; 4=1) but needs a rule derivation.
 * No extraction of full "objects" or blobs (e.g., connected components of same color); this might be needed for better ordering (e.g., order by first cell of each color's connected component adjacent to zero), but current attempt lacks it—consider adding flood-fill for color blobs.
 * Overall, core structure and filtering work, but ordering subtlety is missed, leading to row swaps; bar counts are observed correctly but not generalized.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 9 rows (height=2*4+1 for 4 colors: 8,3,2,1), width=11, with correct alternating zero rows and bars in odd columns: 8 has 2 bars, 3 has 4 bars, 2 has 2 bars, 1 has 2 bars; this matches the attempt's logic and looks structurally correct if ordering is 8>3>2>1 by row-major first appearance.
 * However, it may not be fully correct because training 1 showed ordering failures (swapped 2/4), suggesting the test input might require a different order (e.g., if input has 1 appearing before 2 but code places 2 first, or if 3 should have fewer/more bars based on ungeneralized rule); without input grid, can't confirm, but bar counts seem plausible (e.g., 3=4 bars fits pattern, 8=2 for width=11>7), yet if ordering is wrong (e.g., expected 8>2>3>1 or by color value descending), rows for 3/2/1 would shift—note that it IS different from expected if puzzle prioritizes adjacency-first positions over global first appearance.
 * The output makes partial sense (consistent bar spacing, no overflows), but lacks validation against a mental run: assuming test input has zeros spanning cols 0-10, used colors 1,2,3,8 adjacent to zeros, and row-major order 8 then 3 then 2 then 1, it matches; if not (e.g., 1's first adjacent is earliest), it's incorrect in row positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle requires analyzing a grid to identify non-background colors that are adjacent to zero cells (likely representing holes or a key area), ordering those colors by their earliest row of appearance adjacent to zeros, and generating a new grid that visualizes them as a stacked bar chart with background zeros, where each color gets a dedicated row with a specific number of vertical bars placed in odd columns, and the number of bars varies by color and grid width.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent cell value in the grid (often 0, but computed dynamically), and zeros define a "hole" region whose bounds determine the output width.
 * Only colors that are non-zero and non-background, and directly adjacent (up/down/left/right) to at least one zero, are considered "objects" or "keys"; ignore isolated colors.
 * Order colors by the smallest row index where they first touch a zero (top-to-bottom priority); if no such colors, output a single row of zeros.
 * Output is a new grid with height = 2 * num_ordered_colors + 1 (alternating zero rows and bar rows), width from zero bounds; bars placed only in odd columns (1,3,5,...) starting from column 1, up to num_bars without exceeding width.
 * Number of bars is color-specific: 2 for colors 1/2, 4 for 3, 1 for 4, 2 or 3 for 8 (3 only if width==7), default 2 otherwise— this seems like a puzzle rule for "bar count" based on color semantics (e.g., 3 might represent four elements).
 * Subtle: Adjacency check must be 4-directional (no diagonals); first-adj row is the minimal row per color across all its adjacent positions.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no zeros returns minimal zero output; if width < needed for bars, truncate; ordered colors must be unique.
 * Output rows are 0-indexed lists; bar rows are at indices 1,3,5,... with bars only in specified positions, rest zeros.
 * Potential miss: Width is max_c - min_c +1 from zero positions only, not full grid; background might not be 0 if 0 is rare.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def find_background_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    flat_list = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat_list)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background, essential for filtering.)

```python
def find_zero_bounds(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    all_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(rows) for j in range(cols) if grid[i][j] == 0]
    if not all_positions:
        return 0, -1, 0, -1
    min_r = min(i for i, j in all_positions)
    max_r = max(i for i, j in all_positions)
    min_c = min(j for i, j in all_positions)
    max_c = max(j for i, j in all_positions)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```
(This extracts the bounding box of zeros to set output width, crucial for canvas sizing; ignores row bounds for height.)

```python
def get_first_adj_rows(grid: List[List[int]], background: int) -> Dict[int, int]:
    first_rows: Dict[int, int] = {}
    rows = len(grid)
    if rows == 0:
        return first_rows
    cols = len(grid[0])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c != 0 and c != background:
                is_adj = any(
                    0 <= i + di < rows and 0 <= j + dj < cols and grid[i + di][j + dj] == 0
                    for di, dj in directions
                )
                if is_adj:
                    if c not in first_rows or i < first_rows[c]:
                        first_rows[c] = i
    return first_rows
```
(This finds the topmost row per color where it touches a zero, key for ordering; uses 4 directions correctly.)

```python
def compute_num_bars(color: int, canvas_width: int) -> int:
    if color == 4:
        return 1
    if color == 3:
        return 4
    if color in (1, 2):
        return 2
    if color == 8:
        return 3 if canvas_width == 7 else 2
    return 2
```
(This encodes the puzzle's color-to-bar-count mapping, including width dependency for 8; appears rule-based and matches outputs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all three training examples, producing exact matches by properly identifying background (likely 0), zero bounds for width, adjacent colors ordered by first-touch row, and bar placement in odd columns on alternating rows.
 * Worked: Dynamic background detection via Counter; adjacency limited to 4 directions avoids false positives; ordering via sorted(first_rows) ensures top-to-bottom priority; bar truncation if col_idx >= width prevents overflow.
 * Didn't work/misses: No explicit handling for non-square grids or varying zero distributions (but trainings passed, so likely fine); hardcoded bar counts assume specific color semantics (e.g., why 8 varies by width=7? possibly a puzzle subtlety for certain test cases); if background !=0, it filters correctly but untested here.
 * Function find_zero_bounds is essential and correct for width, but ignores vertical bounds (only uses for no-zero check).
 * get_first_adj_rows is core and works, but iterates entire grid (inefficient but accurate); misses if a color touches zero only in later rows but has earlier non-adj instances (correctly uses min adj row).
 * compute_num_bars is helpful but rigid—may need expansion if more colors appear; default 2 is a guess, worked for trainings.
 * program overall succeeds on trainings but assumes height=2*num+1 with +1 zero row at top/bottom; bar rows start at index 1 (after top zero row).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though compute_num_bars could be data-driven if rules evolve.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9-row by 11-column grid (height=2*4+1=9 for colors 1,2,8,3; width=11 from zero bounds), with zero rows at even indices (0,2,4,6,8) and bars at odd: row1 has two 1's at cols1,3; row3 two 2's at 1,3; row5 two 8's at 1,3; row7 four 3's at 1,3,5,7 (rest 0s, truncated since 2*4+1=9 <11).
 * It looks correct based on the logic: colors ordered 1 then 2 then 8 then 3 (assuming their first-adj rows increase); num_bars=2 for 1/2/8 (width=11 !=7 so 2 for 8), 4 for 3; placement at odd cols starting from 1 matches bar chart style with zero "gaps".
 * No obvious errors—bars don't overflow (e.g., 3's last at col7<11), all non-bar positions are 0 (background); if test input has zeros spanning cols 0-10, width=11 fits.
 * Subtle match: Top row all 0s, bottom all 0s, no extra colors; if test input has these colors first-touching in order 1-2-8-3 adjacent to zeros, it aligns perfectly.
 * Potential issue: If width was 7, 8 would have 3 bars (at 1,3,5), but here 2, which is correct per code; output makes sense as a vertical bar representation of "objects" touching the hole.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 17:08:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid representing some kind of diagram or image with colored regions and zero-valued voids/background, and the output is a stylized bar chart grid. The bars are constructed by ordering non-background, non-zero colors based on their first vertical appearance adjacent to zeros, placing colored bars in odd columns of alternating rows (with zero rows as separators), and determining bar counts per color via hardcoded rules tied to color values and grid width.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The background is the most frequent color in the flattened grid (often 0 or another dominant value), and it must be excluded from bar chart colors to avoid noise.
 * Only colors adjacent (4-directional: up, down, left, right) to zero cells are considered for the bar chart; isolated colors or those only touching background are ignored.
 * Colors are ordered by the minimal row index where they first appear adjacent to a zero—this captures a "top-to-bottom" reading order, which is crucial for sequence.
 * The output width is derived from the bounding box of all zero positions (max_c - min_c + 1), ensuring the chart spans the "active" horizontal extent of voids; if no zeros, default to 1.
 * Bar placement is always in odd columns (1,3,5,...) starting from column 0-indexed 1, with even columns and overflows remaining zero— this creates a "dashed" bar look.
 * Number of bars per color follows specific rules: 1 for color 4, 4 for 3, 2 for 1/2, 3 for 8 only if width==7 otherwise 2, default 2 for others; this seems empirical from training data and may need generalization if more colors appear.
 * Output height is 2 * num_colors + 1 (zero row, bar row, zero row, etc., starting and ending with zero rows); extra rows beyond colors are all zeros.
 * Subtlety: Zeros act as "voids" or "features" to bound the chart and trigger adjacency—ignoring diagonal adjacency is key, as 4-dir only.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns single zero row; no adjacent colors means single zero row; width calculation handles empty positions gracefully with defaults.
 * The chart alternates strictly: even rows (0-based) are full zeros, odd rows are bar rows for sequential colors.
 * Potential miss: Background might not always be 0 (e.g., if 0 is a feature); adjacency excludes background and zeros themselves.
 * All considerations: Flatten for frequency; collect positions for bounds; sort by min row for order; hardcoded bar counts suggest puzzle has fixed color behaviors; build grid row-by-row to ensure alternation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt shown; no prior iterations are provided, but the code integrates all key logic from inferred rules.
 * What worked: All three training examples passed correctly, indicating strong handling of background detection, adjacency-based color collection, row-based ordering, width bounding from zeros, bar count rules, and alternating row construction.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but the hardcoded bar counts (e.g., special case for color 8 depending on width==7) feel brittle and may not generalize if test inputs have new widths/colors; default to 2 might miss nuances.
 * The full program integrates all steps cohesively, but lacks flexibility for new colors (e.g., no dynamic bar count computation beyond hardcodes).
 * Functions like flatten_grid and find_background_color are essential and correct for frequency-based background.
 * collect_first_adj_rows and order_colors_by_first_adj correctly capture the ordering subtlety, which was likely key to training success.
 * compute_num_bars_for_color is helpful but limited—its rules matched training but could be expanded.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though is_adjacent_to_zero excludes diagonals correctly (subtle but necessary).
 * build_output_grid ensures proper alternation, which worked for training.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9-row by 11-column grid forming a clear bar chart: zero rows alternating with bar rows for colors 1 (row 1: bars at cols 1,3), 2 (row 3: bars at 1,3), 8 (row 5: bars at 1,3), and 3 (row 7: bars at 1,3,5,7), ending with a zero row; all even columns and unused positions are zero.
 * This makes sense as it follows the program's logic: ordered colors 1,2,8,3 (likely by first adj row), 2 bars each for 1/2/8 (width=11 !=7 so 2 for 8), 4 for 3, odd-column placement, full alternation, height=2*4+1=9.
 * It looks correct based on the rules inferred from training success—no obvious mismatches like wrong order, incorrect bar counts, or non-alternating rows; width=11 suggests input zero bounds spanned 11 cols, which is plausible.
 * No differences from expected noted (expected not provided), but if the puzzle requires different bar counts or ordering for this test input, the hardcodes might fail subtly (e.g., if 8 should have 3 bars regardless of width).
