=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 14:55:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

[2025-10-03 14:59:00] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid puzzle where a large input grid contains a bounding area defined by zero cells (forming a frame or enclosure), with colored cells (non-zero integers representing colors) both inside and outside this bounds. The goal is to generate a smaller output grid that abstracts the "key" or pattern by extracting representative colors from specific rows inside the zero bounds and then placing a number of those color instances in the output equal to the count of connected components of that color found outside the bounds, arranged in a sparse, alternating pattern (e.g., on odd rows and odd columns) to visualize the external structure or multiplicity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The zero cells define a rectangular bounding box (minr, minc, maxr, maxc); everything outside this box is considered "external" for component counting, but the output grid is sized exactly to the height and width of this box.
 * Pattern colors are extracted only from odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1 relative to minr) inside the bounds, taking the first non-zero value encountered in each such row from left to right; this seems to identify "key rows" or representative colors for each "level" of the pattern, but it skips even rows and assumes a single color per such row—subtle issue if rows have mixed colors or no non-zeros.
 * Connected components are counted using 8-directional flood fill (Moore neighborhood), but only for cells of the target color that are strictly outside the zero bounds; this correctly isolates external "objects" but may overcount or undercount if components touch the bounds without being inside (the code excludes any cell inside bounds, even if connected externally).
 * In the output grid, placements are only on odd rows (2*pi + 1) and odd columns (2*jj + 1), up to roughly half the width (w//2), creating a dotted or checker-like pattern; the number of placements per color equals the min of the external component count and max_k (w//2), which caps placements but may truncate if there are more components than slots—easy to miss if external components exceed available output space.
 * If no zeros exist, output an empty grid; if a pattern color is 0, skip it entirely.
 * Subtle edge case: The flood fill marks visited only for external cells of the exact color, but the initial check for starting cells also enforces outside bounds; this prevents internal components from being counted but could miss components that wrap around the grid edges.
 * The output preserves the zero bounds' dimensions but fills only specific positions, leaving most cells as 0, which simulates a "skeleton" or "key" view of external multiplicity.
 * Potential miss: Colors might repeat across pattern rows, leading to multiple processing of the same color; the code handles this by processing each independently, which could over-place if not intended.
 * Grid dimensions: Assumes rectangular input with N rows and M columns; output is h x w where h = maxr - minr + 1, w = maxc - minc + 1.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly passed all three training examples, indicating solid handling of basic cases where zero bounds are well-defined, pattern colors are extractable from odd rows, and external component counts match expected placements without exceeding output slots.
 * What worked: Zero bounds detection accurately frames the enclosure; pattern color extraction reliably picks representatives from odd internal rows; outside component counting uses proper 8-dir connectivity and excludes internals, which aligned with training outputs.
 * What didn't work: The test output appears incomplete or mismatched in density—e.g., it places only two 1's (row 1, cols 1 and 3), two 2's (row 3), four 8's (row 5, up to col 7), and five 3's (row 7, up to col 9), but caps at w//2=5 (assuming w=11); this suggests the component counts were 2 for 1, 2 for 2, 4 for 8, and 5+ (capped) for 3, but if the puzzle expects uncapped or different positioning (e.g., even rows or full width), it fails; unknown why 8's are only four if more components exist externally.
 * The output grid initializes to zeros and only fills odd positions, which worked for training but may not capture full patterns if the puzzle requires denser filling or inclusion of internal elements.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code's main program integrates the functions well; however, it assumes pattern rows don't exceed h (breaks if out_row >= h), which could silently truncate tall grids.
 * Function `count_outside_components` is helpful and correct for external isolation but could be extended to return component sizes if the puzzle cares about blob volume rather than count.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though `get_pattern_colors` might be brittle if rows have no non-zeros or multiple colors (it takes the first, ignoring rest).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x11 grid (implying h=9, w=11 from zero bounds) with placements only on odd rows (1,3,5,7) and odd columns (1,3,5,7,9), forming a sparse pattern: two 1's on row 1, two 2's on row 3, four 8's on row 5 (stopping at col 7, possibly capped), and five 3's on row 7 (full cap at col 9); all else zero.
 * This does not look fully correct, as the placements seem truncated (e.g., only four 8's despite potential for five slots, and five 3's filling all), suggesting the external component count for 8 was exactly 4 while others matched or exceeded caps; however, if the puzzle expects placements based on something else (e.g., internal counts, total components including inside, or different row selection), this mismatches—specifically, row 5 has four 8's but skips col 9, which differs from uniform capping seen in other rows.
 * The output makes partial sense as a "multiplicity key" (more external components = more placements), but it's likely incorrect because it doesn't fill the last slot for 8's (col 9 remains 0 on row 5), and the pattern colors seem to be 1,2,8,3 from rows 1,3,5,7 inside bounds; if expected output should have symmetric or full capping across all, or include even rows, this is different for unknown reasons (possibly off-by-one in counting or bounds).
 * No empty rows are filled beyond the pattern, which is consistent but may miss if test expects a denser grid.
