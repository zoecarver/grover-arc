=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 02:00:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:15:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s to treat them as filled cells for block detection."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]

                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < 3:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(grid[j])
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows (width becomes height, height becomes width)."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]

    t = transpose(grid)
    t_processed = remove_large_all_one_row_blocks(t)
    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 02:15:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s (potentially useful for hidden fillers, but untested here)."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s (helpful for detecting filler blocks, but extend to all-4s or mixed for better accuracy)."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```

```python
def remove_large_all_one_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove blocks of 3+ consecutive all-1 rows (partially helpful for vertical fillers, but broken for non-all-1 patterns, column trimming, or 2D shapes—causes mismatches in examples 1,2,4)."""
    processed = replace_sevens_to_one(grid)
    n = len(processed)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(processed[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(processed[i]):
                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < 3:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(processed[j])
        else:
            result.append(processed[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:30:42] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

    t = transpose(grid)
    t_processed = remove_large_all_one_row_blocks(t, min_block)
    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

[2025-10-01 02:30:52] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all 4 training input/output pairs, below is a list of only those connections or interactions between elements that are **consistent across EVERY example**. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships (e.g., position affecting position, pixel count affecting pixel count) that appear in all cases without exception. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Interactions that vary (e.g., specific hole count changes only in train 3, or small Yellow repositioning only in train 1) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent transformations (e.g., exact mechanism of Blue pixel reduction, or why some Blue shapes persist unchanged) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **Dark Red presence and position → Absence in output + Influence on Blue position**:
   - All inputs contain exactly 2 Dark Red shapes (holes=0, low pixels ≤3 each).
   - All outputs contain 0 Dark Red shapes (complete removal).
   - Positions (bbox) of the 2 input Dark Red shapes consistently correlate with the positions (bbox) of new or modified Blue (holes=0) shapes in the output—specifically, at least one output Blue bbox overlaps or is adjacent to (within Δx≤3, Δy≤2 of) at least one input Dark Red bbox in every case.
   - Unknown: Exact transformation rule (e.g., how Dark Red coordinates map to new Blue dimensions or pixels).

2. **Total Yellow pixels (across all Yellow shapes) → Conserved in output**:
   - Sum of pixels for all Yellow shapes (regardless of holes or bbox) in input equals sum in output exactly (train 1: 36=36; train 2: 20=20; train 3: 16=16; train 4: 22=22).
   - This implies pixel area from input Yellow components is redistributed (e.g., to main Yellow) without loss or gain.
   - Interaction with other colors: No direct link to Blue or Dark Red pixels, which are not conserved.

3. **Small Yellow (holes=0, pixels ≤9) → Pixel contribution to main Yellow (holes≥1)**:
   - All inputs with small Yellow (holes=0, pixels ≤9) show their pixels added to the main Yellow (largest bbox starting at [0,0,...], holes≥1) in the output, increasing the main Yellow's pixel count by exactly the small Yellow's input pixels (train 1: +8; train 2: +4; train 4: +9; train 3 has none, so no change).
   - The small Yellow shapes themselves are removed in output (0 such shapes persist unchanged).
   - Position link: Small Yellow bbox position does not consistently affect main Yellow bbox (varies by case).
   - Unknown: Why train 1 has an additional small Yellow (p=2) in output (not conserved as "small" in all cases).

4. **Main Yellow (holes≥1, largest bbox from [0,0,...]) bbox → Expansion in output**:
   - The main Yellow's bbox in output always fully contains or expands beyond the input main Yellow's bbox (e.g., increased x2, y2, or merged in train 3), consistently incorporating space previously occupied by removed small Yellow or certain Blue shapes.
   - Interaction with Dark Red: Expansion direction correlates with Dark Red positions (e.g., toward the span between the 2 Dark Red bboxes) in every case.
   - Unknown: Exact bbox calculation rule (e.g., how much expansion, or handling of multiple main Yellow in input like train 3).

5. **Blue pixels (total across all Blue shapes) → Reduction in output**:
   - Sum of pixels for all Blue (holes=0) shapes decreases in every output compared to input (train 1: 49→20; train 2: 69→22; train 3: 5→2; train 4: 39→38; note: train 4 is minimal change but still ≤ input).
   - Some input Blue shapes persist unchanged (e.g., small isolated Blue like [4,2,4,2] in train 2), but total reduction is consistent.
   - No conservation or direct transfer to Yellow (Yellow total unchanged).
   - Unknown: Mechanism of reduction (e.g., what determines which Blue pixels are removed vs. kept, or link to Dark Red beyond position).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., hole count changes, color-specific transformations, or shape count correlations) appear in every example. Elements like isolated small Blue (unchanged in some but modified in others) or specific edge/hole properties do not show uniform connections across all. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., any potential "purple" not present in data) are ignored.

[2025-10-01 02:32:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s (potentially useful for hidden fillers, but untested here)."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s (helpful for detecting filler blocks, but extend to all-4s or mixed for better accuracy)."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```

```python
def remove_large_all_one_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove blocks of 3+ consecutive all-1 rows (partially helpful for vertical fillers, but broken for non-all-1 patterns, column trimming, or 2D shapes—causes mismatches in examples 1,2,4)."""
    processed = replace_sevens_to_one(grid)
    n = len(processed)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(processed[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(processed[i]):
                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < 3:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(processed[j])
        else:
            result.append(processed[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

    t_processed = remove_large_all_one_row_blocks(t)
    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

        if is_all_one(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < min_block:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(grid[j])
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0])
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]
```

```python
def remove_large_all_one_column_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove blocks of min_block or more consecutive all-1 columns by transposing, processing rows, and transposing back."""
    t = transpose(grid)
    t_processed = remove_large_all_one_row_blocks(t, min_block)
    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all 4 training input/output pairs, below is a list of only those connections or interactions between elements that are **consistent across EVERY example**. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships (e.g., position affecting position, pixel count affecting pixel count) that appear in all cases without exception. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Interactions that vary (e.g., specific hole count changes only in train 3, or small Yellow repositioning only in train 1) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent transformations (e.g., exact mechanism of Blue pixel reduction, or why some Blue shapes persist unchanged) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **Dark Red presence and position → Absence in output + Influence on Blue position**:
   - All inputs contain exactly 2 Dark Red shapes (holes=0, low pixels ≤3 each).
   - All outputs contain 0 Dark Red shapes (complete removal).
   - Positions (bbox) of the 2 input Dark Red shapes consistently correlate with the positions (bbox) of new or modified Blue (holes=0) shapes in the output—specifically, at least one output Blue bbox overlaps or is adjacent to (within Δx≤3, Δy≤2 of) at least one input Dark Red bbox in every case.
   - Unknown: Exact transformation rule (e.g., how Dark Red coordinates map to new Blue dimensions or pixels).

2. **Total Yellow pixels (across all Yellow shapes) → Conserved in output**:
   - Sum of pixels for all Yellow shapes (regardless of holes or bbox) in input equals sum in output exactly (train 1: 36=36; train 2: 20=20; train 3: 16=16; train 4: 22=22).
   - This implies pixel area from input Yellow components is redistributed (e.g., to main Yellow) without loss or gain.
   - Interaction with other colors: No direct link to Blue or Dark Red pixels, which are not conserved.

3. **Small Yellow (holes=0, pixels ≤9) → Pixel contribution to main Yellow (holes≥1)**:
   - All inputs with small Yellow (holes=0, pixels ≤9) show their pixels added to the main Yellow (largest bbox starting at [0,0,...], holes≥1) in the output, increasing the main Yellow's pixel count by exactly the small Yellow's input pixels (train 1: +8; train 2: +4; train 4: +9; train 3 has none, so no change).
   - The small Yellow shapes themselves are removed in output (0 such shapes persist unchanged).
   - Position link: Small Yellow bbox position does not consistently affect main Yellow bbox (varies by case).
   - Unknown: Why train 1 has an additional small Yellow (p=2) in output (not conserved as "small" in all cases).

4. **Main Yellow (holes≥1, largest bbox from [0,0,...]) bbox → Expansion in output**:
   - The main Yellow's bbox in output always fully contains or expands beyond the input main Yellow's bbox (e.g., increased x2, y2, or merged in train 3), consistently incorporating space previously occupied by removed small Yellow or certain Blue shapes.
   - Interaction with Dark Red: Expansion direction correlates with Dark Red positions (e.g., toward the span between the 2 Dark Red bboxes) in every case.
   - Unknown: Exact bbox calculation rule (e.g., how much expansion, or handling of multiple main Yellow in input like train 3).

5. **Blue pixels (total across all Blue shapes) → Reduction in output**:
   - Sum of pixels for all Blue (holes=0) shapes decreases in every output compared to input (train 1: 49→20; train 2: 69→22; train 3: 5→2; train 4: 39→38; note: train 4 is minimal change but still ≤ input).
   - Some input Blue shapes persist unchanged (e.g., small isolated Blue like [4,2,4,2] in train 2), but total reduction is consistent.
   - No conservation or direct transfer to Yellow (Yellow total unchanged).
   - Unknown: Mechanism of reduction (e.g., what determines which Blue pixels are removed vs. kept, or link to Dark Red beyond position).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., hole count changes, color-specific transformations, or shape count correlations) appear in every example. Elements like isolated small Blue (unchanged in some but modified in others) or specific edge/hole properties do not show uniform connections across all. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., any potential "purple" not present in data) are ignored.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:43:13] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle similar to simplifying a Nonogram or logic grid by removing redundant uniform blocks of filled cells (1s, including 7s treated as 1s) and empty cells (4s), focusing on large consecutive rows or columns to collapse the grid to its essential pattern without altering non-uniform or small blocks. The goal is to iteratively trim these blocks until the grid stabilizes, preserving the core visual structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 1s early, as they represent filled cells equivalent to 1s for block detection but may indicate special cases like hints or overlaps.
 * Distinguish between filled blocks (1s): remove even single all-1 rows/columns (min_block=1), as they often represent thin borders or fillers; empty blocks (4s): only remove if 3+ consecutive (min_block=3), to avoid over-trimming sparse empty areas.
 * Process iteratively in a loop (rows then columns, alternating) until dimensions stabilize, as removals can create new uniform blocks; transpose for column handling.
 * Preserve non-uniform rows/columns entirely, and small blocks (< min_block) to maintain pattern details like partial fills or edges.
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), so handle empty or uneven grids gracefully; expected outputs often show collapsed borders, revealing asymmetric or irregular core shapes.
 * Subtle: Uniform blocks must be strictly all-1 or all-4; mixed cells (e.g., 1s with 4s) block removal. In examples, top/bottom/left/right borders are often trimmed differently based on uniformity.
 * Potential over-removal: Aggressive min=1 for 1s can collapse too much if patterns have thin filled lines; under-removal happens if iteration misses propagated changes.
 * Shape mismatches in outputs indicate failures in transposition or block counting, e.g., expected grids are often shorter/wider than generated.
 * No rotation or cell-value changes beyond 7->1; focus on deletion of entire rows/columns.

(Note: Column versions via transpose are helpful but derived; no custom types needed beyond List[List[int]]. No object extraction functions were present or relevant here, as the puzzle is about grid simplification, not entity detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles 7->1 replacement and iterative row/column processing with different min_blocks, succeeding on Training 3 (exact match, likely due to balanced uniform borders).
 * Failed on Training 1: Generated kept extra 1-filled and 4-mixed rows/columns (e.g., retained bottom all-1 rows and irregular 4/1 mixes), resulting in taller/wider grid than expected; did not trim enough thin 1-blocks or propagated 4-blocks, leaving artifacts like [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1] rows instead of full collapse to borders.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated mismatched shape entirely (9 cols vs. expected 6), with extra 4-rows and misaligned 1/4 patterns (e.g., kept full all-4 row at bottom, altered [1,4,1,1,1,1] to include extras); transposition likely caused width errors, and min=3 for 4s didn't remove enough vertical empties.
 * Failed on Training 4: Generated shorter and differently shaped (e.g., 7 rows vs. expected 5, with misplaced 4-blocks like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), failing to preserve small 1-clusters or trim asymmetric 4-borders correctly; iteration stopped prematurely without stabilizing to expected collapsed form.
 * Overall, the uniform block detection works for simple cases but breaks on asymmetric or mixed patterns due to over-preservation of small blocks and incomplete propagation in columns.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the min_block=1 for 1s is too aggressive in some cases (collapses valid thin lines), while min=3 for 4s is insufficient for vertical empties in examples 2/4; no broken functions, but lack of diagonal or partial-block handling (not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it appears to have trimmed a top all-4 row (assuming input had one) and some right-side 1-clusters, revealing a striped pattern of alternating 4/1 columns in the top and a solid 1-block bottom, which could be a core "flag" or shape.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: the bottom section has repeated [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows with minor variations, suggesting incomplete removal of small vertical 4-columns (e.g., the single 4s in col 2/4/6 should perhaps form removable blocks if >=3 vertically, but weren't); expected likely more collapsed, e.g., merging the bottom 1-block fully and trimming isolated 4s, resulting in a tighter 6-8 row grid without the repetitive [1,4,1,4,1,...] stripes if they are uniform vertically.
 * Differences: Generated retains what looks like thin 4-columns (e.g., col 2 is mostly 4s but interrupted), which should be removed if all-4 vertically >=3; this mismatches potential expected by keeping "filler" stripes instead of collapsing to a solid pattern—unknown if input had 7s affecting this, but output feels under-trimmed compared to training expectations.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs (1-4), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, holes, bbox/position, pixels) that show clear, repeatable relationships across **every** train example. I ignored inconsistent or irrelevant elements (e.g., no Purple appears in any data, so no connections involving it). Isolated elements without cross-example interactions (e.g., standalone Blue pixels with no position/hole/pixel ties to others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are included. Where a transformation or effect cannot be clearly explained via consistent properties, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Dark Red color → Removal (consistent across all outputs)**:  
   Dark Red elements (always holes=0, low pixels=1-3, small bbox like single points or short lines) appear in every input but are completely absent in every output. This implies a direct interaction where Dark Red is removed or transformed, affecting overall structure. No residual Dark Red properties (e.g., position or pixels) persist unchanged. Unknown: Exact mechanism of removal (e.g., no consistent pixel transfer to Blue or Yellow).

2. **Dark Red position (bbox y-coordinate) → Blue position adjustment (bbox shift or extension)**:  
   In every input, Dark Red bbox y-positions (e.g., y=0-1 in Train 1, y=6 in Train 2, y=3-5 in Train 3, y=4-5 in Train 4) correlate with nearby changes in Blue bbox y-positions in the corresponding output (e.g., new/extended Blue at y=2-4 in Train 1, y=4-6 in Train 2, y=1-4 in Train 3, y=0-4 in Train 4). This suggests positional interaction where Dark Red locations trigger Blue bbox shifts or additions nearby (within 1-3 units in y). Consistent in all examples; x-positions show less uniformity (e.g., varies by canvas width). Unknown: Precise rule for shift distance or direction (e.g., always downward?).

3. **Yellow pixels (total count) ↔ Conservation across transformation**:  
   Total Yellow pixels sum to the same value in every input-output pair (Train 1: 36; Train 2: 20; Train 3: 16; Train 4: 22). This indicates an interaction where Yellow pixel mass is preserved, possibly through redistribution or filling. Individual Yellow components may split/merge, but aggregate remains fixed. No interaction with Dark Red pixels (which do not transfer to Yellow consistently).

4. **Yellow holes (count=1 per component) → Merging into higher-hole Yellow (position-dependent)**:  
   In every input, primary Yellow components have holes=1 and broad bbox (e.g., covering x=0 to canvas edge, y=0 to mid-height). In outputs, these consistently consolidate into fewer (often 1) Yellow component(s) with equal or increased total holes (e.g., Train 3: two holes=1 merge to one holes=2; others maintain holes=1). Interaction tied to bbox overlap/proximity (e.g., adjacent y-ranges merge). Blue elements (see #5) often border these, suggesting indirect position-based effect. Consistent; no cases of hole reduction.

5. **Blue bbox (internal divisions) ↔ Yellow bbox (background enclosure)**:  
   Blue elements (holes=0, rectangular/L-shaped bboxes forming internal bars) consistently enclose or border Yellow components in both inputs and outputs (e.g., Blue bbox overlaps or abuts Yellow bbox edges in all examples, like [1,1,6,5] inside [0,0,7,6] in Train 1). Outputs show Blue bboxes contracting or simplifying while maintaining enclosure (e.g., pixel count decreases but spatial relation holds). This interaction affects movement/transformation of boundaries (Yellow expands into former Blue space in some cases). Consistent across all; no isolated Blue without Yellow adjacency.

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- No consistent interactions involving Dark Red → color change (e.g., to Blue or Yellow pixels; totals don't match).  
- Blue pixel counts vary unpredictably (decrease in most outputs, e.g., Train 1: 49→22), with no clear tie to Dark Red pixels or positions beyond bbox shifts (noted in #2). Unknown: Full rule for pixel loss/gain.  
- x-coordinate positions show some canvas-width dependency (e.g., edge-aligned in narrow Trains 1/3 vs. wider 4) but no universal interaction (e.g., no consistent left/right mirroring).  
- No semantic shape meanings (e.g., "L-shapes") identifiable from bbox/pixels alone; connections limited to raw properties.  
- Test inputs not analyzed for connections (task focuses on train consistency).

[2025-10-01 02:44:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s (potentially useful for hidden fillers, but untested here)."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s (helpful for detecting filler blocks, but extend to all-4s or mixed for better accuracy)."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```

```python
def remove_large_all_one_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove blocks of 3+ consecutive all-1 rows (partially helpful for vertical fillers, but broken for non-all-1 patterns, column trimming, or 2D shapes—causes mismatches in examples 1,2,4)."""
    processed = replace_sevens_to_one(grid)
    n = len(processed)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(processed[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(processed[i]):
                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < 3:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(processed[j])
        else:
            result.append(processed[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

    t = transpose(grid)
    t_processed = remove_large_all_one_row_blocks(t)
    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

                    result.append(grid[j])
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []

    w = len(grid[0])
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]
```

    t = transpose(grid)
    t_processed = remove_large_all_one_row_blocks(t, min_block)
    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle similar to simplifying a Nonogram or logic grid by removing redundant uniform blocks of filled cells (1s, including 7s treated as 1s) and empty cells (4s), focusing on large consecutive rows or columns to collapse the grid to its essential pattern without altering non-uniform or small blocks. The goal is to iteratively trim these blocks until the grid stabilizes, preserving the core visual structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 1s early, as they represent filled cells equivalent to 1s for block detection but may indicate special cases like hints or overlaps.
 * Distinguish between filled blocks (1s): remove even single all-1 rows/columns (min_block=1), as they often represent thin borders or fillers; empty blocks (4s): only remove if 3+ consecutive (min_block=3), to avoid over-trimming sparse empty areas.
 * Process iteratively in a loop (rows then columns, alternating) until dimensions stabilize, as removals can create new uniform blocks; transpose for column handling.
 * Preserve non-uniform rows/columns entirely, and small blocks (< min_block) to maintain pattern details like partial fills or edges.
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), so handle empty or uneven grids gracefully; expected outputs often show collapsed borders, revealing asymmetric or irregular core shapes.
 * Subtle: Uniform blocks must be strictly all-1 or all-4; mixed cells (e.g., 1s with 4s) block removal. In examples, top/bottom/left/right borders are often trimmed differently based on uniformity.
 * Potential over-removal: Aggressive min=1 for 1s can collapse too much if patterns have thin filled lines; under-removal happens if iteration misses propagated changes.
 * Shape mismatches in outputs indicate failures in transposition or block counting, e.g., expected grids are often shorter/wider than generated.
 * No rotation or cell-value changes beyond 7->1; focus on deletion of entire rows/columns.

(Note: Column versions via transpose are helpful but derived; no custom types needed beyond List[List[int]]. No object extraction functions were present or relevant here, as the puzzle is about grid simplification, not entity detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles 7->1 replacement and iterative row/column processing with different min_blocks, succeeding on Training 3 (exact match, likely due to balanced uniform borders).
 * Failed on Training 1: Generated kept extra 1-filled and 4-mixed rows/columns (e.g., retained bottom all-1 rows and irregular 4/1 mixes), resulting in taller/wider grid than expected; did not trim enough thin 1-blocks or propagated 4-blocks, leaving artifacts like [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1] rows instead of full collapse to borders.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated mismatched shape entirely (9 cols vs. expected 6), with extra 4-rows and misaligned 1/4 patterns (e.g., kept full all-4 row at bottom, altered [1,4,1,1,1,1] to include extras); transposition likely caused width errors, and min=3 for 4s didn't remove enough vertical empties.
 * Failed on Training 4: Generated shorter and differently shaped (e.g., 7 rows vs. expected 5, with misplaced 4-blocks like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), failing to preserve small 1-clusters or trim asymmetric 4-borders correctly; iteration stopped prematurely without stabilizing to expected collapsed form.
 * Overall, the uniform block detection works for simple cases but breaks on asymmetric or mixed patterns due to over-preservation of small blocks and incomplete propagation in columns.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the min_block=1 for 1s is too aggressive in some cases (collapses valid thin lines), while min=3 for 4s is insufficient for vertical empties in examples 2/4; no broken functions, but lack of diagonal or partial-block handling (not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it appears to have trimmed a top all-4 row (assuming input had one) and some right-side 1-clusters, revealing a striped pattern of alternating 4/1 columns in the top and a solid 1-block bottom, which could be a core "flag" or shape.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: the bottom section has repeated [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows with minor variations, suggesting incomplete removal of small vertical 4-columns (e.g., the single 4s in col 2/4/6 should perhaps form removable blocks if >=3 vertically, but weren't); expected likely more collapsed, e.g., merging the bottom 1-block fully and trimming isolated 4s, resulting in a tighter 6-8 row grid without the repetitive [1,4,1,4,1,...] stripes if they are uniform vertically.
 * Differences: Generated retains what looks like thin 4-columns (e.g., col 2 is mostly 4s but interrupted), which should be removed if all-4 vertically >=3; this mismatches potential expected by keeping "filler" stripes instead of collapsing to a solid pattern—unknown if input had 7s affecting this, but output feels under-trimmed compared to training expectations.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs (1-4), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, holes, bbox/position, pixels) that show clear, repeatable relationships across **every** train example. I ignored inconsistent or irrelevant elements (e.g., no Purple appears in any data, so no connections involving it). Isolated elements without cross-example interactions (e.g., standalone Blue pixels with no position/hole/pixel ties to others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are included. Where a transformation or effect cannot be clearly explained via consistent properties, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Dark Red color → Removal (consistent across all outputs)**:  
   Dark Red elements (always holes=0, low pixels=1-3, small bbox like single points or short lines) appear in every input but are completely absent in every output. This implies a direct interaction where Dark Red is removed or transformed, affecting overall structure. No residual Dark Red properties (e.g., position or pixels) persist unchanged. Unknown: Exact mechanism of removal (e.g., no consistent pixel transfer to Blue or Yellow).

2. **Dark Red position (bbox y-coordinate) → Blue position adjustment (bbox shift or extension)**:  
   In every input, Dark Red bbox y-positions (e.g., y=0-1 in Train 1, y=6 in Train 2, y=3-5 in Train 3, y=4-5 in Train 4) correlate with nearby changes in Blue bbox y-positions in the corresponding output (e.g., new/extended Blue at y=2-4 in Train 1, y=4-6 in Train 2, y=1-4 in Train 3, y=0-4 in Train 4). This suggests positional interaction where Dark Red locations trigger Blue bbox shifts or additions nearby (within 1-3 units in y). Consistent in all examples; x-positions show less uniformity (e.g., varies by canvas width). Unknown: Precise rule for shift distance or direction (e.g., always downward?).

3. **Yellow pixels (total count) ↔ Conservation across transformation**:  
   Total Yellow pixels sum to the same value in every input-output pair (Train 1: 36; Train 2: 20; Train 3: 16; Train 4: 22). This indicates an interaction where Yellow pixel mass is preserved, possibly through redistribution or filling. Individual Yellow components may split/merge, but aggregate remains fixed. No interaction with Dark Red pixels (which do not transfer to Yellow consistently).

4. **Yellow holes (count=1 per component) → Merging into higher-hole Yellow (position-dependent)**:  
   In every input, primary Yellow components have holes=1 and broad bbox (e.g., covering x=0 to canvas edge, y=0 to mid-height). In outputs, these consistently consolidate into fewer (often 1) Yellow component(s) with equal or increased total holes (e.g., Train 3: two holes=1 merge to one holes=2; others maintain holes=1). Interaction tied to bbox overlap/proximity (e.g., adjacent y-ranges merge). Blue elements (see #5) often border these, suggesting indirect position-based effect. Consistent; no cases of hole reduction.

5. **Blue bbox (internal divisions) ↔ Yellow bbox (background enclosure)**:  
   Blue elements (holes=0, rectangular/L-shaped bboxes forming internal bars) consistently enclose or border Yellow components in both inputs and outputs (e.g., Blue bbox overlaps or abuts Yellow bbox edges in all examples, like [1,1,6,5] inside [0,0,7,6] in Train 1). Outputs show Blue bboxes contracting or simplifying while maintaining enclosure (e.g., pixel count decreases but spatial relation holds). This interaction affects movement/transformation of boundaries (Yellow expands into former Blue space in some cases). Consistent across all; no isolated Blue without Yellow adjacency.

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- No consistent interactions involving Dark Red → color change (e.g., to Blue or Yellow pixels; totals don't match).  
- Blue pixel counts vary unpredictably (decrease in most outputs, e.g., Train 1: 49→22), with no clear tie to Dark Red pixels or positions beyond bbox shifts (noted in #2). Unknown: Full rule for pixel loss/gain.  
- x-coordinate positions show some canvas-width dependency (e.g., edge-aligned in narrow Trains 1/3 vs. wider 4) but no universal interaction (e.g., no consistent left/right mirroring).  
- No semantic shape meanings (e.g., "L-shapes") identifiable from bbox/pixels alone; connections limited to raw properties.  
- Test inputs not analyzed for connections (task focuses on train consistency).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 03:00:54] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colored pixels in a visual diagram (1 for filled blue elements to remove as filler, 4 for empty yellow background to condense, 7 for dark red elements to convert to background), with the goal of simplifying the grid by removing uniform blocks of filler or background in rows and columns while preserving the core yellow pixel structures and enclosures, often resulting in a resized grid that matches a cleaner, expected outline.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 4s first to eliminate dark red intrusions without affecting yellow positions.
 * Uniform blocks of 1s (all-1 rows/columns) represent filler blue masses that should be removed if they form large consecutive blocks, but smaller or non-uniform ones must be preserved to avoid distorting enclosures.
 * Uniform blocks of 4s (all-4 rows/columns) represent empty background that can be condensed or removed, but only larger blocks to avoid over-trimming essential spacing around yellow components.
 * Process iteratively until the grid stabilizes (no size change), alternating row and column removals to handle both directions, but order matters—removing empty rows first simplifies background before tackling filler.
 * Transposition is key for column processing, but ragged grids (uneven row lengths) need padding with 4s to avoid errors.
 * Subtlety: min_block=1 is too aggressive, removing even single uniform rows/columns, which collapses structures prematurely; higher thresholds (e.g., 2+) might preserve small details like thin borders or isolated pixels.
 * Preserve approximate yellow pixel count by selective removal—over-removal leads to mismatched shapes; enclosures (blue around yellow) should adjust but not vanish.
 * Error handling: Ensure output is a valid rectangular list-of-lists; transposition on non-rectangular grids can cause format errors if not padded properly.
 * Grids may start rectangular but become ragged after row removal, requiring re-padding or reshaping before column processing.
 * Puzzle likely aims for a "minimal bounding" or "cropped" version, removing outer/inner uniform borders but keeping internal variations that define shapes (e.g., don't remove a single 1-column if it's part of a pattern).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on iterative removal of uniform 1 and 4 blocks in rows and columns after replacing 7s, which correctly handles basic background simplification and filler removal in concept but fails due to over-aggressive min_block=1, leading to excessive trimming.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 6x10 grid with preserved internal 1s but failed to remove enough left/right columns and bottom rows, resulting in extra 4s on edges and mismatched shape (e.g., expected has 7 rows x 8 cols with cleaner borders; generated keeps irregular 1-clusters like [1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,4] instead of condensing to [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 6x8 grid that partially condenses but retains unwanted 4-columns and doesn't align rows properly (e.g., expected 7x6 with specific patterns like bottom [1,4,4,4,1,1]; generated has [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows that don't match vertical alignments, possibly due to row removal order distorting columns).
 * Training example 3: Complete failure with ERROR due to invalid grid format (likely ragged list after removals, breaking transposition; expected unknown but highlights need for rectangular output enforcement).
 * Training example 4: Generated 7x9 grid that keeps too many 4s in middle rows and doesn't extend right side properly (e.g., expected 5x12 with longer rows like [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; generated truncates to shorter widths and mismatches bottom patterns like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]).
 * Overall, the iterative loop stabilizes size but removes too much (min_block=1 collapses singles), leading to shape distortion; transposition helps but padding assumes original width, causing artifacts in processed grids.
 * Function `remove_empty_row_blocks` and similar are helpful for background but need higher min_block to avoid over-removal; `program` main loop is a good skeleton but order (rows before columns) and lack of post-processing (e.g., re-padding) cause mismatches.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., identifying connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for subtle enclosure preservation; current approach treats uniformly but ignores connectivity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x8 grid with repeating [4,1,4,1,...] patterns in top rows and denser 1s below, which does not look correct as it appears overly striped and uniform in a way that suggests over-removal of 4-blocks without condensing the overall structure—likely the result of aggressive single-row/column stripping, leaving a checkerboard-like artifact instead of a simplified shape.
 * It fails to match expected puzzle logic (mentally simulating: test input seems like a frame or enclosure with internal yellow; output should crop outer 4-borders and remove internal blue fillers, yielding a tighter 6-7x6-7 grid with preserved irregular 1-clusters, but generated keeps unnecessary 4s in columns 2,4,6 and doesn't align bottom density properly).
 * Test output mismatches by not reducing dimensions enough (stays 8x8 vs. probable smaller expected) and introduces artificial repetition (e.g., rows 1-3 identical [4,1,4,1,4,4,1,4]), indicating the iteration over-trims without merging components—does not make sense for a visual cleanup, as it looks fragmented rather than cohesive.

[2025-10-01 03:01:01] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all train inputs and outputs (and noting similar structures in test inputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that show clear, direct relationships (e.g., positional nesting, presence/absence correlations, or property influences) appearing in **every** train example. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated small Yellow blocks without nesting, variable hole count changes, pixel count shifts without clear triggers, or non-nested Blues) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., why specific pixel counts change or exact bbox adjustments occur) are noted as such rather than explained.

#### 1. **Dark Red Components → Absence in Output**
   - **Description**: Dark Red components (always holes=0, small pixels=1–3, various positions) are present in every input but completely absent in every output.
   - **Interconnection**: Their presence in input correlates with overall structural changes to Blue components (e.g., new or adjusted bboxes/pixel counts) in the output. Specific transformation mechanism (e.g., how positions map to Blue changes) is unknown but consistently tied to Dark Red locations being near modified Blue areas.
   - **Consistency**: Seen in all train pairs; no Dark Red in any output.

#### 2. **Yellow (with holes) ↔ Blue (nested positions)**
   - **Description**: Every output has at least one Yellow component with holes≥1. All Blue components in outputs have bboxes fully nested within the bbox of this holed Yellow (i.e., Blue x/y ranges are subsets of Yellow's x/y ranges).
   - **Interconnection**: Position of Blue components is directly constrained by (nested inside) the position of the Yellow component with holes. This nesting persists from input to output, where input Blues are often (but not always fully) similarly nested in holed Yellows.
   - **Consistency**: Exact nesting holds in every output (Train 1: Blues [4,2,5,3] and [1,1,6,5] inside Yellow [0,0,7,6]; Train 2: all four Blues inside Yellow [0,0,5,6]; Train 3: both Blues inside Yellow [0,0,2,5]; Train 4: all four Blues inside Yellow [0,0,11,4]). Partial nesting in inputs is near-consistent but not required for this connection.

No other connections (e.g., hole count → Blue count, Dark Red position → exact Yellow pixel change, or color → movement) are obviously consistent across every example without variability or unknowns. Test inputs show similar components (Dark Red present, Yellow/Blue with potential nesting) but no outputs provided for verification.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 03:01:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s (potentially useful for hidden fillers, but untested here)."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s (helpful for detecting filler blocks, but extend to all-4s or mixed for better accuracy)."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```

```python
def remove_large_all_one_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove blocks of 3+ consecutive all-1 rows (partially helpful for vertical fillers, but broken for non-all-1 patterns, column trimming, or 2D shapes—causes mismatches in examples 1,2,4)."""
    processed = replace_sevens_to_one(grid)
    n = len(processed)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(processed[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(processed[i]):
                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < 3:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(processed[j])
        else:
            result.append(processed[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colored pixels in a visual diagram (1 for filled blue elements to remove as filler, 4 for empty yellow background to condense, 7 for dark red elements to convert to background), with the goal of simplifying the grid by removing uniform blocks of filler or background in rows and columns while preserving the core yellow pixel structures and enclosures, often resulting in a resized grid that matches a cleaner, expected outline.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 4s first to eliminate dark red intrusions without affecting yellow positions.
 * Uniform blocks of 1s (all-1 rows/columns) represent filler blue masses that should be removed if they form large consecutive blocks, but smaller or non-uniform ones must be preserved to avoid distorting enclosures.
 * Uniform blocks of 4s (all-4 rows/columns) represent empty background that can be condensed or removed, but only larger blocks to avoid over-trimming essential spacing around yellow components.
 * Process iteratively until the grid stabilizes (no size change), alternating row and column removals to handle both directions, but order matters—removing empty rows first simplifies background before tackling filler.
 * Transposition is key for column processing, but ragged grids (uneven row lengths) need padding with 4s to avoid errors.
 * Subtlety: min_block=1 is too aggressive, removing even single uniform rows/columns, which collapses structures prematurely; higher thresholds (e.g., 2+) might preserve small details like thin borders or isolated pixels.
 * Preserve approximate yellow pixel count by selective removal—over-removal leads to mismatched shapes; enclosures (blue around yellow) should adjust but not vanish.
 * Error handling: Ensure output is a valid rectangular list-of-lists; transposition on non-rectangular grids can cause format errors if not padded properly.
 * Grids may start rectangular but become ragged after row removal, requiring re-padding or reshaping before column processing.
 * Puzzle likely aims for a "minimal bounding" or "cropped" version, removing outer/inner uniform borders but keeping internal variations that define shapes (e.g., don't remove a single 1-column if it's part of a pattern).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on iterative removal of uniform 1 and 4 blocks in rows and columns after replacing 7s, which correctly handles basic background simplification and filler removal in concept but fails due to over-aggressive min_block=1, leading to excessive trimming.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 6x10 grid with preserved internal 1s but failed to remove enough left/right columns and bottom rows, resulting in extra 4s on edges and mismatched shape (e.g., expected has 7 rows x 8 cols with cleaner borders; generated keeps irregular 1-clusters like [1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,4] instead of condensing to [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 6x8 grid that partially condenses but retains unwanted 4-columns and doesn't align rows properly (e.g., expected 7x6 with specific patterns like bottom [1,4,4,4,1,1]; generated has [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows that don't match vertical alignments, possibly due to row removal order distorting columns).
 * Training example 3: Complete failure with ERROR due to invalid grid format (likely ragged list after removals, breaking transposition; expected unknown but highlights need for rectangular output enforcement).
 * Training example 4: Generated 7x9 grid that keeps too many 4s in middle rows and doesn't extend right side properly (e.g., expected 5x12 with longer rows like [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; generated truncates to shorter widths and mismatches bottom patterns like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]).
 * Overall, the iterative loop stabilizes size but removes too much (min_block=1 collapses singles), leading to shape distortion; transposition helps but padding assumes original width, causing artifacts in processed grids.
 * Function `remove_empty_row_blocks` and similar are helpful for background but need higher min_block to avoid over-removal; `program` main loop is a good skeleton but order (rows before columns) and lack of post-processing (e.g., re-padding) cause mismatches.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., identifying connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for subtle enclosure preservation; current approach treats uniformly but ignores connectivity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x8 grid with repeating [4,1,4,1,...] patterns in top rows and denser 1s below, which does not look correct as it appears overly striped and uniform in a way that suggests over-removal of 4-blocks without condensing the overall structure—likely the result of aggressive single-row/column stripping, leaving a checkerboard-like artifact instead of a simplified shape.
 * It fails to match expected puzzle logic (mentally simulating: test input seems like a frame or enclosure with internal yellow; output should crop outer 4-borders and remove internal blue fillers, yielding a tighter 6-7x6-7 grid with preserved irregular 1-clusters, but generated keeps unnecessary 4s in columns 2,4,6 and doesn't align bottom density properly).
 * Test output mismatches by not reducing dimensions enough (stays 8x8 vs. probable smaller expected) and introduces artificial repetition (e.g., rows 1-3 identical [4,1,4,1,4,4,1,4]), indicating the iteration over-trims without merging components—does not make sense for a visual cleanup, as it looks fragmented rather than cohesive.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle similar to simplifying a Nonogram or logic grid by removing redundant uniform blocks of filled cells (1s, including 7s treated as 1s) and empty cells (4s), focusing on large consecutive rows or columns to collapse the grid to its essential pattern without altering non-uniform or small blocks. The goal is to iteratively trim these blocks until the grid stabilizes, preserving the core visual structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 1s early, as they represent filled cells equivalent to 1s for block detection but may indicate special cases like hints or overlaps.
 * Distinguish between filled blocks (1s): remove even single all-1 rows/columns (min_block=1), as they often represent thin borders or fillers; empty blocks (4s): only remove if 3+ consecutive (min_block=3), to avoid over-trimming sparse empty areas.
 * Process iteratively in a loop (rows then columns, alternating) until dimensions stabilize, as removals can create new uniform blocks; transpose for column handling.
 * Preserve non-uniform rows/columns entirely, and small blocks (< min_block) to maintain pattern details like partial fills or edges.
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), so handle empty or uneven grids gracefully; expected outputs often show collapsed borders, revealing asymmetric or irregular core shapes.
 * Subtle: Uniform blocks must be strictly all-1 or all-4; mixed cells (e.g., 1s with 4s) block removal. In examples, top/bottom/left/right borders are often trimmed differently based on uniformity.
 * Potential over-removal: Aggressive min=1 for 1s can collapse too much if patterns have thin filled lines; under-removal happens if iteration misses propagated changes.
 * Shape mismatches in outputs indicate failures in transposition or block counting, e.g., expected grids are often shorter/wider than generated.
 * No rotation or cell-value changes beyond 7->1; focus on deletion of entire rows/columns.

(Note: Column versions via transpose are helpful but derived; no custom types needed beyond List[List[int]]. No object extraction functions were present or relevant here, as the puzzle is about grid simplification, not entity detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles 7->1 replacement and iterative row/column processing with different min_blocks, succeeding on Training 3 (exact match, likely due to balanced uniform borders).
 * Failed on Training 1: Generated kept extra 1-filled and 4-mixed rows/columns (e.g., retained bottom all-1 rows and irregular 4/1 mixes), resulting in taller/wider grid than expected; did not trim enough thin 1-blocks or propagated 4-blocks, leaving artifacts like [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1] rows instead of full collapse to borders.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated mismatched shape entirely (9 cols vs. expected 6), with extra 4-rows and misaligned 1/4 patterns (e.g., kept full all-4 row at bottom, altered [1,4,1,1,1,1] to include extras); transposition likely caused width errors, and min=3 for 4s didn't remove enough vertical empties.
 * Failed on Training 4: Generated shorter and differently shaped (e.g., 7 rows vs. expected 5, with misplaced 4-blocks like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), failing to preserve small 1-clusters or trim asymmetric 4-borders correctly; iteration stopped prematurely without stabilizing to expected collapsed form.
 * Overall, the uniform block detection works for simple cases but breaks on asymmetric or mixed patterns due to over-preservation of small blocks and incomplete propagation in columns.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the min_block=1 for 1s is too aggressive in some cases (collapses valid thin lines), while min=3 for 4s is insufficient for vertical empties in examples 2/4; no broken functions, but lack of diagonal or partial-block handling (not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it appears to have trimmed a top all-4 row (assuming input had one) and some right-side 1-clusters, revealing a striped pattern of alternating 4/1 columns in the top and a solid 1-block bottom, which could be a core "flag" or shape.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: the bottom section has repeated [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows with minor variations, suggesting incomplete removal of small vertical 4-columns (e.g., the single 4s in col 2/4/6 should perhaps form removable blocks if >=3 vertically, but weren't); expected likely more collapsed, e.g., merging the bottom 1-block fully and trimming isolated 4s, resulting in a tighter 6-8 row grid without the repetitive [1,4,1,4,1,...] stripes if they are uniform vertically.
 * Differences: Generated retains what looks like thin 4-columns (e.g., col 2 is mostly 4s but interrupted), which should be removed if all-4 vertically >=3; this mismatches potential expected by keeping "filler" stripes instead of collapsing to a solid pattern—unknown if input had 7s affecting this, but output feels under-trimmed compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all train inputs and outputs (and noting similar structures in test inputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that show clear, direct relationships (e.g., positional nesting, presence/absence correlations, or property influences) appearing in **every** train example. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated small Yellow blocks without nesting, variable hole count changes, pixel count shifts without clear triggers, or non-nested Blues) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., why specific pixel counts change or exact bbox adjustments occur) are noted as such rather than explained.

#### 1. **Dark Red Components → Absence in Output**
   - **Description**: Dark Red components (always holes=0, small pixels=1–3, various positions) are present in every input but completely absent in every output.
   - **Interconnection**: Their presence in input correlates with overall structural changes to Blue components (e.g., new or adjusted bboxes/pixel counts) in the output. Specific transformation mechanism (e.g., how positions map to Blue changes) is unknown but consistently tied to Dark Red locations being near modified Blue areas.
   - **Consistency**: Seen in all train pairs; no Dark Red in any output.

#### 2. **Yellow (with holes) ↔ Blue (nested positions)**
   - **Description**: Every output has at least one Yellow component with holes≥1. All Blue components in outputs have bboxes fully nested within the bbox of this holed Yellow (i.e., Blue x/y ranges are subsets of Yellow's x/y ranges).
   - **Interconnection**: Position of Blue components is directly constrained by (nested inside) the position of the Yellow component with holes. This nesting persists from input to output, where input Blues are often (but not always fully) similarly nested in holed Yellows.
   - **Consistency**: Exact nesting holds in every output (Train 1: Blues [4,2,5,3] and [1,1,6,5] inside Yellow [0,0,7,6]; Train 2: all four Blues inside Yellow [0,0,5,6]; Train 3: both Blues inside Yellow [0,0,2,5]; Train 4: all four Blues inside Yellow [0,0,11,4]). Partial nesting in inputs is near-consistent but not required for this connection.

No other connections (e.g., hole count → Blue count, Dark Red position → exact Yellow pixel change, or color → movement) are obviously consistent across every example without variability or unknowns. Test inputs show similar components (Dark Red present, Yellow/Blue with potential nesting) but no outputs provided for verification.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

[2025-10-01 03:15:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells are represented by numbers (1 for filled, 4 for empty, 7 for special filled variants), and the goal is to iteratively remove or collapse uniform blocks of filled cells (treating 7s as 1s) in rows and columns to reveal or extract a core shape or structure, while preserving non-uniform patterns. The process stabilizes when no more changes occur, but the exact rules involve detecting and omitting entire blocks of consecutive 1s (min size 1 in the attempt) without over-removing connected components or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s must be treated as filled (1s) for block detection but may have subtle roles in connectivity or preservation (e.g., they might prevent removal in some contexts, but the attempt converts them early).
 * Blocks of consecutive all-1 rows or columns (uniform filler) are removed if they represent "empty" or redundant space, but only if they are isolated or surrounding; connected 1s in shapes should not be fully removed.
 * The process is iterative across rows and columns (requiring transposition for columns), and it must alternate until the grid dimensions stabilize to avoid infinite loops or over-trimming.
 * Grids can be ragged (uneven row lengths), so padding with 4s during transposition is necessary to handle columns properly.
 * Subtle element: Removal should preserve the relative positions of non-uniform rows/columns, but the attempt over-removes in some cases, leaving extra 1s or failing to collapse shapes fully (e.g., not accounting for diagonal or partial connections).
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs often have trimmed borders (all-4 rows/columns removed) but retain irregular shapes; uniform 1-blocks are omitted only if they don't contribute to the core pattern, and grid sizes shrink accordingly.
 * Considerations from attempts: Alternate row and column processing order matters (row-first then column-first may cause asymmetries); check for stability by tracking height/width changes; avoid removing single rows if they are part of a larger structure.
 * All examples show that generated outputs retain more 1s or larger grids than expected, suggesting the removal criteria is too aggressive or doesn't detect "blocks" correctly (e.g., min_block=1 removes too much, perhaps needs min_block>1 or shape-aware detection).
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, which might be needed to identify preservable shapes vs. removable fillers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s to treat them as filled cells for block detection."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful for unifying 7s and 1s early, as seen in all examples where 7s appear.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s for detecting uniform filler blocks."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```
(Useful for identifying removable uniform rows; could be extended to check columns via transposition.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows, padding with 4s if ragged."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = max((len(row) for row in grid), default=0)
    t = [[4 for _ in range(h)] for _ in range(w)]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(min(w, len(grid[r]))):
            t[c][r] = grid[r][c]
    return t
```
(Essential for handling columns symmetrically; padding prevents index errors in ragged grids.)

The main `program` function's iterative loop (while dimensions change) is conceptually helpful for stabilization but broken in implementation (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails on 3/4 training examples by over-retaining 1s and failing to shrink the grid to match expected trimmed shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated has 7 rows x 12 cols with extra 1-blocks in bottom-left, while expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s in positions like row 4 col 8-10).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps a large all-1 block in rows 5-6 cols 9-12 and scattered 1s, but expected removes them entirely and trims right side (e.g., expected row 4: [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] vs generated [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,4,4,1]); unknown why, possibly because row removal doesn't propagate column collapses fully.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 6 rows x 9 cols with extra all-4 row and untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has extra 1s at ends), while expected is 7x6 with bottom row [1,4,4,4,1,1] and no extra width; attempt fails to remove partial column blocks or transpose back correctly.
 * Train 3 correct: The iterative removal stabilized to the exact expected shape, suggesting it works for simple cases without ragged edges or complex interconnections (no details provided, but implies uniform blocks were purely removable).
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated 7x9 with irregular 1s (e.g., row 6 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1] has extra 1 at end), while expected is 5x12 with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 0 has 12 cols with trailing 1s); attempt under-removes columns, leaving width too narrow and missing extensions.
 * The `remove_all_one_row_blocks` function is helpful but broken: It skips all consecutive all-1 rows correctly but doesn't handle partial blocks or re-check after column removal, leading to asymmetric results.
 * `remove_all_one_column_blocks` is helpful via transposition but not fully: Transposing back after processing can misalign if original was ragged, causing padding artifacts (e.g., extra 4s turning into preserved rows).
 * Overall attempt over-relies on min_block=1, which removes too aggressively in shapes but not enough in borders; no connected component analysis, so it can't distinguish filler from structure.
 * Function `program` loop is essential for iteration but incorrect: It breaks on dimension equality too early or doesn't alternate row/col enough times, leaving residual 1s.
 * No unhelpful functions to avoid yet, but the current block detection ignores 4s in mixed rows, which is fine; future attempts should add blob extraction to preserve shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows 8 rows x 10 cols with top 1 row of all 4s (likely a border not trimmed), alternating 1/4 patterns in rows 1-3 (preserved but perhaps should be collapsed if uniform columns), and a bottom block of 1s in rows 4-7 with partial 4s in row 7, but expected likely trims the top all-4 row, collapses the alternating columns (e.g., every other column is all-1s or near, which should remove to shrink width), and shapes the bottom into a more compact form without the trailing 1s in row 7 col 9-10.
 * Differences: Generated retains full 10-col width with alternating stripes (cols 1,3,5,7,9 are mostly 1s, cols 0,2,4,6,8 are 4s/1s), but puzzle rules probably require removing uniform 1-columns (e.g., col 1 might be all 1s after row removal, shrinking to 8 cols or less); bottom 1-block is over-preserved as four full 1-rows, while expected might remove some if they are filler or adjust for the partial row 7.
 * It makes partial sense (borders partially trimmed, shape vaguely visible), but fails to fully collapse the striped pattern and bottom block, suggesting the iterative loop stops prematurely or doesn't detect column uniforms after row changes; this mirrors Train 1/2/4 issues with incomplete trimming.

[2025-10-01 03:15:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s (potentially useful for hidden fillers, but untested here)."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s (helpful for detecting filler blocks, but extend to all-4s or mixed for better accuracy)."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```

```python
def remove_large_all_one_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove blocks of 3+ consecutive all-1 rows (partially helpful for vertical fillers, but broken for non-all-1 patterns, column trimming, or 2D shapes—causes mismatches in examples 1,2,4)."""
    processed = replace_sevens_to_one(grid)
    n = len(processed)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(processed[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(processed[i]):
                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < 3:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(processed[j])
        else:
            result.append(processed[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colored pixels in a visual diagram (1 for filled blue elements to remove as filler, 4 for empty yellow background to condense, 7 for dark red elements to convert to background), with the goal of simplifying the grid by removing uniform blocks of filler or background in rows and columns while preserving the core yellow pixel structures and enclosures, often resulting in a resized grid that matches a cleaner, expected outline.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 4s first to eliminate dark red intrusions without affecting yellow positions.
 * Uniform blocks of 1s (all-1 rows/columns) represent filler blue masses that should be removed if they form large consecutive blocks, but smaller or non-uniform ones must be preserved to avoid distorting enclosures.
 * Uniform blocks of 4s (all-4 rows/columns) represent empty background that can be condensed or removed, but only larger blocks to avoid over-trimming essential spacing around yellow components.
 * Process iteratively until the grid stabilizes (no size change), alternating row and column removals to handle both directions, but order matters—removing empty rows first simplifies background before tackling filler.
 * Transposition is key for column processing, but ragged grids (uneven row lengths) need padding with 4s to avoid errors.
 * Subtlety: min_block=1 is too aggressive, removing even single uniform rows/columns, which collapses structures prematurely; higher thresholds (e.g., 2+) might preserve small details like thin borders or isolated pixels.
 * Preserve approximate yellow pixel count by selective removal—over-removal leads to mismatched shapes; enclosures (blue around yellow) should adjust but not vanish.
 * Error handling: Ensure output is a valid rectangular list-of-lists; transposition on non-rectangular grids can cause format errors if not padded properly.
 * Grids may start rectangular but become ragged after row removal, requiring re-padding or reshaping before column processing.
 * Puzzle likely aims for a "minimal bounding" or "cropped" version, removing outer/inner uniform borders but keeping internal variations that define shapes (e.g., don't remove a single 1-column if it's part of a pattern).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on iterative removal of uniform 1 and 4 blocks in rows and columns after replacing 7s, which correctly handles basic background simplification and filler removal in concept but fails due to over-aggressive min_block=1, leading to excessive trimming.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 6x10 grid with preserved internal 1s but failed to remove enough left/right columns and bottom rows, resulting in extra 4s on edges and mismatched shape (e.g., expected has 7 rows x 8 cols with cleaner borders; generated keeps irregular 1-clusters like [1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,4] instead of condensing to [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 6x8 grid that partially condenses but retains unwanted 4-columns and doesn't align rows properly (e.g., expected 7x6 with specific patterns like bottom [1,4,4,4,1,1]; generated has [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows that don't match vertical alignments, possibly due to row removal order distorting columns).
 * Training example 3: Complete failure with ERROR due to invalid grid format (likely ragged list after removals, breaking transposition; expected unknown but highlights need for rectangular output enforcement).
 * Training example 4: Generated 7x9 grid that keeps too many 4s in middle rows and doesn't extend right side properly (e.g., expected 5x12 with longer rows like [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; generated truncates to shorter widths and mismatches bottom patterns like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]).
 * Overall, the iterative loop stabilizes size but removes too much (min_block=1 collapses singles), leading to shape distortion; transposition helps but padding assumes original width, causing artifacts in processed grids.
 * Function `remove_empty_row_blocks` and similar are helpful for background but need higher min_block to avoid over-removal; `program` main loop is a good skeleton but order (rows before columns) and lack of post-processing (e.g., re-padding) cause mismatches.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., identifying connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for subtle enclosure preservation; current approach treats uniformly but ignores connectivity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x8 grid with repeating [4,1,4,1,...] patterns in top rows and denser 1s below, which does not look correct as it appears overly striped and uniform in a way that suggests over-removal of 4-blocks without condensing the overall structure—likely the result of aggressive single-row/column stripping, leaving a checkerboard-like artifact instead of a simplified shape.
 * It fails to match expected puzzle logic (mentally simulating: test input seems like a frame or enclosure with internal yellow; output should crop outer 4-borders and remove internal blue fillers, yielding a tighter 6-7x6-7 grid with preserved irregular 1-clusters, but generated keeps unnecessary 4s in columns 2,4,6 and doesn't align bottom density properly).
 * Test output mismatches by not reducing dimensions enough (stays 8x8 vs. probable smaller expected) and introduces artificial repetition (e.g., rows 1-3 identical [4,1,4,1,4,4,1,4]), indicating the iteration over-trims without merging components—does not make sense for a visual cleanup, as it looks fragmented rather than cohesive.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells are represented by numbers (1 for filled, 4 for empty, 7 for special filled variants), and the goal is to iteratively remove or collapse uniform blocks of filled cells (treating 7s as 1s) in rows and columns to reveal or extract a core shape or structure, while preserving non-uniform patterns. The process stabilizes when no more changes occur, but the exact rules involve detecting and omitting entire blocks of consecutive 1s (min size 1 in the attempt) without over-removing connected components or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s must be treated as filled (1s) for block detection but may have subtle roles in connectivity or preservation (e.g., they might prevent removal in some contexts, but the attempt converts them early).
 * Blocks of consecutive all-1 rows or columns (uniform filler) are removed if they represent "empty" or redundant space, but only if they are isolated or surrounding; connected 1s in shapes should not be fully removed.
 * The process is iterative across rows and columns (requiring transposition for columns), and it must alternate until the grid dimensions stabilize to avoid infinite loops or over-trimming.
 * Grids can be ragged (uneven row lengths), so padding with 4s during transposition is necessary to handle columns properly.
 * Subtle element: Removal should preserve the relative positions of non-uniform rows/columns, but the attempt over-removes in some cases, leaving extra 1s or failing to collapse shapes fully (e.g., not accounting for diagonal or partial connections).
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs often have trimmed borders (all-4 rows/columns removed) but retain irregular shapes; uniform 1-blocks are omitted only if they don't contribute to the core pattern, and grid sizes shrink accordingly.
 * Considerations from attempts: Alternate row and column processing order matters (row-first then column-first may cause asymmetries); check for stability by tracking height/width changes; avoid removing single rows if they are part of a larger structure.
 * All examples show that generated outputs retain more 1s or larger grids than expected, suggesting the removal criteria is too aggressive or doesn't detect "blocks" correctly (e.g., min_block=1 removes too much, perhaps needs min_block>1 or shape-aware detection).
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, which might be needed to identify preservable shapes vs. removable fillers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s to treat them as filled cells for block detection."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful for unifying 7s and 1s early, as seen in all examples where 7s appear.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s for detecting uniform filler blocks."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```
(Useful for identifying removable uniform rows; could be extended to check columns via transposition.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows, padding with 4s if ragged."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = max((len(row) for row in grid), default=0)
    t = [[4 for _ in range(h)] for _ in range(w)]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(min(w, len(grid[r]))):
            t[c][r] = grid[r][c]
    return t
```
(Essential for handling columns symmetrically; padding prevents index errors in ragged grids.)

The main `program` function's iterative loop (while dimensions change) is conceptually helpful for stabilization but broken in implementation (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails on 3/4 training examples by over-retaining 1s and failing to shrink the grid to match expected trimmed shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated has 7 rows x 12 cols with extra 1-blocks in bottom-left, while expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s in positions like row 4 col 8-10).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps a large all-1 block in rows 5-6 cols 9-12 and scattered 1s, but expected removes them entirely and trims right side (e.g., expected row 4: [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] vs generated [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,4,4,1]); unknown why, possibly because row removal doesn't propagate column collapses fully.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 6 rows x 9 cols with extra all-4 row and untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has extra 1s at ends), while expected is 7x6 with bottom row [1,4,4,4,1,1] and no extra width; attempt fails to remove partial column blocks or transpose back correctly.
 * Train 3 correct: The iterative removal stabilized to the exact expected shape, suggesting it works for simple cases without ragged edges or complex interconnections (no details provided, but implies uniform blocks were purely removable).
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated 7x9 with irregular 1s (e.g., row 6 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1] has extra 1 at end), while expected is 5x12 with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 0 has 12 cols with trailing 1s); attempt under-removes columns, leaving width too narrow and missing extensions.
 * The `remove_all_one_row_blocks` function is helpful but broken: It skips all consecutive all-1 rows correctly but doesn't handle partial blocks or re-check after column removal, leading to asymmetric results.
 * `remove_all_one_column_blocks` is helpful via transposition but not fully: Transposing back after processing can misalign if original was ragged, causing padding artifacts (e.g., extra 4s turning into preserved rows).
 * Overall attempt over-relies on min_block=1, which removes too aggressively in shapes but not enough in borders; no connected component analysis, so it can't distinguish filler from structure.
 * Function `program` loop is essential for iteration but incorrect: It breaks on dimension equality too early or doesn't alternate row/col enough times, leaving residual 1s.
 * No unhelpful functions to avoid yet, but the current block detection ignores 4s in mixed rows, which is fine; future attempts should add blob extraction to preserve shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows 8 rows x 10 cols with top 1 row of all 4s (likely a border not trimmed), alternating 1/4 patterns in rows 1-3 (preserved but perhaps should be collapsed if uniform columns), and a bottom block of 1s in rows 4-7 with partial 4s in row 7, but expected likely trims the top all-4 row, collapses the alternating columns (e.g., every other column is all-1s or near, which should remove to shrink width), and shapes the bottom into a more compact form without the trailing 1s in row 7 col 9-10.
 * Differences: Generated retains full 10-col width with alternating stripes (cols 1,3,5,7,9 are mostly 1s, cols 0,2,4,6,8 are 4s/1s), but puzzle rules probably require removing uniform 1-columns (e.g., col 1 might be all 1s after row removal, shrinking to 8 cols or less); bottom 1-block is over-preserved as four full 1-rows, while expected might remove some if they are filler or adjust for the partial row 7.
 * It makes partial sense (borders partially trimmed, shape vaguely visible), but fails to fully collapse the striped pattern and bottom block, suggesting the iterative loop stops prematurely or doesn't detect column uniforms after row changes; this mirrors Train 1/2/4 issues with incomplete trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle similar to simplifying a Nonogram or logic grid by removing redundant uniform blocks of filled cells (1s, including 7s treated as 1s) and empty cells (4s), focusing on large consecutive rows or columns to collapse the grid to its essential pattern without altering non-uniform or small blocks. The goal is to iteratively trim these blocks until the grid stabilizes, preserving the core visual structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 1s early, as they represent filled cells equivalent to 1s for block detection but may indicate special cases like hints or overlaps.
 * Distinguish between filled blocks (1s): remove even single all-1 rows/columns (min_block=1), as they often represent thin borders or fillers; empty blocks (4s): only remove if 3+ consecutive (min_block=3), to avoid over-trimming sparse empty areas.
 * Process iteratively in a loop (rows then columns, alternating) until dimensions stabilize, as removals can create new uniform blocks; transpose for column handling.
 * Preserve non-uniform rows/columns entirely, and small blocks (< min_block) to maintain pattern details like partial fills or edges.
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), so handle empty or uneven grids gracefully; expected outputs often show collapsed borders, revealing asymmetric or irregular core shapes.
 * Subtle: Uniform blocks must be strictly all-1 or all-4; mixed cells (e.g., 1s with 4s) block removal. In examples, top/bottom/left/right borders are often trimmed differently based on uniformity.
 * Potential over-removal: Aggressive min=1 for 1s can collapse too much if patterns have thin filled lines; under-removal happens if iteration misses propagated changes.
 * Shape mismatches in outputs indicate failures in transposition or block counting, e.g., expected grids are often shorter/wider than generated.
 * No rotation or cell-value changes beyond 7->1; focus on deletion of entire rows/columns.

(Note: Column versions via transpose are helpful but derived; no custom types needed beyond List[List[int]]. No object extraction functions were present or relevant here, as the puzzle is about grid simplification, not entity detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles 7->1 replacement and iterative row/column processing with different min_blocks, succeeding on Training 3 (exact match, likely due to balanced uniform borders).
 * Failed on Training 1: Generated kept extra 1-filled and 4-mixed rows/columns (e.g., retained bottom all-1 rows and irregular 4/1 mixes), resulting in taller/wider grid than expected; did not trim enough thin 1-blocks or propagated 4-blocks, leaving artifacts like [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1] rows instead of full collapse to borders.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated mismatched shape entirely (9 cols vs. expected 6), with extra 4-rows and misaligned 1/4 patterns (e.g., kept full all-4 row at bottom, altered [1,4,1,1,1,1] to include extras); transposition likely caused width errors, and min=3 for 4s didn't remove enough vertical empties.
 * Failed on Training 4: Generated shorter and differently shaped (e.g., 7 rows vs. expected 5, with misplaced 4-blocks like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), failing to preserve small 1-clusters or trim asymmetric 4-borders correctly; iteration stopped prematurely without stabilizing to expected collapsed form.
 * Overall, the uniform block detection works for simple cases but breaks on asymmetric or mixed patterns due to over-preservation of small blocks and incomplete propagation in columns.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the min_block=1 for 1s is too aggressive in some cases (collapses valid thin lines), while min=3 for 4s is insufficient for vertical empties in examples 2/4; no broken functions, but lack of diagonal or partial-block handling (not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it appears to have trimmed a top all-4 row (assuming input had one) and some right-side 1-clusters, revealing a striped pattern of alternating 4/1 columns in the top and a solid 1-block bottom, which could be a core "flag" or shape.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: the bottom section has repeated [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows with minor variations, suggesting incomplete removal of small vertical 4-columns (e.g., the single 4s in col 2/4/6 should perhaps form removable blocks if >=3 vertically, but weren't); expected likely more collapsed, e.g., merging the bottom 1-block fully and trimming isolated 4s, resulting in a tighter 6-8 row grid without the repetitive [1,4,1,4,1,...] stripes if they are uniform vertically.
 * Differences: Generated retains what looks like thin 4-columns (e.g., col 2 is mostly 4s but interrupted), which should be removed if all-4 vertically >=3; this mismatches potential expected by keeping "filler" stripes instead of collapsing to a solid pattern—unknown if input had 7s affecting this, but output feels under-trimmed compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 03:25:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving a 2D list of integers (primarily 1s, 4s, and possibly 7s), where the goal is to process the grid by replacing 7s with 4s and then iteratively removing or collapsing short uniform blocks of rows and columns consisting entirely of 1s or 4s, based on minimum length thresholds, until the grid stabilizes, resulting in a "collapsed" or simplified version that matches expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace all 7s with 4s at the start, as 7s appear to be a temporary or alias marker for 4s in the puzzle logic.
 * Identify and remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 1s, but only if the block length is below a minimum threshold (e.g., <2 in the attempt, but this may be incorrect based on failures).
 * Similarly, remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 4s if below a different minimum threshold (e.g., <3 in the attempt, potentially wrong).
 * Apply the same logic to columns by transposing the grid, processing, and transposing back, to handle vertical blocks.
 * Iterate the row and column removal process in a loop until no further changes occur (e.g., grid dimensions stabilize).
 * Subtlety: Removals should effectively "collapse" the grid by bringing remaining parts together, but the attempt's logic keeps short blocks instead of removing them— this inversion (keeping short vs. removing long/short) may be a key error, as expected outputs show more aggressive removal of patterns.
 * Subtlety: Thresholds may vary or be different (e.g., remove 1-blocks if >=2 or < some value; the attempt's min_block=2 for 1s and 3 for 4s leads to incomplete collapses, leaving extra 1s/4s).
 * Order matters: The attempt processes rows first, then columns via transpose, but alternating or repeating more finely might be needed; also, changes propagate (e.g., removing a row can create new uniform columns).
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), and empty grids or single cells need handling (attempt assumes non-empty).
 * Potential miss: Not all uniform blocks are rows/columns—perhaps diagonal or irregular shapes, but evidence suggests only full row/column uniforms.
 * After replacement, only 1s and 4s remain, so logic focuses on those; other numbers (if any) are preserved.
 * Loop termination via dimension check is good, but attempt's while loop may over- or under-process due to wrong removal criteria.
 * Expected outputs are smaller/simpler, suggesting removals eliminate more than the attempt does (e.g., short blocks are kept, but should be removed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_four(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[4 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful and correct for initial processing, as 7s consistently become 4s in examples.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)

def is_all_four(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(cell == 4 for cell in row)
```
(These are basic and useful for detecting uniform rows; could extend to columns directly.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]
```
(This is essential and correct for handling columns symmetrically.)

```python
def remove_all_one_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Note: This keeps short blocks; may need inversion to remove them
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result

def remove_all_four_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_four(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_four(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Same note: Keeps short; likely should remove short/long differently
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```
(These are helpful for block detection but flawed in action: they append short blocks to result (keeping them) while skipping long ones (effectively removing long), which is inverted from likely intent—expected outputs remove more, suggesting remove if < min_block. Adapt for columns via transpose.)

(The overall program structure with iteration until no change is a good skeleton, but thresholds and keep/remove logic need fixing; no object extraction needed, as it's grid-level processing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it failed all 4 training examples due to incomplete removals, leaving extra rows/columns of 1s and 4s that should have been collapsed.
 * Train 1: Generated a 7x13 grid with scattered 1s in lower rows (e.g., row 6 has [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1]), but expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s (e.g., row 6 is all 4s except positions matching a pattern); difference: attempt kept short 1-blocks and didn't propagate column removals fully, leaving dangling 1s on the right.
 * Train 2: Generated 7x9 with extra full 4-rows and misaligned 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1]), but expected 7x6 with tighter pattern (e.g., row 6 [1,4,1,4,1,1]); difference: over-kept 4-blocks and didn't remove short 1-columns, resulting in wider grid and wrong positions.
 * Train 3: Generated 9x3 with extra all-1 and all-4 rows (e.g., rows 4-5 all 4s kept, row 5 [1,1,1] kept), but expected 6x3 with only specific [4,1,4] and all-4 rows; difference: kept short uniform blocks instead of removing them, adding unnecessary rows and failing to collapse vertically.
 * Train 4: Generated 7x9 with fragmented 1s and 4s (e.g., row 3 [4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1], row 6 [1,1,4,1,1,1,1,4,1]), but expected 5x12 with extended patterns (e.g., row 1 ends in more 1s); difference: didn't extend or remove properly, leading to shorter/wrong-width grid and mismatched shapes (unknown why it truncated right side).
 * General issue: The keep-short/remove-long logic is backwards—likely should remove short blocks (< min) to match expectations; thresholds (2 for 1s, 3 for 4s) may be wrong (e.g., try 1 for 1s or 2 for 4s).
 * Transpose-based column handling works in concept but fails propagation in loop due to order (rows before columns each iteration).
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; pure grid processing.
 * Iteration loop detects changes via size, which is helpful but insufficient without correct removal.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x10 grid with patterned 1s and 4s (e.g., rows 2-4 have alternating 4,1 patterns; bottom has clustered 1s), but it does not look correct based on training patterns—expected likely a more collapsed version (e.g., 6-7 rows, removing short 1/4 blocks to tighten the checkerboard-like top and 1-clusters bottom).
 * It keeps what appear to be short uniform segments (e.g., potential short all-4 columns on left not removed), leading to a taller/wider grid than expected; top rows 1-4 suggest incomplete column collapses (alternating should propagate to remove isolated 1s vertically).
 * Bottom rows 5-9 have irregular 1-blocks that weren't fully removed, unlike training where similar clusters collapse more (e.g., Train 1 removes dangling 1s); this mismatches by preserving too much, suggesting same inversion error as training (keeps short blocks).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense as a pre-collapse state but not final—likely incorrect, as it doesn't simplify to a minimal stable grid; to handle test, invert removal logic and tune thresholds (e.g., remove 1-blocks <3, 4-blocks <2) for better propagation in alternating patterns.

[2025-10-01 03:25:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < 3:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(processed[j])
        else:
            result.append(processed[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colored pixels in a visual diagram (1 for filled blue elements to remove as filler, 4 for empty yellow background to condense, 7 for dark red elements to convert to background), with the goal of simplifying the grid by removing uniform blocks of filler or background in rows and columns while preserving the core yellow pixel structures and enclosures, often resulting in a resized grid that matches a cleaner, expected outline.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 4s first to eliminate dark red intrusions without affecting yellow positions.
 * Uniform blocks of 1s (all-1 rows/columns) represent filler blue masses that should be removed if they form large consecutive blocks, but smaller or non-uniform ones must be preserved to avoid distorting enclosures.
 * Uniform blocks of 4s (all-4 rows/columns) represent empty background that can be condensed or removed, but only larger blocks to avoid over-trimming essential spacing around yellow components.
 * Process iteratively until the grid stabilizes (no size change), alternating row and column removals to handle both directions, but order matters—removing empty rows first simplifies background before tackling filler.
 * Transposition is key for column processing, but ragged grids (uneven row lengths) need padding with 4s to avoid errors.
 * Subtlety: min_block=1 is too aggressive, removing even single uniform rows/columns, which collapses structures prematurely; higher thresholds (e.g., 2+) might preserve small details like thin borders or isolated pixels.
 * Preserve approximate yellow pixel count by selective removal—over-removal leads to mismatched shapes; enclosures (blue around yellow) should adjust but not vanish.
 * Error handling: Ensure output is a valid rectangular list-of-lists; transposition on non-rectangular grids can cause format errors if not padded properly.
 * Grids may start rectangular but become ragged after row removal, requiring re-padding or reshaping before column processing.
 * Puzzle likely aims for a "minimal bounding" or "cropped" version, removing outer/inner uniform borders but keeping internal variations that define shapes (e.g., don't remove a single 1-column if it's part of a pattern).

            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on iterative removal of uniform 1 and 4 blocks in rows and columns after replacing 7s, which correctly handles basic background simplification and filler removal in concept but fails due to over-aggressive min_block=1, leading to excessive trimming.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 6x10 grid with preserved internal 1s but failed to remove enough left/right columns and bottom rows, resulting in extra 4s on edges and mismatched shape (e.g., expected has 7 rows x 8 cols with cleaner borders; generated keeps irregular 1-clusters like [1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,4] instead of condensing to [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 6x8 grid that partially condenses but retains unwanted 4-columns and doesn't align rows properly (e.g., expected 7x6 with specific patterns like bottom [1,4,4,4,1,1]; generated has [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows that don't match vertical alignments, possibly due to row removal order distorting columns).
 * Training example 3: Complete failure with ERROR due to invalid grid format (likely ragged list after removals, breaking transposition; expected unknown but highlights need for rectangular output enforcement).
 * Training example 4: Generated 7x9 grid that keeps too many 4s in middle rows and doesn't extend right side properly (e.g., expected 5x12 with longer rows like [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; generated truncates to shorter widths and mismatches bottom patterns like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]).
 * Overall, the iterative loop stabilizes size but removes too much (min_block=1 collapses singles), leading to shape distortion; transposition helps but padding assumes original width, causing artifacts in processed grids.
 * Function `remove_empty_row_blocks` and similar are helpful for background but need higher min_block to avoid over-removal; `program` main loop is a good skeleton but order (rows before columns) and lack of post-processing (e.g., re-padding) cause mismatches.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., identifying connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for subtle enclosure preservation; current approach treats uniformly but ignores connectivity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x8 grid with repeating [4,1,4,1,...] patterns in top rows and denser 1s below, which does not look correct as it appears overly striped and uniform in a way that suggests over-removal of 4-blocks without condensing the overall structure—likely the result of aggressive single-row/column stripping, leaving a checkerboard-like artifact instead of a simplified shape.
 * It fails to match expected puzzle logic (mentally simulating: test input seems like a frame or enclosure with internal yellow; output should crop outer 4-borders and remove internal blue fillers, yielding a tighter 6-7x6-7 grid with preserved irregular 1-clusters, but generated keeps unnecessary 4s in columns 2,4,6 and doesn't align bottom density properly).
 * Test output mismatches by not reducing dimensions enough (stays 8x8 vs. probable smaller expected) and introduces artificial repetition (e.g., rows 1-3 identical [4,1,4,1,4,4,1,4]), indicating the iteration over-trims without merging components—does not make sense for a visual cleanup, as it looks fragmented rather than cohesive.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells are represented by numbers (1 for filled, 4 for empty, 7 for special filled variants), and the goal is to iteratively remove or collapse uniform blocks of filled cells (treating 7s as 1s) in rows and columns to reveal or extract a core shape or structure, while preserving non-uniform patterns. The process stabilizes when no more changes occur, but the exact rules involve detecting and omitting entire blocks of consecutive 1s (min size 1 in the attempt) without over-removing connected components or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s must be treated as filled (1s) for block detection but may have subtle roles in connectivity or preservation (e.g., they might prevent removal in some contexts, but the attempt converts them early).
 * Blocks of consecutive all-1 rows or columns (uniform filler) are removed if they represent "empty" or redundant space, but only if they are isolated or surrounding; connected 1s in shapes should not be fully removed.
 * The process is iterative across rows and columns (requiring transposition for columns), and it must alternate until the grid dimensions stabilize to avoid infinite loops or over-trimming.
 * Grids can be ragged (uneven row lengths), so padding with 4s during transposition is necessary to handle columns properly.
 * Subtle element: Removal should preserve the relative positions of non-uniform rows/columns, but the attempt over-removes in some cases, leaving extra 1s or failing to collapse shapes fully (e.g., not accounting for diagonal or partial connections).
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs often have trimmed borders (all-4 rows/columns removed) but retain irregular shapes; uniform 1-blocks are omitted only if they don't contribute to the core pattern, and grid sizes shrink accordingly.
 * Considerations from attempts: Alternate row and column processing order matters (row-first then column-first may cause asymmetries); check for stability by tracking height/width changes; avoid removing single rows if they are part of a larger structure.
 * All examples show that generated outputs retain more 1s or larger grids than expected, suggesting the removal criteria is too aggressive or doesn't detect "blocks" correctly (e.g., min_block=1 removes too much, perhaps needs min_block>1 or shape-aware detection).
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, which might be needed to identify preservable shapes vs. removable fillers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s to treat them as filled cells for block detection."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful for unifying 7s and 1s early, as seen in all examples where 7s appear.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s for detecting uniform filler blocks."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```
(Useful for identifying removable uniform rows; could be extended to check columns via transposition.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows, padding with 4s if ragged."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = max((len(row) for row in grid), default=0)
    t = [[4 for _ in range(h)] for _ in range(w)]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(min(w, len(grid[r]))):
            t[c][r] = grid[r][c]
    return t
```
(Essential for handling columns symmetrically; padding prevents index errors in ragged grids.)

The main `program` function's iterative loop (while dimensions change) is conceptually helpful for stabilization but broken in implementation (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails on 3/4 training examples by over-retaining 1s and failing to shrink the grid to match expected trimmed shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated has 7 rows x 12 cols with extra 1-blocks in bottom-left, while expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s in positions like row 4 col 8-10).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps a large all-1 block in rows 5-6 cols 9-12 and scattered 1s, but expected removes them entirely and trims right side (e.g., expected row 4: [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] vs generated [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,4,4,1]); unknown why, possibly because row removal doesn't propagate column collapses fully.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 6 rows x 9 cols with extra all-4 row and untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has extra 1s at ends), while expected is 7x6 with bottom row [1,4,4,4,1,1] and no extra width; attempt fails to remove partial column blocks or transpose back correctly.
 * Train 3 correct: The iterative removal stabilized to the exact expected shape, suggesting it works for simple cases without ragged edges or complex interconnections (no details provided, but implies uniform blocks were purely removable).
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated 7x9 with irregular 1s (e.g., row 6 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1] has extra 1 at end), while expected is 5x12 with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 0 has 12 cols with trailing 1s); attempt under-removes columns, leaving width too narrow and missing extensions.
 * The `remove_all_one_row_blocks` function is helpful but broken: It skips all consecutive all-1 rows correctly but doesn't handle partial blocks or re-check after column removal, leading to asymmetric results.
 * `remove_all_one_column_blocks` is helpful via transposition but not fully: Transposing back after processing can misalign if original was ragged, causing padding artifacts (e.g., extra 4s turning into preserved rows).
 * Overall attempt over-relies on min_block=1, which removes too aggressively in shapes but not enough in borders; no connected component analysis, so it can't distinguish filler from structure.
 * Function `program` loop is essential for iteration but incorrect: It breaks on dimension equality too early or doesn't alternate row/col enough times, leaving residual 1s.
 * No unhelpful functions to avoid yet, but the current block detection ignores 4s in mixed rows, which is fine; future attempts should add blob extraction to preserve shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows 8 rows x 10 cols with top 1 row of all 4s (likely a border not trimmed), alternating 1/4 patterns in rows 1-3 (preserved but perhaps should be collapsed if uniform columns), and a bottom block of 1s in rows 4-7 with partial 4s in row 7, but expected likely trims the top all-4 row, collapses the alternating columns (e.g., every other column is all-1s or near, which should remove to shrink width), and shapes the bottom into a more compact form without the trailing 1s in row 7 col 9-10.
 * Differences: Generated retains full 10-col width with alternating stripes (cols 1,3,5,7,9 are mostly 1s, cols 0,2,4,6,8 are 4s/1s), but puzzle rules probably require removing uniform 1-columns (e.g., col 1 might be all 1s after row removal, shrinking to 8 cols or less); bottom 1-block is over-preserved as four full 1-rows, while expected might remove some if they are filler or adjust for the partial row 7.
 * It makes partial sense (borders partially trimmed, shape vaguely visible), but fails to fully collapse the striped pattern and bottom block, suggesting the iterative loop stops prematurely or doesn't detect column uniforms after row changes; this mirrors Train 1/2/4 issues with incomplete trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle similar to simplifying a Nonogram or logic grid by removing redundant uniform blocks of filled cells (1s, including 7s treated as 1s) and empty cells (4s), focusing on large consecutive rows or columns to collapse the grid to its essential pattern without altering non-uniform or small blocks. The goal is to iteratively trim these blocks until the grid stabilizes, preserving the core visual structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 1s early, as they represent filled cells equivalent to 1s for block detection but may indicate special cases like hints or overlaps.
 * Distinguish between filled blocks (1s): remove even single all-1 rows/columns (min_block=1), as they often represent thin borders or fillers; empty blocks (4s): only remove if 3+ consecutive (min_block=3), to avoid over-trimming sparse empty areas.
 * Process iteratively in a loop (rows then columns, alternating) until dimensions stabilize, as removals can create new uniform blocks; transpose for column handling.
 * Preserve non-uniform rows/columns entirely, and small blocks (< min_block) to maintain pattern details like partial fills or edges.
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), so handle empty or uneven grids gracefully; expected outputs often show collapsed borders, revealing asymmetric or irregular core shapes.
 * Subtle: Uniform blocks must be strictly all-1 or all-4; mixed cells (e.g., 1s with 4s) block removal. In examples, top/bottom/left/right borders are often trimmed differently based on uniformity.
 * Potential over-removal: Aggressive min=1 for 1s can collapse too much if patterns have thin filled lines; under-removal happens if iteration misses propagated changes.
 * Shape mismatches in outputs indicate failures in transposition or block counting, e.g., expected grids are often shorter/wider than generated.
 * No rotation or cell-value changes beyond 7->1; focus on deletion of entire rows/columns.

(Note: Column versions via transpose are helpful but derived; no custom types needed beyond List[List[int]]. No object extraction functions were present or relevant here, as the puzzle is about grid simplification, not entity detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles 7->1 replacement and iterative row/column processing with different min_blocks, succeeding on Training 3 (exact match, likely due to balanced uniform borders).
 * Failed on Training 1: Generated kept extra 1-filled and 4-mixed rows/columns (e.g., retained bottom all-1 rows and irregular 4/1 mixes), resulting in taller/wider grid than expected; did not trim enough thin 1-blocks or propagated 4-blocks, leaving artifacts like [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1] rows instead of full collapse to borders.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated mismatched shape entirely (9 cols vs. expected 6), with extra 4-rows and misaligned 1/4 patterns (e.g., kept full all-4 row at bottom, altered [1,4,1,1,1,1] to include extras); transposition likely caused width errors, and min=3 for 4s didn't remove enough vertical empties.
 * Failed on Training 4: Generated shorter and differently shaped (e.g., 7 rows vs. expected 5, with misplaced 4-blocks like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), failing to preserve small 1-clusters or trim asymmetric 4-borders correctly; iteration stopped prematurely without stabilizing to expected collapsed form.
 * Overall, the uniform block detection works for simple cases but breaks on asymmetric or mixed patterns due to over-preservation of small blocks and incomplete propagation in columns.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the min_block=1 for 1s is too aggressive in some cases (collapses valid thin lines), while min=3 for 4s is insufficient for vertical empties in examples 2/4; no broken functions, but lack of diagonal or partial-block handling (not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it appears to have trimmed a top all-4 row (assuming input had one) and some right-side 1-clusters, revealing a striped pattern of alternating 4/1 columns in the top and a solid 1-block bottom, which could be a core "flag" or shape.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: the bottom section has repeated [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows with minor variations, suggesting incomplete removal of small vertical 4-columns (e.g., the single 4s in col 2/4/6 should perhaps form removable blocks if >=3 vertically, but weren't); expected likely more collapsed, e.g., merging the bottom 1-block fully and trimming isolated 4s, resulting in a tighter 6-8 row grid without the repetitive [1,4,1,4,1,...] stripes if they are uniform vertically.
 * Differences: Generated retains what looks like thin 4-columns (e.g., col 2 is mostly 4s but interrupted), which should be removed if all-4 vertically >=3; this mismatches potential expected by keeping "filler" stripes instead of collapsing to a solid pattern—unknown if input had 7s affecting this, but output feels under-trimmed compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving a 2D list of integers (primarily 1s, 4s, and possibly 7s), where the goal is to process the grid by replacing 7s with 4s and then iteratively removing or collapsing short uniform blocks of rows and columns consisting entirely of 1s or 4s, based on minimum length thresholds, until the grid stabilizes, resulting in a "collapsed" or simplified version that matches expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace all 7s with 4s at the start, as 7s appear to be a temporary or alias marker for 4s in the puzzle logic.
 * Identify and remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 1s, but only if the block length is below a minimum threshold (e.g., <2 in the attempt, but this may be incorrect based on failures).
 * Similarly, remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 4s if below a different minimum threshold (e.g., <3 in the attempt, potentially wrong).
 * Apply the same logic to columns by transposing the grid, processing, and transposing back, to handle vertical blocks.
 * Iterate the row and column removal process in a loop until no further changes occur (e.g., grid dimensions stabilize).
 * Subtlety: Removals should effectively "collapse" the grid by bringing remaining parts together, but the attempt's logic keeps short blocks instead of removing them— this inversion (keeping short vs. removing long/short) may be a key error, as expected outputs show more aggressive removal of patterns.
 * Subtlety: Thresholds may vary or be different (e.g., remove 1-blocks if >=2 or < some value; the attempt's min_block=2 for 1s and 3 for 4s leads to incomplete collapses, leaving extra 1s/4s).
 * Order matters: The attempt processes rows first, then columns via transpose, but alternating or repeating more finely might be needed; also, changes propagate (e.g., removing a row can create new uniform columns).
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), and empty grids or single cells need handling (attempt assumes non-empty).
 * Potential miss: Not all uniform blocks are rows/columns—perhaps diagonal or irregular shapes, but evidence suggests only full row/column uniforms.
 * After replacement, only 1s and 4s remain, so logic focuses on those; other numbers (if any) are preserved.
 * Loop termination via dimension check is good, but attempt's while loop may over- or under-process due to wrong removal criteria.
 * Expected outputs are smaller/simpler, suggesting removals eliminate more than the attempt does (e.g., short blocks are kept, but should be removed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_four(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[4 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful and correct for initial processing, as 7s consistently become 4s in examples.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)

def is_all_four(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(cell == 4 for cell in row)
```
(These are basic and useful for detecting uniform rows; could extend to columns directly.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]
```
(This is essential and correct for handling columns symmetrically.)

```python
def remove_all_one_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Note: This keeps short blocks; may need inversion to remove them
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result

def remove_all_four_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_four(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_four(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Same note: Keeps short; likely should remove short/long differently
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```
(These are helpful for block detection but flawed in action: they append short blocks to result (keeping them) while skipping long ones (effectively removing long), which is inverted from likely intent—expected outputs remove more, suggesting remove if < min_block. Adapt for columns via transpose.)

(The overall program structure with iteration until no change is a good skeleton, but thresholds and keep/remove logic need fixing; no object extraction needed, as it's grid-level processing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it failed all 4 training examples due to incomplete removals, leaving extra rows/columns of 1s and 4s that should have been collapsed.
 * Train 1: Generated a 7x13 grid with scattered 1s in lower rows (e.g., row 6 has [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1]), but expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s (e.g., row 6 is all 4s except positions matching a pattern); difference: attempt kept short 1-blocks and didn't propagate column removals fully, leaving dangling 1s on the right.
 * Train 2: Generated 7x9 with extra full 4-rows and misaligned 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1]), but expected 7x6 with tighter pattern (e.g., row 6 [1,4,1,4,1,1]); difference: over-kept 4-blocks and didn't remove short 1-columns, resulting in wider grid and wrong positions.
 * Train 3: Generated 9x3 with extra all-1 and all-4 rows (e.g., rows 4-5 all 4s kept, row 5 [1,1,1] kept), but expected 6x3 with only specific [4,1,4] and all-4 rows; difference: kept short uniform blocks instead of removing them, adding unnecessary rows and failing to collapse vertically.
 * Train 4: Generated 7x9 with fragmented 1s and 4s (e.g., row 3 [4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1], row 6 [1,1,4,1,1,1,1,4,1]), but expected 5x12 with extended patterns (e.g., row 1 ends in more 1s); difference: didn't extend or remove properly, leading to shorter/wrong-width grid and mismatched shapes (unknown why it truncated right side).
 * General issue: The keep-short/remove-long logic is backwards—likely should remove short blocks (< min) to match expectations; thresholds (2 for 1s, 3 for 4s) may be wrong (e.g., try 1 for 1s or 2 for 4s).
 * Transpose-based column handling works in concept but fails propagation in loop due to order (rows before columns each iteration).
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; pure grid processing.
 * Iteration loop detects changes via size, which is helpful but insufficient without correct removal.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x10 grid with patterned 1s and 4s (e.g., rows 2-4 have alternating 4,1 patterns; bottom has clustered 1s), but it does not look correct based on training patterns—expected likely a more collapsed version (e.g., 6-7 rows, removing short 1/4 blocks to tighten the checkerboard-like top and 1-clusters bottom).
 * It keeps what appear to be short uniform segments (e.g., potential short all-4 columns on left not removed), leading to a taller/wider grid than expected; top rows 1-4 suggest incomplete column collapses (alternating should propagate to remove isolated 1s vertically).
 * Bottom rows 5-9 have irregular 1-blocks that weren't fully removed, unlike training where similar clusters collapse more (e.g., Train 1 removes dangling 1s); this mismatches by preserving too much, suggesting same inversion error as training (keeps short blocks).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense as a pre-collapse state but not final—likely incorrect, as it doesn't simplify to a minimal stable grid; to handle test, invert removal logic and tune thresholds (e.g., remove 1-blocks <3, 4-blocks <2) for better propagation in alternating patterns.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-10-01 03:36:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells represented by numbers (likely 1 and 7 as filled variants, 4 as empty), where the goal is to process the grid by removing large uniform blocks of filled rows/columns and trimming extraneous parts to reveal a simplified or "core" shape that matches expected outputs. The rules emphasize iterative simplification while preserving small filled blocks and handling special cases like 7s differently from 1s before final trimming.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Filled cells are 1 or 7, but 7s must be replaced with 4s (empty) only after block removal, as they initially count as filled for block detection but become empty for trimming.
 * Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive all-filled rows (or columns via transpose), but preserve smaller blocks (1-2 rows) and any non-filled rows; this must be done iteratively until no changes occur, alternating between rows and columns.
 * After block removal, replace all remaining 7s with 4s to treat them as empty, then find the leftmost column that is entirely 1s (now ignoring 7s) and trim all columns from that point to the right, keeping only the left portion.
 * Grids may not be square; transposing handles column processing, but ensure dimensions are tracked to detect convergence.
 * Subtle: All-1 columns for trimming are checked post-7 replacement, so original 7s in a column don't block it from being all-1 if they become 4s; however, if a column has mixed 1s and 7s, it won't be all-1 after replacement.
 * Easy to miss: The process is compositional—block removal first (iterative with transpose), then 7-to-4 replacement, then trim; skipping iteration or wrong order leads to over-removal or incomplete trimming.
 * Outputs must match exactly in shape and values; even small mismatches (e.g., extra columns or wrong cell values) fail.
 * No removal of small filled blocks or non-uniform rows; preserve patterns like isolated 1s or short filled segments.
 * Consider rectangular grids; trimming can change width but not height unless block removal affects rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_all_filled(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of filled cells (1 or 7)."""
    return all(cell == 1 or cell == 7 for cell in row)

def remove_large_all_filled_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove blocks of min_block or more consecutive all-filled rows, preserving smaller blocks and non-filled rows."""
    if not grid:
        return []
    n = len(grid)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if is_all_filled(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_filled(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < min_block:
                result.extend(grid[start:i])
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result

def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid (assumes rectangular input)."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0])
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]
```
These functions are helpful for block removal and transposition; they correctly identify and preserve small filled blocks while enabling column processing.

```python
def replace_sevens_to_four(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 4s."""
    return [[4 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]

def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)

def find_first_all_one_column(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Find the index of the leftmost all-1 column, or len if none."""
    h = len(grid)
    if h == 0:
        return 0
    w = len(grid[0])
    for c in range(w):
        if all(grid[r][c] == 1 for r in range(h)):
            return c
    return w

def trim_right_from_first_all_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Trim columns from the first all-1 column to the end (after replacing 7s to 4s)."""
    grid = replace_sevens_to_four(grid)
    first = find_first_all_one_column(grid)
    return [row[:first] for row in grid]
```
These are useful for post-processing: 7-to-4 replacement and all-1 column detection/trimming; they handle the final simplification step accurately when applied in order.

```python
def process_filled_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove large all-filled row blocks iteratively, including via transposition for columns (min_block=3)."""
    current = grid
    while True:
        old_h = len(current)
        old_w = len(current[0]) if current else 0
        current = remove_large_all_filled_row_blocks(current, 3)
        t = transpose(current)
        t = remove_large_all_filled_row_blocks(t, 3)
        current = transpose(t)
        new_h = len(current)
        new_w = len(current[0]) if current else 0
        if new_h == old_h and new_w == old_w:
            break
    return current
```
This iterative block removal function is helpful but must be applied before trimming; it converges correctly but can over-remove if not preserving small blocks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented iterative block removal (rows and columns via transpose), 7-to-4 replacement, and right-trimming from the first all-1 column, which worked correctly for Training example 3 (exact match, preserving the core shape without over-trimming).
 * For Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x8 grid with extra 1s in rows 2-6 (e.g., positions 3-7 in row 2 are 1s instead of 4s/1s mix), and mismatched patterns like row 3 having all 1s from col 2-7 vs. expected sparse 1s; this suggests block removal didn't preserve small filled segments properly, or trimming cut too early/left too much.
 * For Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid retaining extra columns (e.g., last column all 1s/4s not trimmed), and row 1 has extra 1 and 4 at end vs. expected 7x6 with trimmed width; block removal likely failed to eliminate a large filled row block (row 2 all 4s? but miscounted as filled), leading to wider output.
 * For Training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid with incomplete trimming (e.g., extra columns 9-? with 1s/4s), and row 3 has 4s in cols 5-6 instead of 1s, row 5 mismatches in col 7 (1 vs. 4); suggests transpose iteration didn't remove a vertical filled block, or 7 replacement happened too early, altering all-1 detection.
 * Overall, the attempt correctly composed the steps but failed on iteration convergence (didn't remove all large blocks in transposed views) and trimming (found wrong first all-1 column due to lingering 7s or unremoved blocks); no object extraction functions were used, but they aren't relevant here—this is grid-wide processing, not object isolation.
 * Function `process_filled_row_blocks` is helpful but broken in non-convergence for complex grids (e.g., alternating row/column blocks); `trim_right_from_first_all_one` is mostly correct but assumes post-replacement, which works if blocks are fully removed first.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the full `program` composition is flawed due to order/timing issues in applying steps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x10 grid that appears over-wide and untrimmed (e.g., columns 8-10 have patterns like 4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 that look like extraneous filled extensions, and no clear all-1 column was trimmed from).
 * It does not look correct: The top rows (1-4) show a checkerboard-like 4/1 pattern extending fully to col 10, but expected likely trims after a left-aligned all-1 column (possibly col 2 or 4, based on vertical 1s in cols 2,4,6,8), resulting in a narrower grid (e.g., 8x4 or 8x6) with preserved bottom filled block; current output retains right-side noise, suggesting trimming failed to detect the first all-1 column post-7 replacement (no 7s visible, but maybe block removal missed a vertical filled block).
 * Bottom rows (5-8) have a solid 1-block from col 3 onward, which might be a preserved small block, but the overall shape doesn't simplify to a "core" puzzle element—likely missing iterative column removal of large 1/7 blocks on the right.
 * To handle the test, ensure transpose removes any large vertical filled blocks (e.g., cols 2/4/6/8 might form partial blocks <3, but right side could have >=3), then trim precisely from the leftmost post-replacement all-1 column.

[2025-10-01 03:36:17] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(processed[j])
        else:
            result.append(processed[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colored pixels in a visual diagram (1 for filled blue elements to remove as filler, 4 for empty yellow background to condense, 7 for dark red elements to convert to background), with the goal of simplifying the grid by removing uniform blocks of filler or background in rows and columns while preserving the core yellow pixel structures and enclosures, often resulting in a resized grid that matches a cleaner, expected outline.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 4s first to eliminate dark red intrusions without affecting yellow positions.
 * Uniform blocks of 1s (all-1 rows/columns) represent filler blue masses that should be removed if they form large consecutive blocks, but smaller or non-uniform ones must be preserved to avoid distorting enclosures.
 * Uniform blocks of 4s (all-4 rows/columns) represent empty background that can be condensed or removed, but only larger blocks to avoid over-trimming essential spacing around yellow components.
 * Process iteratively until the grid stabilizes (no size change), alternating row and column removals to handle both directions, but order matters—removing empty rows first simplifies background before tackling filler.
 * Transposition is key for column processing, but ragged grids (uneven row lengths) need padding with 4s to avoid errors.
 * Subtlety: min_block=1 is too aggressive, removing even single uniform rows/columns, which collapses structures prematurely; higher thresholds (e.g., 2+) might preserve small details like thin borders or isolated pixels.
 * Preserve approximate yellow pixel count by selective removal—over-removal leads to mismatched shapes; enclosures (blue around yellow) should adjust but not vanish.
 * Error handling: Ensure output is a valid rectangular list-of-lists; transposition on non-rectangular grids can cause format errors if not padded properly.
 * Grids may start rectangular but become ragged after row removal, requiring re-padding or reshaping before column processing.
 * Puzzle likely aims for a "minimal bounding" or "cropped" version, removing outer/inner uniform borders but keeping internal variations that define shapes (e.g., don't remove a single 1-column if it's part of a pattern).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on iterative removal of uniform 1 and 4 blocks in rows and columns after replacing 7s, which correctly handles basic background simplification and filler removal in concept but fails due to over-aggressive min_block=1, leading to excessive trimming.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 6x10 grid with preserved internal 1s but failed to remove enough left/right columns and bottom rows, resulting in extra 4s on edges and mismatched shape (e.g., expected has 7 rows x 8 cols with cleaner borders; generated keeps irregular 1-clusters like [1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,4] instead of condensing to [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 6x8 grid that partially condenses but retains unwanted 4-columns and doesn't align rows properly (e.g., expected 7x6 with specific patterns like bottom [1,4,4,4,1,1]; generated has [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows that don't match vertical alignments, possibly due to row removal order distorting columns).
 * Training example 3: Complete failure with ERROR due to invalid grid format (likely ragged list after removals, breaking transposition; expected unknown but highlights need for rectangular output enforcement).
 * Training example 4: Generated 7x9 grid that keeps too many 4s in middle rows and doesn't extend right side properly (e.g., expected 5x12 with longer rows like [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; generated truncates to shorter widths and mismatches bottom patterns like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]).
 * Overall, the iterative loop stabilizes size but removes too much (min_block=1 collapses singles), leading to shape distortion; transposition helps but padding assumes original width, causing artifacts in processed grids.
 * Function `remove_empty_row_blocks` and similar are helpful for background but need higher min_block to avoid over-removal; `program` main loop is a good skeleton but order (rows before columns) and lack of post-processing (e.g., re-padding) cause mismatches.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., identifying connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for subtle enclosure preservation; current approach treats uniformly but ignores connectivity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x8 grid with repeating [4,1,4,1,...] patterns in top rows and denser 1s below, which does not look correct as it appears overly striped and uniform in a way that suggests over-removal of 4-blocks without condensing the overall structure—likely the result of aggressive single-row/column stripping, leaving a checkerboard-like artifact instead of a simplified shape.
 * It fails to match expected puzzle logic (mentally simulating: test input seems like a frame or enclosure with internal yellow; output should crop outer 4-borders and remove internal blue fillers, yielding a tighter 6-7x6-7 grid with preserved irregular 1-clusters, but generated keeps unnecessary 4s in columns 2,4,6 and doesn't align bottom density properly).
 * Test output mismatches by not reducing dimensions enough (stays 8x8 vs. probable smaller expected) and introduces artificial repetition (e.g., rows 1-3 identical [4,1,4,1,4,4,1,4]), indicating the iteration over-trims without merging components—does not make sense for a visual cleanup, as it looks fragmented rather than cohesive.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells are represented by numbers (1 for filled, 4 for empty, 7 for special filled variants), and the goal is to iteratively remove or collapse uniform blocks of filled cells (treating 7s as 1s) in rows and columns to reveal or extract a core shape or structure, while preserving non-uniform patterns. The process stabilizes when no more changes occur, but the exact rules involve detecting and omitting entire blocks of consecutive 1s (min size 1 in the attempt) without over-removing connected components or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s must be treated as filled (1s) for block detection but may have subtle roles in connectivity or preservation (e.g., they might prevent removal in some contexts, but the attempt converts them early).
 * Blocks of consecutive all-1 rows or columns (uniform filler) are removed if they represent "empty" or redundant space, but only if they are isolated or surrounding; connected 1s in shapes should not be fully removed.
 * The process is iterative across rows and columns (requiring transposition for columns), and it must alternate until the grid dimensions stabilize to avoid infinite loops or over-trimming.
 * Grids can be ragged (uneven row lengths), so padding with 4s during transposition is necessary to handle columns properly.
 * Subtle element: Removal should preserve the relative positions of non-uniform rows/columns, but the attempt over-removes in some cases, leaving extra 1s or failing to collapse shapes fully (e.g., not accounting for diagonal or partial connections).
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs often have trimmed borders (all-4 rows/columns removed) but retain irregular shapes; uniform 1-blocks are omitted only if they don't contribute to the core pattern, and grid sizes shrink accordingly.
 * Considerations from attempts: Alternate row and column processing order matters (row-first then column-first may cause asymmetries); check for stability by tracking height/width changes; avoid removing single rows if they are part of a larger structure.
 * All examples show that generated outputs retain more 1s or larger grids than expected, suggesting the removal criteria is too aggressive or doesn't detect "blocks" correctly (e.g., min_block=1 removes too much, perhaps needs min_block>1 or shape-aware detection).
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, which might be needed to identify preservable shapes vs. removable fillers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s to treat them as filled cells for block detection."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful for unifying 7s and 1s early, as seen in all examples where 7s appear.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s for detecting uniform filler blocks."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```
(Useful for identifying removable uniform rows; could be extended to check columns via transposition.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows, padding with 4s if ragged."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = max((len(row) for row in grid), default=0)
    t = [[4 for _ in range(h)] for _ in range(w)]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(min(w, len(grid[r]))):
            t[c][r] = grid[r][c]
    return t
```
(Essential for handling columns symmetrically; padding prevents index errors in ragged grids.)

The main `program` function's iterative loop (while dimensions change) is conceptually helpful for stabilization but broken in implementation (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails on 3/4 training examples by over-retaining 1s and failing to shrink the grid to match expected trimmed shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated has 7 rows x 12 cols with extra 1-blocks in bottom-left, while expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s in positions like row 4 col 8-10).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps a large all-1 block in rows 5-6 cols 9-12 and scattered 1s, but expected removes them entirely and trims right side (e.g., expected row 4: [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] vs generated [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,4,4,1]); unknown why, possibly because row removal doesn't propagate column collapses fully.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 6 rows x 9 cols with extra all-4 row and untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has extra 1s at ends), while expected is 7x6 with bottom row [1,4,4,4,1,1] and no extra width; attempt fails to remove partial column blocks or transpose back correctly.
 * Train 3 correct: The iterative removal stabilized to the exact expected shape, suggesting it works for simple cases without ragged edges or complex interconnections (no details provided, but implies uniform blocks were purely removable).
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated 7x9 with irregular 1s (e.g., row 6 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1] has extra 1 at end), while expected is 5x12 with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 0 has 12 cols with trailing 1s); attempt under-removes columns, leaving width too narrow and missing extensions.
 * The `remove_all_one_row_blocks` function is helpful but broken: It skips all consecutive all-1 rows correctly but doesn't handle partial blocks or re-check after column removal, leading to asymmetric results.
 * `remove_all_one_column_blocks` is helpful via transposition but not fully: Transposing back after processing can misalign if original was ragged, causing padding artifacts (e.g., extra 4s turning into preserved rows).
 * Overall attempt over-relies on min_block=1, which removes too aggressively in shapes but not enough in borders; no connected component analysis, so it can't distinguish filler from structure.
 * Function `program` loop is essential for iteration but incorrect: It breaks on dimension equality too early or doesn't alternate row/col enough times, leaving residual 1s.
 * No unhelpful functions to avoid yet, but the current block detection ignores 4s in mixed rows, which is fine; future attempts should add blob extraction to preserve shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows 8 rows x 10 cols with top 1 row of all 4s (likely a border not trimmed), alternating 1/4 patterns in rows 1-3 (preserved but perhaps should be collapsed if uniform columns), and a bottom block of 1s in rows 4-7 with partial 4s in row 7, but expected likely trims the top all-4 row, collapses the alternating columns (e.g., every other column is all-1s or near, which should remove to shrink width), and shapes the bottom into a more compact form without the trailing 1s in row 7 col 9-10.
 * Differences: Generated retains full 10-col width with alternating stripes (cols 1,3,5,7,9 are mostly 1s, cols 0,2,4,6,8 are 4s/1s), but puzzle rules probably require removing uniform 1-columns (e.g., col 1 might be all 1s after row removal, shrinking to 8 cols or less); bottom 1-block is over-preserved as four full 1-rows, while expected might remove some if they are filler or adjust for the partial row 7.
 * It makes partial sense (borders partially trimmed, shape vaguely visible), but fails to fully collapse the striped pattern and bottom block, suggesting the iterative loop stops prematurely or doesn't detect column uniforms after row changes; this mirrors Train 1/2/4 issues with incomplete trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle similar to simplifying a Nonogram or logic grid by removing redundant uniform blocks of filled cells (1s, including 7s treated as 1s) and empty cells (4s), focusing on large consecutive rows or columns to collapse the grid to its essential pattern without altering non-uniform or small blocks. The goal is to iteratively trim these blocks until the grid stabilizes, preserving the core visual structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 1s early, as they represent filled cells equivalent to 1s for block detection but may indicate special cases like hints or overlaps.
 * Distinguish between filled blocks (1s): remove even single all-1 rows/columns (min_block=1), as they often represent thin borders or fillers; empty blocks (4s): only remove if 3+ consecutive (min_block=3), to avoid over-trimming sparse empty areas.
 * Process iteratively in a loop (rows then columns, alternating) until dimensions stabilize, as removals can create new uniform blocks; transpose for column handling.
 * Preserve non-uniform rows/columns entirely, and small blocks (< min_block) to maintain pattern details like partial fills or edges.
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), so handle empty or uneven grids gracefully; expected outputs often show collapsed borders, revealing asymmetric or irregular core shapes.
 * Subtle: Uniform blocks must be strictly all-1 or all-4; mixed cells (e.g., 1s with 4s) block removal. In examples, top/bottom/left/right borders are often trimmed differently based on uniformity.
 * Potential over-removal: Aggressive min=1 for 1s can collapse too much if patterns have thin filled lines; under-removal happens if iteration misses propagated changes.
 * Shape mismatches in outputs indicate failures in transposition or block counting, e.g., expected grids are often shorter/wider than generated.
 * No rotation or cell-value changes beyond 7->1; focus on deletion of entire rows/columns.

(Note: Column versions via transpose are helpful but derived; no custom types needed beyond List[List[int]]. No object extraction functions were present or relevant here, as the puzzle is about grid simplification, not entity detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles 7->1 replacement and iterative row/column processing with different min_blocks, succeeding on Training 3 (exact match, likely due to balanced uniform borders).
 * Failed on Training 1: Generated kept extra 1-filled and 4-mixed rows/columns (e.g., retained bottom all-1 rows and irregular 4/1 mixes), resulting in taller/wider grid than expected; did not trim enough thin 1-blocks or propagated 4-blocks, leaving artifacts like [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1] rows instead of full collapse to borders.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated mismatched shape entirely (9 cols vs. expected 6), with extra 4-rows and misaligned 1/4 patterns (e.g., kept full all-4 row at bottom, altered [1,4,1,1,1,1] to include extras); transposition likely caused width errors, and min=3 for 4s didn't remove enough vertical empties.
 * Failed on Training 4: Generated shorter and differently shaped (e.g., 7 rows vs. expected 5, with misplaced 4-blocks like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), failing to preserve small 1-clusters or trim asymmetric 4-borders correctly; iteration stopped prematurely without stabilizing to expected collapsed form.
 * Overall, the uniform block detection works for simple cases but breaks on asymmetric or mixed patterns due to over-preservation of small blocks and incomplete propagation in columns.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the min_block=1 for 1s is too aggressive in some cases (collapses valid thin lines), while min=3 for 4s is insufficient for vertical empties in examples 2/4; no broken functions, but lack of diagonal or partial-block handling (not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it appears to have trimmed a top all-4 row (assuming input had one) and some right-side 1-clusters, revealing a striped pattern of alternating 4/1 columns in the top and a solid 1-block bottom, which could be a core "flag" or shape.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: the bottom section has repeated [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows with minor variations, suggesting incomplete removal of small vertical 4-columns (e.g., the single 4s in col 2/4/6 should perhaps form removable blocks if >=3 vertically, but weren't); expected likely more collapsed, e.g., merging the bottom 1-block fully and trimming isolated 4s, resulting in a tighter 6-8 row grid without the repetitive [1,4,1,4,1,...] stripes if they are uniform vertically.
 * Differences: Generated retains what looks like thin 4-columns (e.g., col 2 is mostly 4s but interrupted), which should be removed if all-4 vertically >=3; this mismatches potential expected by keeping "filler" stripes instead of collapsing to a solid pattern—unknown if input had 7s affecting this, but output feels under-trimmed compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving a 2D list of integers (primarily 1s, 4s, and possibly 7s), where the goal is to process the grid by replacing 7s with 4s and then iteratively removing or collapsing short uniform blocks of rows and columns consisting entirely of 1s or 4s, based on minimum length thresholds, until the grid stabilizes, resulting in a "collapsed" or simplified version that matches expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace all 7s with 4s at the start, as 7s appear to be a temporary or alias marker for 4s in the puzzle logic.
 * Identify and remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 1s, but only if the block length is below a minimum threshold (e.g., <2 in the attempt, but this may be incorrect based on failures).
 * Similarly, remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 4s if below a different minimum threshold (e.g., <3 in the attempt, potentially wrong).
 * Apply the same logic to columns by transposing the grid, processing, and transposing back, to handle vertical blocks.
 * Iterate the row and column removal process in a loop until no further changes occur (e.g., grid dimensions stabilize).
 * Subtlety: Removals should effectively "collapse" the grid by bringing remaining parts together, but the attempt's logic keeps short blocks instead of removing them— this inversion (keeping short vs. removing long/short) may be a key error, as expected outputs show more aggressive removal of patterns.
 * Subtlety: Thresholds may vary or be different (e.g., remove 1-blocks if >=2 or < some value; the attempt's min_block=2 for 1s and 3 for 4s leads to incomplete collapses, leaving extra 1s/4s).
 * Order matters: The attempt processes rows first, then columns via transpose, but alternating or repeating more finely might be needed; also, changes propagate (e.g., removing a row can create new uniform columns).
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), and empty grids or single cells need handling (attempt assumes non-empty).
 * Potential miss: Not all uniform blocks are rows/columns—perhaps diagonal or irregular shapes, but evidence suggests only full row/column uniforms.
 * After replacement, only 1s and 4s remain, so logic focuses on those; other numbers (if any) are preserved.
 * Loop termination via dimension check is good, but attempt's while loop may over- or under-process due to wrong removal criteria.
 * Expected outputs are smaller/simpler, suggesting removals eliminate more than the attempt does (e.g., short blocks are kept, but should be removed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_four(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[4 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful and correct for initial processing, as 7s consistently become 4s in examples.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)

def is_all_four(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(cell == 4 for cell in row)
```
(These are basic and useful for detecting uniform rows; could extend to columns directly.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]
```
(This is essential and correct for handling columns symmetrically.)

```python
def remove_all_one_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Note: This keeps short blocks; may need inversion to remove them
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result

def remove_all_four_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_four(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_four(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Same note: Keeps short; likely should remove short/long differently
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```
(These are helpful for block detection but flawed in action: they append short blocks to result (keeping them) while skipping long ones (effectively removing long), which is inverted from likely intent—expected outputs remove more, suggesting remove if < min_block. Adapt for columns via transpose.)

(The overall program structure with iteration until no change is a good skeleton, but thresholds and keep/remove logic need fixing; no object extraction needed, as it's grid-level processing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it failed all 4 training examples due to incomplete removals, leaving extra rows/columns of 1s and 4s that should have been collapsed.
 * Train 1: Generated a 7x13 grid with scattered 1s in lower rows (e.g., row 6 has [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1]), but expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s (e.g., row 6 is all 4s except positions matching a pattern); difference: attempt kept short 1-blocks and didn't propagate column removals fully, leaving dangling 1s on the right.
 * Train 2: Generated 7x9 with extra full 4-rows and misaligned 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1]), but expected 7x6 with tighter pattern (e.g., row 6 [1,4,1,4,1,1]); difference: over-kept 4-blocks and didn't remove short 1-columns, resulting in wider grid and wrong positions.
 * Train 3: Generated 9x3 with extra all-1 and all-4 rows (e.g., rows 4-5 all 4s kept, row 5 [1,1,1] kept), but expected 6x3 with only specific [4,1,4] and all-4 rows; difference: kept short uniform blocks instead of removing them, adding unnecessary rows and failing to collapse vertically.
 * Train 4: Generated 7x9 with fragmented 1s and 4s (e.g., row 3 [4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1], row 6 [1,1,4,1,1,1,1,4,1]), but expected 5x12 with extended patterns (e.g., row 1 ends in more 1s); difference: didn't extend or remove properly, leading to shorter/wrong-width grid and mismatched shapes (unknown why it truncated right side).
 * General issue: The keep-short/remove-long logic is backwards—likely should remove short blocks (< min) to match expectations; thresholds (2 for 1s, 3 for 4s) may be wrong (e.g., try 1 for 1s or 2 for 4s).
 * Transpose-based column handling works in concept but fails propagation in loop due to order (rows before columns each iteration).
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; pure grid processing.
 * Iteration loop detects changes via size, which is helpful but insufficient without correct removal.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x10 grid with patterned 1s and 4s (e.g., rows 2-4 have alternating 4,1 patterns; bottom has clustered 1s), but it does not look correct based on training patterns—expected likely a more collapsed version (e.g., 6-7 rows, removing short 1/4 blocks to tighten the checkerboard-like top and 1-clusters bottom).
 * It keeps what appear to be short uniform segments (e.g., potential short all-4 columns on left not removed), leading to a taller/wider grid than expected; top rows 1-4 suggest incomplete column collapses (alternating should propagate to remove isolated 1s vertically).
 * Bottom rows 5-9 have irregular 1-blocks that weren't fully removed, unlike training where similar clusters collapse more (e.g., Train 1 removes dangling 1s); this mismatches by preserving too much, suggesting same inversion error as training (keeps short blocks).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense as a pre-collapse state but not final—likely incorrect, as it doesn't simplify to a minimal stable grid; to handle test, invert removal logic and tune thresholds (e.g., remove 1-blocks <3, 4-blocks <2) for better propagation in alternating patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells represented by numbers (likely 1 and 7 as filled variants, 4 as empty), where the goal is to process the grid by removing large uniform blocks of filled rows/columns and trimming extraneous parts to reveal a simplified or "core" shape that matches expected outputs. The rules emphasize iterative simplification while preserving small filled blocks and handling special cases like 7s differently from 1s before final trimming.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Filled cells are 1 or 7, but 7s must be replaced with 4s (empty) only after block removal, as they initially count as filled for block detection but become empty for trimming.
 * Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive all-filled rows (or columns via transpose), but preserve smaller blocks (1-2 rows) and any non-filled rows; this must be done iteratively until no changes occur, alternating between rows and columns.
 * After block removal, replace all remaining 7s with 4s to treat them as empty, then find the leftmost column that is entirely 1s (now ignoring 7s) and trim all columns from that point to the right, keeping only the left portion.
 * Grids may not be square; transposing handles column processing, but ensure dimensions are tracked to detect convergence.
 * Subtle: All-1 columns for trimming are checked post-7 replacement, so original 7s in a column don't block it from being all-1 if they become 4s; however, if a column has mixed 1s and 7s, it won't be all-1 after replacement.
 * Easy to miss: The process is compositional—block removal first (iterative with transpose), then 7-to-4 replacement, then trim; skipping iteration or wrong order leads to over-removal or incomplete trimming.
 * Outputs must match exactly in shape and values; even small mismatches (e.g., extra columns or wrong cell values) fail.
 * No removal of small filled blocks or non-uniform rows; preserve patterns like isolated 1s or short filled segments.
 * Consider rectangular grids; trimming can change width but not height unless block removal affects rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    """Check if a row consists entirely of filled cells (1 or 7)."""
    return all(cell == 1 or cell == 7 for cell in row)

def remove_large_all_filled_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:

            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < min_block:
                result.extend(grid[start:i])
        else:

    w = len(grid[0])
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]
```
These functions are helpful for block removal and transposition; they correctly identify and preserve small filled blocks while enabling column processing.

```python
def replace_sevens_to_four(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 4s."""
    return [[4 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]

def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)

def find_first_all_one_column(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Find the index of the leftmost all-1 column, or len if none."""
    h = len(grid)

        return 0
    w = len(grid[0])
    for c in range(w):
        if all(grid[r][c] == 1 for r in range(h)):

    return w

def trim_right_from_first_all_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Trim columns from the first all-1 column to the end (after replacing 7s to 4s)."""
    grid = replace_sevens_to_four(grid)
    first = find_first_all_one_column(grid)
    return [row[:first] for row in grid]
```
These are useful for post-processing: 7-to-4 replacement and all-1 column detection/trimming; they handle the final simplification step accurately when applied in order.

```python
def process_filled_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Remove large all-filled row blocks iteratively, including via transposition for columns (min_block=3)."""
    current = grid

        current = remove_large_all_filled_row_blocks(current, 3)
        t = transpose(current)
        t = remove_large_all_filled_row_blocks(t, 3)
        current = transpose(t)
        new_h = len(current)
        new_w = len(current[0]) if current else 0
        if new_h == old_h and new_w == old_w:
            break
    return current
```
This iterative block removal function is helpful but must be applied before trimming; it converges correctly but can over-remove if not preserving small blocks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented iterative block removal (rows and columns via transpose), 7-to-4 replacement, and right-trimming from the first all-1 column, which worked correctly for Training example 3 (exact match, preserving the core shape without over-trimming).
 * For Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x8 grid with extra 1s in rows 2-6 (e.g., positions 3-7 in row 2 are 1s instead of 4s/1s mix), and mismatched patterns like row 3 having all 1s from col 2-7 vs. expected sparse 1s; this suggests block removal didn't preserve small filled segments properly, or trimming cut too early/left too much.
 * For Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid retaining extra columns (e.g., last column all 1s/4s not trimmed), and row 1 has extra 1 and 4 at end vs. expected 7x6 with trimmed width; block removal likely failed to eliminate a large filled row block (row 2 all 4s? but miscounted as filled), leading to wider output.
 * For Training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid with incomplete trimming (e.g., extra columns 9-? with 1s/4s), and row 3 has 4s in cols 5-6 instead of 1s, row 5 mismatches in col 7 (1 vs. 4); suggests transpose iteration didn't remove a vertical filled block, or 7 replacement happened too early, altering all-1 detection.
 * Overall, the attempt correctly composed the steps but failed on iteration convergence (didn't remove all large blocks in transposed views) and trimming (found wrong first all-1 column due to lingering 7s or unremoved blocks); no object extraction functions were used, but they aren't relevant here—this is grid-wide processing, not object isolation.
 * Function `process_filled_row_blocks` is helpful but broken in non-convergence for complex grids (e.g., alternating row/column blocks); `trim_right_from_first_all_one` is mostly correct but assumes post-replacement, which works if blocks are fully removed first.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the full `program` composition is flawed due to order/timing issues in applying steps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x10 grid that appears over-wide and untrimmed (e.g., columns 8-10 have patterns like 4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 that look like extraneous filled extensions, and no clear all-1 column was trimmed from).
 * It does not look correct: The top rows (1-4) show a checkerboard-like 4/1 pattern extending fully to col 10, but expected likely trims after a left-aligned all-1 column (possibly col 2 or 4, based on vertical 1s in cols 2,4,6,8), resulting in a narrower grid (e.g., 8x4 or 8x6) with preserved bottom filled block; current output retains right-side noise, suggesting trimming failed to detect the first all-1 column post-7 replacement (no 7s visible, but maybe block removal missed a vertical filled block).
 * Bottom rows (5-8) have a solid 1-block from col 3 onward, which might be a preserved small block, but the overall shape doesn't simplify to a "core" puzzle element—likely missing iterative column removal of large 1/7 blocks on the right.
 * To handle the test, ensure transpose removes any large vertical filled blocks (e.g., cols 2/4/6/8 might form partial blocks <3, but right side could have >=3), then trim precisely from the leftmost post-replacement all-1 column.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 03:48:20] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving manipulation of a matrix where cells are either "filled" (1 or 7) or "empty/background" (4), likely to simplify, normalize, or extract a core pattern such as a shape or object by removing redundant or extraneous elements like large uniform blocks, trimming edges, and cleaning up isolated artifacts. The goal is to transform input grids into expected output grids that preserve key structural features while eliminating noise, with iterative processing across rows and columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Filled cells (1 or 7) represent structure or foreground, while 4s are background; 7s seem to be a variant of filled that needs normalization to 4 (possibly indicating a different type of fill like shading or error, but treated as removable).
 * Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive entirely filled rows (all 1s or 7s) to eliminate large uniform areas, but retain smaller blocks (1-2 rows); this is iterative until no changes, but does not apply symmetrically to columns in the current program (transpose function exists but unused).
 * After row processing, trim the grid horizontally to the left of the first fully filled column (all rows in that column are 1 or 7), effectively cropping leading empty or partial columns.
 * Replace all 7s with 4s globally to standardize filled cells to 1s only, suggesting 7s are temporary or overlaid fills.
 * Conditionally remove isolated single 1s (not on edges, surrounded by 4s on both sides in the row) only if grid width >5, to clean up noise but avoid over-removal in narrow grids; this targets horizontal isolation but ignores vertical or diagonal contexts.
 * Subtlety: Processing order matters—row block removal first, then column trim, then 7-to-4 replacement, then isolated 1 removal; skipping iterations or wrong order can leave artifacts.
 * No rotation or transpose is applied in the final program, despite the function existing, which might miss vertical symmetries; grids can have varying widths/heights, and assumptions like uniform row lengths must hold.
 * Easy to miss: Filled rows/columns are strictly all 1 or 7—no mixes; isolation check is row-wise only and skips edges; trimming is left-only, not symmetric or right-side.
 * Broader considerations: Puzzle may involve object extraction (e.g., connected components of 1s), but current approach is rule-based simplification rather than full segmentation; test grids may have asymmetric patterns requiring bidirectional trimming or vertical processing.
 * Outputs must match exactly in structure and values, including preserved 1 positions that form the "core" shape.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly implements row-wise large block removal iteratively, 7-to-4 replacement, left-trimming, and conditional isolated 1 removal, which worked for training example 3 (full match, preserving a simple pattern without over-removal).
 * For training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a solid block of 1s in rows 2-5 (e.g., [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4]), but expected has split patterns like [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4] in row 2 and [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] in row 4; difference is failure to break up or preserve internal 4s/holes within what should be separate objects, possibly due to no column-wise processing or missing vertical isolation rules—over-merged the shape.
 * For training 2 (INCORRECT): Generated keeps extra 1s and 4s in mismatched positions, e.g., row 2 as [4,4,4,4,4,4] (all background) and row 2 expected [4,4,4,4,1,4]; row 6 as [1,4,1,1,1,1] vs expected [1,4,1,4,1,1]—isolated 1 removal didn't trigger or was too aggressive in wrong spots, and trimming left partial columns intact; unknown why row 2 fully backgrounded (possibly erroneous row block removal).
 * For training 3 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected, suggesting the ruleset handles simple, narrow patterns well without needing column removal or advanced isolation.
 * For training 4 (INCORRECT): Generated has shorter widths and mismatched 1 placements, e.g., row 0 [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1] vs expected longer [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; row 5 [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]—trimming cut too much (left-trim removed right extensions), and no handling for vertical fills or right-side preservation; isolated 1s not addressed properly in complex shapes.
 * The iterative row block removal is helpful but incomplete without column equivalent (transpose + remove could fix vertical slabs, as seen in training 1's merged blocks).
 * Isolated 1 removal is conditionally applied but broken for patterns with edge-adjacent or multi-row singles (doesn't catch vertical isolation, leading to artifacts in training 2 and 4).
 * Trimming function is one-sided and post-row-processing, which works for left-empty cases but fails asymmetric test inputs like training 4's extended rights.
 * No object extraction (e.g., connected components) attempted; rules are heuristic but miss subtle connectivity (e.g., 1s connected diagonally or via 7s before replacement).
 * Unhelpful/broken: The transpose is defined but not used in the main program loop, making vertical processing impossible—don't rely on it without integration; the width>5 condition for isolation feels arbitrary and skips narrow cases like training 2.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially processed but likely incorrect: it shows a top all-4 row, three rows with trailing single 1s (e.g., [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), and then four rows starting with 1 followed by 4s and a block of 1s (e.g., [1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1]), suggesting left-trim kept some structure but possibly over-trimmed width (original likely wider) and failed to remove vertical filled aspects or isolate the trailing 1s properly.
 * It does not look fully correct because the trailing single 1s in rows 1-3 seem like isolated artifacts that should be removed (similar to training 2's mismatches), and the bottom block looks merged without internal 4s/holes, unlike training 1's expected splits—mentally applying rules, if the input has vertical filled columns or right extensions, the one-sided trim and row-only isolation would leave noise; no large row blocks removed (no all-1/7 rows apparent), but without expected, it mismatches puzzle intent of clean shape extraction.
 * To handle test, program needs bidirectional trimming (left and right to bounding box of 1s) and vertical isolation removal, as current output retains potential edge noise and doesn't normalize to a compact shape.

[2025-10-01 03:48:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

```

    """Remove blocks of 3+ consecutive all-1 rows (partially helpful for vertical fillers, but broken for non-all-1 patterns, column trimming, or 2D shapes—causes mismatches in examples 1,2,4)."""

    n = len(processed)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(processed[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(processed[i]):
                i += 1
            block_size = i - start
            if block_size < 3:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(processed[j])
        else:
            result.append(processed[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colored pixels in a visual diagram (1 for filled blue elements to remove as filler, 4 for empty yellow background to condense, 7 for dark red elements to convert to background), with the goal of simplifying the grid by removing uniform blocks of filler or background in rows and columns while preserving the core yellow pixel structures and enclosures, often resulting in a resized grid that matches a cleaner, expected outline.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 4s first to eliminate dark red intrusions without affecting yellow positions.
 * Uniform blocks of 1s (all-1 rows/columns) represent filler blue masses that should be removed if they form large consecutive blocks, but smaller or non-uniform ones must be preserved to avoid distorting enclosures.
 * Uniform blocks of 4s (all-4 rows/columns) represent empty background that can be condensed or removed, but only larger blocks to avoid over-trimming essential spacing around yellow components.
 * Process iteratively until the grid stabilizes (no size change), alternating row and column removals to handle both directions, but order matters—removing empty rows first simplifies background before tackling filler.
 * Transposition is key for column processing, but ragged grids (uneven row lengths) need padding with 4s to avoid errors.
 * Subtlety: min_block=1 is too aggressive, removing even single uniform rows/columns, which collapses structures prematurely; higher thresholds (e.g., 2+) might preserve small details like thin borders or isolated pixels.
 * Preserve approximate yellow pixel count by selective removal—over-removal leads to mismatched shapes; enclosures (blue around yellow) should adjust but not vanish.
 * Error handling: Ensure output is a valid rectangular list-of-lists; transposition on non-rectangular grids can cause format errors if not padded properly.
 * Grids may start rectangular but become ragged after row removal, requiring re-padding or reshaping before column processing.
 * Puzzle likely aims for a "minimal bounding" or "cropped" version, removing outer/inner uniform borders but keeping internal variations that define shapes (e.g., don't remove a single 1-column if it's part of a pattern).

        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on iterative removal of uniform 1 and 4 blocks in rows and columns after replacing 7s, which correctly handles basic background simplification and filler removal in concept but fails due to over-aggressive min_block=1, leading to excessive trimming.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 6x10 grid with preserved internal 1s but failed to remove enough left/right columns and bottom rows, resulting in extra 4s on edges and mismatched shape (e.g., expected has 7 rows x 8 cols with cleaner borders; generated keeps irregular 1-clusters like [1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,4] instead of condensing to [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 6x8 grid that partially condenses but retains unwanted 4-columns and doesn't align rows properly (e.g., expected 7x6 with specific patterns like bottom [1,4,4,4,1,1]; generated has [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows that don't match vertical alignments, possibly due to row removal order distorting columns).
 * Training example 3: Complete failure with ERROR due to invalid grid format (likely ragged list after removals, breaking transposition; expected unknown but highlights need for rectangular output enforcement).
 * Training example 4: Generated 7x9 grid that keeps too many 4s in middle rows and doesn't extend right side properly (e.g., expected 5x12 with longer rows like [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; generated truncates to shorter widths and mismatches bottom patterns like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]).
 * Overall, the iterative loop stabilizes size but removes too much (min_block=1 collapses singles), leading to shape distortion; transposition helps but padding assumes original width, causing artifacts in processed grids.
 * Function `remove_empty_row_blocks` and similar are helpful for background but need higher min_block to avoid over-removal; `program` main loop is a good skeleton but order (rows before columns) and lack of post-processing (e.g., re-padding) cause mismatches.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., identifying connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for subtle enclosure preservation; current approach treats uniformly but ignores connectivity.

 * The generated test output is an 8x8 grid with repeating [4,1,4,1,...] patterns in top rows and denser 1s below, which does not look correct as it appears overly striped and uniform in a way that suggests over-removal of 4-blocks without condensing the overall structure—likely the result of aggressive single-row/column stripping, leaving a checkerboard-like artifact instead of a simplified shape.
 * It fails to match expected puzzle logic (mentally simulating: test input seems like a frame or enclosure with internal yellow; output should crop outer 4-borders and remove internal blue fillers, yielding a tighter 6-7x6-7 grid with preserved irregular 1-clusters, but generated keeps unnecessary 4s in columns 2,4,6 and doesn't align bottom density properly).
 * Test output mismatches by not reducing dimensions enough (stays 8x8 vs. probable smaller expected) and introduces artificial repetition (e.g., rows 1-3 identical [4,1,4,1,4,4,1,4]), indicating the iteration over-trims without merging components—does not make sense for a visual cleanup, as it looks fragmented rather than cohesive.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells are represented by numbers (1 for filled, 4 for empty, 7 for special filled variants), and the goal is to iteratively remove or collapse uniform blocks of filled cells (treating 7s as 1s) in rows and columns to reveal or extract a core shape or structure, while preserving non-uniform patterns. The process stabilizes when no more changes occur, but the exact rules involve detecting and omitting entire blocks of consecutive 1s (min size 1 in the attempt) without over-removing connected components or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s must be treated as filled (1s) for block detection but may have subtle roles in connectivity or preservation (e.g., they might prevent removal in some contexts, but the attempt converts them early).
 * Blocks of consecutive all-1 rows or columns (uniform filler) are removed if they represent "empty" or redundant space, but only if they are isolated or surrounding; connected 1s in shapes should not be fully removed.
 * The process is iterative across rows and columns (requiring transposition for columns), and it must alternate until the grid dimensions stabilize to avoid infinite loops or over-trimming.
 * Grids can be ragged (uneven row lengths), so padding with 4s during transposition is necessary to handle columns properly.
 * Subtle element: Removal should preserve the relative positions of non-uniform rows/columns, but the attempt over-removes in some cases, leaving extra 1s or failing to collapse shapes fully (e.g., not accounting for diagonal or partial connections).
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs often have trimmed borders (all-4 rows/columns removed) but retain irregular shapes; uniform 1-blocks are omitted only if they don't contribute to the core pattern, and grid sizes shrink accordingly.
 * Considerations from attempts: Alternate row and column processing order matters (row-first then column-first may cause asymmetries); check for stability by tracking height/width changes; avoid removing single rows if they are part of a larger structure.
 * All examples show that generated outputs retain more 1s or larger grids than expected, suggesting the removal criteria is too aggressive or doesn't detect "blocks" correctly (e.g., min_block=1 removes too much, perhaps needs min_block>1 or shape-aware detection).
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, which might be needed to identify preservable shapes vs. removable fillers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s to treat them as filled cells for block detection."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful for unifying 7s and 1s early, as seen in all examples where 7s appear.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s for detecting uniform filler blocks."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```
(Useful for identifying removable uniform rows; could be extended to check columns via transposition.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows, padding with 4s if ragged."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = max((len(row) for row in grid), default=0)
    t = [[4 for _ in range(h)] for _ in range(w)]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(min(w, len(grid[r]))):
            t[c][r] = grid[r][c]
    return t
```
(Essential for handling columns symmetrically; padding prevents index errors in ragged grids.)

The main `program` function's iterative loop (while dimensions change) is conceptually helpful for stabilization but broken in implementation (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails on 3/4 training examples by over-retaining 1s and failing to shrink the grid to match expected trimmed shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated has 7 rows x 12 cols with extra 1-blocks in bottom-left, while expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s in positions like row 4 col 8-10).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps a large all-1 block in rows 5-6 cols 9-12 and scattered 1s, but expected removes them entirely and trims right side (e.g., expected row 4: [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] vs generated [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,4,4,1]); unknown why, possibly because row removal doesn't propagate column collapses fully.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 6 rows x 9 cols with extra all-4 row and untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has extra 1s at ends), while expected is 7x6 with bottom row [1,4,4,4,1,1] and no extra width; attempt fails to remove partial column blocks or transpose back correctly.
 * Train 3 correct: The iterative removal stabilized to the exact expected shape, suggesting it works for simple cases without ragged edges or complex interconnections (no details provided, but implies uniform blocks were purely removable).
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated 7x9 with irregular 1s (e.g., row 6 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1] has extra 1 at end), while expected is 5x12 with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 0 has 12 cols with trailing 1s); attempt under-removes columns, leaving width too narrow and missing extensions.
 * The `remove_all_one_row_blocks` function is helpful but broken: It skips all consecutive all-1 rows correctly but doesn't handle partial blocks or re-check after column removal, leading to asymmetric results.
 * `remove_all_one_column_blocks` is helpful via transposition but not fully: Transposing back after processing can misalign if original was ragged, causing padding artifacts (e.g., extra 4s turning into preserved rows).
 * Overall attempt over-relies on min_block=1, which removes too aggressively in shapes but not enough in borders; no connected component analysis, so it can't distinguish filler from structure.
 * Function `program` loop is essential for iteration but incorrect: It breaks on dimension equality too early or doesn't alternate row/col enough times, leaving residual 1s.
 * No unhelpful functions to avoid yet, but the current block detection ignores 4s in mixed rows, which is fine; future attempts should add blob extraction to preserve shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows 8 rows x 10 cols with top 1 row of all 4s (likely a border not trimmed), alternating 1/4 patterns in rows 1-3 (preserved but perhaps should be collapsed if uniform columns), and a bottom block of 1s in rows 4-7 with partial 4s in row 7, but expected likely trims the top all-4 row, collapses the alternating columns (e.g., every other column is all-1s or near, which should remove to shrink width), and shapes the bottom into a more compact form without the trailing 1s in row 7 col 9-10.
 * Differences: Generated retains full 10-col width with alternating stripes (cols 1,3,5,7,9 are mostly 1s, cols 0,2,4,6,8 are 4s/1s), but puzzle rules probably require removing uniform 1-columns (e.g., col 1 might be all 1s after row removal, shrinking to 8 cols or less); bottom 1-block is over-preserved as four full 1-rows, while expected might remove some if they are filler or adjust for the partial row 7.
 * It makes partial sense (borders partially trimmed, shape vaguely visible), but fails to fully collapse the striped pattern and bottom block, suggesting the iterative loop stops prematurely or doesn't detect column uniforms after row changes; this mirrors Train 1/2/4 issues with incomplete trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

    return transpose(t_processed)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle similar to simplifying a Nonogram or logic grid by removing redundant uniform blocks of filled cells (1s, including 7s treated as 1s) and empty cells (4s), focusing on large consecutive rows or columns to collapse the grid to its essential pattern without altering non-uniform or small blocks. The goal is to iteratively trim these blocks until the grid stabilizes, preserving the core visual structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 1s early, as they represent filled cells equivalent to 1s for block detection but may indicate special cases like hints or overlaps.
 * Distinguish between filled blocks (1s): remove even single all-1 rows/columns (min_block=1), as they often represent thin borders or fillers; empty blocks (4s): only remove if 3+ consecutive (min_block=3), to avoid over-trimming sparse empty areas.
 * Process iteratively in a loop (rows then columns, alternating) until dimensions stabilize, as removals can create new uniform blocks; transpose for column handling.
 * Preserve non-uniform rows/columns entirely, and small blocks (< min_block) to maintain pattern details like partial fills or edges.
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), so handle empty or uneven grids gracefully; expected outputs often show collapsed borders, revealing asymmetric or irregular core shapes.
 * Subtle: Uniform blocks must be strictly all-1 or all-4; mixed cells (e.g., 1s with 4s) block removal. In examples, top/bottom/left/right borders are often trimmed differently based on uniformity.
 * Potential over-removal: Aggressive min=1 for 1s can collapse too much if patterns have thin filled lines; under-removal happens if iteration misses propagated changes.
 * Shape mismatches in outputs indicate failures in transposition or block counting, e.g., expected grids are often shorter/wider than generated.
 * No rotation or cell-value changes beyond 7->1; focus on deletion of entire rows/columns.

(Note: Column versions via transpose are helpful but derived; no custom types needed beyond List[List[int]]. No object extraction functions were present or relevant here, as the puzzle is about grid simplification, not entity detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles 7->1 replacement and iterative row/column processing with different min_blocks, succeeding on Training 3 (exact match, likely due to balanced uniform borders).
 * Failed on Training 1: Generated kept extra 1-filled and 4-mixed rows/columns (e.g., retained bottom all-1 rows and irregular 4/1 mixes), resulting in taller/wider grid than expected; did not trim enough thin 1-blocks or propagated 4-blocks, leaving artifacts like [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1] rows instead of full collapse to borders.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated mismatched shape entirely (9 cols vs. expected 6), with extra 4-rows and misaligned 1/4 patterns (e.g., kept full all-4 row at bottom, altered [1,4,1,1,1,1] to include extras); transposition likely caused width errors, and min=3 for 4s didn't remove enough vertical empties.
 * Failed on Training 4: Generated shorter and differently shaped (e.g., 7 rows vs. expected 5, with misplaced 4-blocks like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), failing to preserve small 1-clusters or trim asymmetric 4-borders correctly; iteration stopped prematurely without stabilizing to expected collapsed form.
 * Overall, the uniform block detection works for simple cases but breaks on asymmetric or mixed patterns due to over-preservation of small blocks and incomplete propagation in columns.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the min_block=1 for 1s is too aggressive in some cases (collapses valid thin lines), while min=3 for 4s is insufficient for vertical empties in examples 2/4; no broken functions, but lack of diagonal or partial-block handling (not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it appears to have trimmed a top all-4 row (assuming input had one) and some right-side 1-clusters, revealing a striped pattern of alternating 4/1 columns in the top and a solid 1-block bottom, which could be a core "flag" or shape.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: the bottom section has repeated [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows with minor variations, suggesting incomplete removal of small vertical 4-columns (e.g., the single 4s in col 2/4/6 should perhaps form removable blocks if >=3 vertically, but weren't); expected likely more collapsed, e.g., merging the bottom 1-block fully and trimming isolated 4s, resulting in a tighter 6-8 row grid without the repetitive [1,4,1,4,1,...] stripes if they are uniform vertically.
 * Differences: Generated retains what looks like thin 4-columns (e.g., col 2 is mostly 4s but interrupted), which should be removed if all-4 vertically >=3; this mismatches potential expected by keeping "filler" stripes instead of collapsing to a solid pattern—unknown if input had 7s affecting this, but output feels under-trimmed compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving a 2D list of integers (primarily 1s, 4s, and possibly 7s), where the goal is to process the grid by replacing 7s with 4s and then iteratively removing or collapsing short uniform blocks of rows and columns consisting entirely of 1s or 4s, based on minimum length thresholds, until the grid stabilizes, resulting in a "collapsed" or simplified version that matches expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace all 7s with 4s at the start, as 7s appear to be a temporary or alias marker for 4s in the puzzle logic.
 * Identify and remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 1s, but only if the block length is below a minimum threshold (e.g., <2 in the attempt, but this may be incorrect based on failures).
 * Similarly, remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 4s if below a different minimum threshold (e.g., <3 in the attempt, potentially wrong).
 * Apply the same logic to columns by transposing the grid, processing, and transposing back, to handle vertical blocks.
 * Iterate the row and column removal process in a loop until no further changes occur (e.g., grid dimensions stabilize).
 * Subtlety: Removals should effectively "collapse" the grid by bringing remaining parts together, but the attempt's logic keeps short blocks instead of removing them— this inversion (keeping short vs. removing long/short) may be a key error, as expected outputs show more aggressive removal of patterns.
 * Subtlety: Thresholds may vary or be different (e.g., remove 1-blocks if >=2 or < some value; the attempt's min_block=2 for 1s and 3 for 4s leads to incomplete collapses, leaving extra 1s/4s).
 * Order matters: The attempt processes rows first, then columns via transpose, but alternating or repeating more finely might be needed; also, changes propagate (e.g., removing a row can create new uniform columns).
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), and empty grids or single cells need handling (attempt assumes non-empty).
 * Potential miss: Not all uniform blocks are rows/columns—perhaps diagonal or irregular shapes, but evidence suggests only full row/column uniforms.
 * After replacement, only 1s and 4s remain, so logic focuses on those; other numbers (if any) are preserved.
 * Loop termination via dimension check is good, but attempt's while loop may over- or under-process due to wrong removal criteria.
 * Expected outputs are smaller/simpler, suggesting removals eliminate more than the attempt does (e.g., short blocks are kept, but should be removed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_four(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[4 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful and correct for initial processing, as 7s consistently become 4s in examples.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)

def is_all_four(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(cell == 4 for cell in row)
```
(These are basic and useful for detecting uniform rows; could extend to columns directly.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]
```
(This is essential and correct for handling columns symmetrically.)

```python
def remove_all_one_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Note: This keeps short blocks; may need inversion to remove them
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result

def remove_all_four_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_four(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_four(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Same note: Keeps short; likely should remove short/long differently
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```
(These are helpful for block detection but flawed in action: they append short blocks to result (keeping them) while skipping long ones (effectively removing long), which is inverted from likely intent—expected outputs remove more, suggesting remove if < min_block. Adapt for columns via transpose.)

(The overall program structure with iteration until no change is a good skeleton, but thresholds and keep/remove logic need fixing; no object extraction needed, as it's grid-level processing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it failed all 4 training examples due to incomplete removals, leaving extra rows/columns of 1s and 4s that should have been collapsed.
 * Train 1: Generated a 7x13 grid with scattered 1s in lower rows (e.g., row 6 has [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1]), but expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s (e.g., row 6 is all 4s except positions matching a pattern); difference: attempt kept short 1-blocks and didn't propagate column removals fully, leaving dangling 1s on the right.
 * Train 2: Generated 7x9 with extra full 4-rows and misaligned 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1]), but expected 7x6 with tighter pattern (e.g., row 6 [1,4,1,4,1,1]); difference: over-kept 4-blocks and didn't remove short 1-columns, resulting in wider grid and wrong positions.
 * Train 3: Generated 9x3 with extra all-1 and all-4 rows (e.g., rows 4-5 all 4s kept, row 5 [1,1,1] kept), but expected 6x3 with only specific [4,1,4] and all-4 rows; difference: kept short uniform blocks instead of removing them, adding unnecessary rows and failing to collapse vertically.
 * Train 4: Generated 7x9 with fragmented 1s and 4s (e.g., row 3 [4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1], row 6 [1,1,4,1,1,1,1,4,1]), but expected 5x12 with extended patterns (e.g., row 1 ends in more 1s); difference: didn't extend or remove properly, leading to shorter/wrong-width grid and mismatched shapes (unknown why it truncated right side).
 * General issue: The keep-short/remove-long logic is backwards—likely should remove short blocks (< min) to match expectations; thresholds (2 for 1s, 3 for 4s) may be wrong (e.g., try 1 for 1s or 2 for 4s).
 * Transpose-based column handling works in concept but fails propagation in loop due to order (rows before columns each iteration).
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; pure grid processing.
 * Iteration loop detects changes via size, which is helpful but insufficient without correct removal.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x10 grid with patterned 1s and 4s (e.g., rows 2-4 have alternating 4,1 patterns; bottom has clustered 1s), but it does not look correct based on training patterns—expected likely a more collapsed version (e.g., 6-7 rows, removing short 1/4 blocks to tighten the checkerboard-like top and 1-clusters bottom).
 * It keeps what appear to be short uniform segments (e.g., potential short all-4 columns on left not removed), leading to a taller/wider grid than expected; top rows 1-4 suggest incomplete column collapses (alternating should propagate to remove isolated 1s vertically).
 * Bottom rows 5-9 have irregular 1-blocks that weren't fully removed, unlike training where similar clusters collapse more (e.g., Train 1 removes dangling 1s); this mismatches by preserving too much, suggesting same inversion error as training (keeps short blocks).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense as a pre-collapse state but not final—likely incorrect, as it doesn't simplify to a minimal stable grid; to handle test, invert removal logic and tune thresholds (e.g., remove 1-blocks <3, 4-blocks <2) for better propagation in alternating patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells represented by numbers (likely 1 and 7 as filled variants, 4 as empty), where the goal is to process the grid by removing large uniform blocks of filled rows/columns and trimming extraneous parts to reveal a simplified or "core" shape that matches expected outputs. The rules emphasize iterative simplification while preserving small filled blocks and handling special cases like 7s differently from 1s before final trimming.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Filled cells are 1 or 7, but 7s must be replaced with 4s (empty) only after block removal, as they initially count as filled for block detection but become empty for trimming.
 * Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive all-filled rows (or columns via transpose), but preserve smaller blocks (1-2 rows) and any non-filled rows; this must be done iteratively until no changes occur, alternating between rows and columns.
 * After block removal, replace all remaining 7s with 4s to treat them as empty, then find the leftmost column that is entirely 1s (now ignoring 7s) and trim all columns from that point to the right, keeping only the left portion.
 * Grids may not be square; transposing handles column processing, but ensure dimensions are tracked to detect convergence.
 * Subtle: All-1 columns for trimming are checked post-7 replacement, so original 7s in a column don't block it from being all-1 if they become 4s; however, if a column has mixed 1s and 7s, it won't be all-1 after replacement.
 * Easy to miss: The process is compositional—block removal first (iterative with transpose), then 7-to-4 replacement, then trim; skipping iteration or wrong order leads to over-removal or incomplete trimming.
 * Outputs must match exactly in shape and values; even small mismatches (e.g., extra columns or wrong cell values) fail.
 * No removal of small filled blocks or non-uniform rows; preserve patterns like isolated 1s or short filled segments.
 * Consider rectangular grids; trimming can change width but not height unless block removal affects rows.

These functions are helpful for block removal and transposition; they correctly identify and preserve small filled blocks while enabling column processing.

    first = find_first_all_one_column(grid)
    return [row[:first] for row in grid]
```
These are useful for post-processing: 7-to-4 replacement and all-1 column detection/trimming; they handle the final simplification step accurately when applied in order.

```python

        t = transpose(current)
        t = remove_large_all_filled_row_blocks(t, 3)

        if new_h == old_h and new_w == old_w:
            break
    return current
```
This iterative block removal function is helpful but must be applied before trimming; it converges correctly but can over-remove if not preserving small blocks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented iterative block removal (rows and columns via transpose), 7-to-4 replacement, and right-trimming from the first all-1 column, which worked correctly for Training example 3 (exact match, preserving the core shape without over-trimming).
 * For Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x8 grid with extra 1s in rows 2-6 (e.g., positions 3-7 in row 2 are 1s instead of 4s/1s mix), and mismatched patterns like row 3 having all 1s from col 2-7 vs. expected sparse 1s; this suggests block removal didn't preserve small filled segments properly, or trimming cut too early/left too much.
 * For Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid retaining extra columns (e.g., last column all 1s/4s not trimmed), and row 1 has extra 1 and 4 at end vs. expected 7x6 with trimmed width; block removal likely failed to eliminate a large filled row block (row 2 all 4s? but miscounted as filled), leading to wider output.
 * For Training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid with incomplete trimming (e.g., extra columns 9-? with 1s/4s), and row 3 has 4s in cols 5-6 instead of 1s, row 5 mismatches in col 7 (1 vs. 4); suggests transpose iteration didn't remove a vertical filled block, or 7 replacement happened too early, altering all-1 detection.
 * Overall, the attempt correctly composed the steps but failed on iteration convergence (didn't remove all large blocks in transposed views) and trimming (found wrong first all-1 column due to lingering 7s or unremoved blocks); no object extraction functions were used, but they aren't relevant here—this is grid-wide processing, not object isolation.
 * Function `process_filled_row_blocks` is helpful but broken in non-convergence for complex grids (e.g., alternating row/column blocks); `trim_right_from_first_all_one` is mostly correct but assumes post-replacement, which works if blocks are fully removed first.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the full `program` composition is flawed due to order/timing issues in applying steps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x10 grid that appears over-wide and untrimmed (e.g., columns 8-10 have patterns like 4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 that look like extraneous filled extensions, and no clear all-1 column was trimmed from).
 * It does not look correct: The top rows (1-4) show a checkerboard-like 4/1 pattern extending fully to col 10, but expected likely trims after a left-aligned all-1 column (possibly col 2 or 4, based on vertical 1s in cols 2,4,6,8), resulting in a narrower grid (e.g., 8x4 or 8x6) with preserved bottom filled block; current output retains right-side noise, suggesting trimming failed to detect the first all-1 column post-7 replacement (no 7s visible, but maybe block removal missed a vertical filled block).
 * Bottom rows (5-8) have a solid 1-block from col 3 onward, which might be a preserved small block, but the overall shape doesn't simplify to a "core" puzzle element—likely missing iterative column removal of large 1/7 blocks on the right.
 * To handle the test, ensure transpose removes any large vertical filled blocks (e.g., cols 2/4/6/8 might form partial blocks <3, but right side could have >=3), then trim precisely from the leftmost post-replacement all-1 column.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving manipulation of a matrix where cells are either "filled" (1 or 7) or "empty/background" (4), likely to simplify, normalize, or extract a core pattern such as a shape or object by removing redundant or extraneous elements like large uniform blocks, trimming edges, and cleaning up isolated artifacts. The goal is to transform input grids into expected output grids that preserve key structural features while eliminating noise, with iterative processing across rows and columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Filled cells (1 or 7) represent structure or foreground, while 4s are background; 7s seem to be a variant of filled that needs normalization to 4 (possibly indicating a different type of fill like shading or error, but treated as removable).
 * Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive entirely filled rows (all 1s or 7s) to eliminate large uniform areas, but retain smaller blocks (1-2 rows); this is iterative until no changes, but does not apply symmetrically to columns in the current program (transpose function exists but unused).
 * After row processing, trim the grid horizontally to the left of the first fully filled column (all rows in that column are 1 or 7), effectively cropping leading empty or partial columns.
 * Replace all 7s with 4s globally to standardize filled cells to 1s only, suggesting 7s are temporary or overlaid fills.
 * Conditionally remove isolated single 1s (not on edges, surrounded by 4s on both sides in the row) only if grid width >5, to clean up noise but avoid over-removal in narrow grids; this targets horizontal isolation but ignores vertical or diagonal contexts.
 * Subtlety: Processing order matters—row block removal first, then column trim, then 7-to-4 replacement, then isolated 1 removal; skipping iterations or wrong order can leave artifacts.
 * No rotation or transpose is applied in the final program, despite the function existing, which might miss vertical symmetries; grids can have varying widths/heights, and assumptions like uniform row lengths must hold.
 * Easy to miss: Filled rows/columns are strictly all 1 or 7—no mixes; isolation check is row-wise only and skips edges; trimming is left-only, not symmetric or right-side.
 * Broader considerations: Puzzle may involve object extraction (e.g., connected components of 1s), but current approach is rule-based simplification rather than full segmentation; test grids may have asymmetric patterns requiring bidirectional trimming or vertical processing.
 * Outputs must match exactly in structure and values, including preserved 1 positions that form the "core" shape.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly implements row-wise large block removal iteratively, 7-to-4 replacement, left-trimming, and conditional isolated 1 removal, which worked for training example 3 (full match, preserving a simple pattern without over-removal).
 * For training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a solid block of 1s in rows 2-5 (e.g., [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4]), but expected has split patterns like [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4] in row 2 and [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] in row 4; difference is failure to break up or preserve internal 4s/holes within what should be separate objects, possibly due to no column-wise processing or missing vertical isolation rules—over-merged the shape.
 * For training 2 (INCORRECT): Generated keeps extra 1s and 4s in mismatched positions, e.g., row 2 as [4,4,4,4,4,4] (all background) and row 2 expected [4,4,4,4,1,4]; row 6 as [1,4,1,1,1,1] vs expected [1,4,1,4,1,1]—isolated 1 removal didn't trigger or was too aggressive in wrong spots, and trimming left partial columns intact; unknown why row 2 fully backgrounded (possibly erroneous row block removal).
 * For training 3 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected, suggesting the ruleset handles simple, narrow patterns well without needing column removal or advanced isolation.
 * For training 4 (INCORRECT): Generated has shorter widths and mismatched 1 placements, e.g., row 0 [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1] vs expected longer [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; row 5 [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]—trimming cut too much (left-trim removed right extensions), and no handling for vertical fills or right-side preservation; isolated 1s not addressed properly in complex shapes.
 * The iterative row block removal is helpful but incomplete without column equivalent (transpose + remove could fix vertical slabs, as seen in training 1's merged blocks).
 * Isolated 1 removal is conditionally applied but broken for patterns with edge-adjacent or multi-row singles (doesn't catch vertical isolation, leading to artifacts in training 2 and 4).
 * Trimming function is one-sided and post-row-processing, which works for left-empty cases but fails asymmetric test inputs like training 4's extended rights.
 * No object extraction (e.g., connected components) attempted; rules are heuristic but miss subtle connectivity (e.g., 1s connected diagonally or via 7s before replacement).
 * Unhelpful/broken: The transpose is defined but not used in the main program loop, making vertical processing impossible—don't rely on it without integration; the width>5 condition for isolation feels arbitrary and skips narrow cases like training 2.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially processed but likely incorrect: it shows a top all-4 row, three rows with trailing single 1s (e.g., [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), and then four rows starting with 1 followed by 4s and a block of 1s (e.g., [1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1]), suggesting left-trim kept some structure but possibly over-trimmed width (original likely wider) and failed to remove vertical filled aspects or isolate the trailing 1s properly.
 * It does not look fully correct because the trailing single 1s in rows 1-3 seem like isolated artifacts that should be removed (similar to training 2's mismatches), and the bottom block looks merged without internal 4s/holes, unlike training 1's expected splits—mentally applying rules, if the input has vertical filled columns or right extensions, the one-sided trim and row-only isolation would leave noise; no large row blocks removed (no all-1/7 rows apparent), but without expected, it mismatches puzzle intent of clean shape extraction.
 * To handle test, program needs bidirectional trimming (left and right to bounding box of 1s) and vertical isolation removal, as current output retains potential edge noise and doesn't normalize to a compact shape.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 04:05:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a grid of cells (using numbers like 1 for filled, 7 for special markers, 4 for cleaned/empty) by iteratively removing large blocks of fully filled rows and columns, handling special 7 markers by converting them and nearby filled cells to cleaned states, and trimming the grid to focus on the core puzzle area up to the first fully filled column. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected patterns, likely representing a solved or reduced form of a logic puzzle like a Nonogram or filled-region diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive all-filled rows (all 1s or 7s) or columns, but preserve smaller blocks (<3) and non-filled rows/columns; this must be done iteratively in both directions (rows then transpose for columns) until the grid stabilizes.
 * Handling 7s: 7s act as special markers; convert each 7 to 4, and clean (set to 4) up to 2 following consecutive 1s in the same row to the right, but do not affect cells beyond that or in other directions; remaining 7s after initial cleaning should also be set to 4 (or sometimes treated as 1 for detection purposes like trimming).
 * Trimming: After processing, identify the leftmost column that is entirely 1s (treating 7s as 1s for this check) and trim the grid to include only columns up to and including that one; ensure row lengths align post-trimming to avoid mismatches.
 * Filled detection: "All-filled" means every cell in a row/column is either 1 or 7; subtle issue: 7s should sometimes be treated as equivalent to 1s for filling checks but distinctly for cleaning.
 * Iteration stability: The removal of filled blocks must alternate between rows and columns via transposition until no more changes occur in grid dimensions, to handle interdependent row/column removals.
 * Grid consistency: Ensure the final grid has uniform row lengths; if trimming uses a temp grid for detection, align the main grid accordingly to prevent length mismatches.
 * Subtle misses: Over-cleaning (e.g., setting too many 1s to 4s beyond rules) or under-cleaning (e.g., not handling 7s in columns) leads to pattern errors; trimming too early or late can cut off expected filled areas; 7s in non-row contexts (e.g., after transposition) may need re-processing.
 * Other considerations: Grids may have varying sizes; empty grids should return empty; preserve non-filled cells exactly; potential for 7s to create "tails" of cleaned cells that affect block detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a grid with incorrect patterns in rows 3-6, where 1s were not cleaned to 4s in positions like columns 4-7 (e.g., row 3 has [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4] but expected [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]), likely due to over-trimming or insufficient cleaning of 7-related tails; bottom row matched but middle patterns mismatched in filled areas.
 * Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a much wider grid (9 columns vs. expected 6) with extra 4s and 1s appended (e.g., row 0 [4,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4] vs. expected [4,1,1,1,1,1]), and patterns like row 2 [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1] missing trims; suggests trimming failed to cut right side properly, and block removal didn't reduce dimensions enough.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): The full process_filled_blocks, clean_right_of_sevens, 7-replacement, and trim_to_first_all_one combination worked perfectly here, indicating the iterative block removal and row-based 7 cleaning handle some symmetric or simple cases well.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated grid is narrower (9 columns vs. expected 12) and missing right-side extensions (e.g., row 0 [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1] vs. expected with 12 elements including extra 1s and 4s); patterns in rows 3-4 have mismatched 1s/4s (e.g., row 3 [1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1] vs. expected with more 1s and a trailing 4,1); likely trimming cut too much, and cleaning didn't preserve extended filled areas.
 * Overall: process_filled_blocks is helpful for dimension reduction but may remove too aggressively if 7s are misinterpreted as non-filled post-cleaning; clean_right_of_sevens works for row-based 7 tails but is limited to 2 following 1s (may need adjustment for longer tails); trim_to_first_all_one is essential but buggy when using temp grids for 7-as-1 detection without proper alignment, leading to length mismatches; no extraction of "objects" like blobs was attempted, but it might be useful for identifying disconnected filled regions if the puzzle involves that (not evident yet).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 8 rows and 10 columns, with a patterned structure of alternating 1s and 4s in upper rows (e.g., rows 1-3: [4,1,4,1,4,1,4,...] repeating), transitioning to solid 1s in lower rows (e.g., rows 4-7 mostly 1s with some 4s on left); this looks somewhat plausible for a puzzle reduction but does not appear fully correct, as it retains a full 10-column width without trimming (no evident all-1 column to cut at), and the top row is all 4s while lower parts have unbroken 1-runs that might need block removal if they were 7-mixed originally.
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Likely over-retains width (expected might trim after column 6-8 where 1-runs start), and patterns like the diagonal-ish 1s in upper rows may not have been cleaned properly around implicit 7s; bottom rows have consistent [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,...] but expected could have more 4s if 7-tails were cleaned; it mismatches subtlety by not reducing vertical filled blocks (e.g., columns 4-6 are mostly 1s in lower half, potentially a removable block if >=3).
 * The output makes partial sense (alternating patterns suggest preserved puzzle clues) but not fully correct, as it ignores potential column-wise filled blocks and trimming, leading to an unreduced grid; account for test cases with vertical 7s or longer 1-tails requiring extended cleaning.

[2025-10-01 04:05:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colored pixels in a visual diagram (1 for filled blue elements to remove as filler, 4 for empty yellow background to condense, 7 for dark red elements to convert to background), with the goal of simplifying the grid by removing uniform blocks of filler or background in rows and columns while preserving the core yellow pixel structures and enclosures, often resulting in a resized grid that matches a cleaner, expected outline.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 4s first to eliminate dark red intrusions without affecting yellow positions.
 * Uniform blocks of 1s (all-1 rows/columns) represent filler blue masses that should be removed if they form large consecutive blocks, but smaller or non-uniform ones must be preserved to avoid distorting enclosures.
 * Uniform blocks of 4s (all-4 rows/columns) represent empty background that can be condensed or removed, but only larger blocks to avoid over-trimming essential spacing around yellow components.
 * Process iteratively until the grid stabilizes (no size change), alternating row and column removals to handle both directions, but order matters—removing empty rows first simplifies background before tackling filler.
 * Transposition is key for column processing, but ragged grids (uneven row lengths) need padding with 4s to avoid errors.
 * Subtlety: min_block=1 is too aggressive, removing even single uniform rows/columns, which collapses structures prematurely; higher thresholds (e.g., 2+) might preserve small details like thin borders or isolated pixels.
 * Preserve approximate yellow pixel count by selective removal—over-removal leads to mismatched shapes; enclosures (blue around yellow) should adjust but not vanish.
 * Error handling: Ensure output is a valid rectangular list-of-lists; transposition on non-rectangular grids can cause format errors if not padded properly.
 * Grids may start rectangular but become ragged after row removal, requiring re-padding or reshaping before column processing.
 * Puzzle likely aims for a "minimal bounding" or "cropped" version, removing outer/inner uniform borders but keeping internal variations that define shapes (e.g., don't remove a single 1-column if it's part of a pattern).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on iterative removal of uniform 1 and 4 blocks in rows and columns after replacing 7s, which correctly handles basic background simplification and filler removal in concept but fails due to over-aggressive min_block=1, leading to excessive trimming.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 6x10 grid with preserved internal 1s but failed to remove enough left/right columns and bottom rows, resulting in extra 4s on edges and mismatched shape (e.g., expected has 7 rows x 8 cols with cleaner borders; generated keeps irregular 1-clusters like [1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,4] instead of condensing to [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 6x8 grid that partially condenses but retains unwanted 4-columns and doesn't align rows properly (e.g., expected 7x6 with specific patterns like bottom [1,4,4,4,1,1]; generated has [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows that don't match vertical alignments, possibly due to row removal order distorting columns).
 * Training example 3: Complete failure with ERROR due to invalid grid format (likely ragged list after removals, breaking transposition; expected unknown but highlights need for rectangular output enforcement).
 * Training example 4: Generated 7x9 grid that keeps too many 4s in middle rows and doesn't extend right side properly (e.g., expected 5x12 with longer rows like [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; generated truncates to shorter widths and mismatches bottom patterns like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]).
 * Overall, the iterative loop stabilizes size but removes too much (min_block=1 collapses singles), leading to shape distortion; transposition helps but padding assumes original width, causing artifacts in processed grids.
 * Function `remove_empty_row_blocks` and similar are helpful for background but need higher min_block to avoid over-removal; `program` main loop is a good skeleton but order (rows before columns) and lack of post-processing (e.g., re-padding) cause mismatches.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., identifying connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for subtle enclosure preservation; current approach treats uniformly but ignores connectivity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x8 grid with repeating [4,1,4,1,...] patterns in top rows and denser 1s below, which does not look correct as it appears overly striped and uniform in a way that suggests over-removal of 4-blocks without condensing the overall structure—likely the result of aggressive single-row/column stripping, leaving a checkerboard-like artifact instead of a simplified shape.
 * It fails to match expected puzzle logic (mentally simulating: test input seems like a frame or enclosure with internal yellow; output should crop outer 4-borders and remove internal blue fillers, yielding a tighter 6-7x6-7 grid with preserved irregular 1-clusters, but generated keeps unnecessary 4s in columns 2,4,6 and doesn't align bottom density properly).
 * Test output mismatches by not reducing dimensions enough (stays 8x8 vs. probable smaller expected) and introduces artificial repetition (e.g., rows 1-3 identical [4,1,4,1,4,4,1,4]), indicating the iteration over-trims without merging components—does not make sense for a visual cleanup, as it looks fragmented rather than cohesive.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells are represented by numbers (1 for filled, 4 for empty, 7 for special filled variants), and the goal is to iteratively remove or collapse uniform blocks of filled cells (treating 7s as 1s) in rows and columns to reveal or extract a core shape or structure, while preserving non-uniform patterns. The process stabilizes when no more changes occur, but the exact rules involve detecting and omitting entire blocks of consecutive 1s (min size 1 in the attempt) without over-removing connected components or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s must be treated as filled (1s) for block detection but may have subtle roles in connectivity or preservation (e.g., they might prevent removal in some contexts, but the attempt converts them early).
 * Blocks of consecutive all-1 rows or columns (uniform filler) are removed if they represent "empty" or redundant space, but only if they are isolated or surrounding; connected 1s in shapes should not be fully removed.
 * The process is iterative across rows and columns (requiring transposition for columns), and it must alternate until the grid dimensions stabilize to avoid infinite loops or over-trimming.
 * Grids can be ragged (uneven row lengths), so padding with 4s during transposition is necessary to handle columns properly.
 * Subtle element: Removal should preserve the relative positions of non-uniform rows/columns, but the attempt over-removes in some cases, leaving extra 1s or failing to collapse shapes fully (e.g., not accounting for diagonal or partial connections).
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs often have trimmed borders (all-4 rows/columns removed) but retain irregular shapes; uniform 1-blocks are omitted only if they don't contribute to the core pattern, and grid sizes shrink accordingly.
 * Considerations from attempts: Alternate row and column processing order matters (row-first then column-first may cause asymmetries); check for stability by tracking height/width changes; avoid removing single rows if they are part of a larger structure.
 * All examples show that generated outputs retain more 1s or larger grids than expected, suggesting the removal criteria is too aggressive or doesn't detect "blocks" correctly (e.g., min_block=1 removes too much, perhaps needs min_block>1 or shape-aware detection).
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, which might be needed to identify preservable shapes vs. removable fillers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s to treat them as filled cells for block detection."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful for unifying 7s and 1s early, as seen in all examples where 7s appear.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s for detecting uniform filler blocks."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```
(Useful for identifying removable uniform rows; could be extended to check columns via transposition.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows, padding with 4s if ragged."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = max((len(row) for row in grid), default=0)
    t = [[4 for _ in range(h)] for _ in range(w)]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(min(w, len(grid[r]))):
            t[c][r] = grid[r][c]
    return t
```
(Essential for handling columns symmetrically; padding prevents index errors in ragged grids.)

The main `program` function's iterative loop (while dimensions change) is conceptually helpful for stabilization but broken in implementation (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails on 3/4 training examples by over-retaining 1s and failing to shrink the grid to match expected trimmed shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated has 7 rows x 12 cols with extra 1-blocks in bottom-left, while expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s in positions like row 4 col 8-10).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps a large all-1 block in rows 5-6 cols 9-12 and scattered 1s, but expected removes them entirely and trims right side (e.g., expected row 4: [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] vs generated [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,4,4,1]); unknown why, possibly because row removal doesn't propagate column collapses fully.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 6 rows x 9 cols with extra all-4 row and untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has extra 1s at ends), while expected is 7x6 with bottom row [1,4,4,4,1,1] and no extra width; attempt fails to remove partial column blocks or transpose back correctly.
 * Train 3 correct: The iterative removal stabilized to the exact expected shape, suggesting it works for simple cases without ragged edges or complex interconnections (no details provided, but implies uniform blocks were purely removable).
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated 7x9 with irregular 1s (e.g., row 6 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1] has extra 1 at end), while expected is 5x12 with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 0 has 12 cols with trailing 1s); attempt under-removes columns, leaving width too narrow and missing extensions.
 * The `remove_all_one_row_blocks` function is helpful but broken: It skips all consecutive all-1 rows correctly but doesn't handle partial blocks or re-check after column removal, leading to asymmetric results.
 * `remove_all_one_column_blocks` is helpful via transposition but not fully: Transposing back after processing can misalign if original was ragged, causing padding artifacts (e.g., extra 4s turning into preserved rows).
 * Overall attempt over-relies on min_block=1, which removes too aggressively in shapes but not enough in borders; no connected component analysis, so it can't distinguish filler from structure.
 * Function `program` loop is essential for iteration but incorrect: It breaks on dimension equality too early or doesn't alternate row/col enough times, leaving residual 1s.
 * No unhelpful functions to avoid yet, but the current block detection ignores 4s in mixed rows, which is fine; future attempts should add blob extraction to preserve shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows 8 rows x 10 cols with top 1 row of all 4s (likely a border not trimmed), alternating 1/4 patterns in rows 1-3 (preserved but perhaps should be collapsed if uniform columns), and a bottom block of 1s in rows 4-7 with partial 4s in row 7, but expected likely trims the top all-4 row, collapses the alternating columns (e.g., every other column is all-1s or near, which should remove to shrink width), and shapes the bottom into a more compact form without the trailing 1s in row 7 col 9-10.
 * Differences: Generated retains full 10-col width with alternating stripes (cols 1,3,5,7,9 are mostly 1s, cols 0,2,4,6,8 are 4s/1s), but puzzle rules probably require removing uniform 1-columns (e.g., col 1 might be all 1s after row removal, shrinking to 8 cols or less); bottom 1-block is over-preserved as four full 1-rows, while expected might remove some if they are filler or adjust for the partial row 7.
 * It makes partial sense (borders partially trimmed, shape vaguely visible), but fails to fully collapse the striped pattern and bottom block, suggesting the iterative loop stops prematurely or doesn't detect column uniforms after row changes; this mirrors Train 1/2/4 issues with incomplete trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle similar to simplifying a Nonogram or logic grid by removing redundant uniform blocks of filled cells (1s, including 7s treated as 1s) and empty cells (4s), focusing on large consecutive rows or columns to collapse the grid to its essential pattern without altering non-uniform or small blocks. The goal is to iteratively trim these blocks until the grid stabilizes, preserving the core visual structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 1s early, as they represent filled cells equivalent to 1s for block detection but may indicate special cases like hints or overlaps.
 * Distinguish between filled blocks (1s): remove even single all-1 rows/columns (min_block=1), as they often represent thin borders or fillers; empty blocks (4s): only remove if 3+ consecutive (min_block=3), to avoid over-trimming sparse empty areas.
 * Process iteratively in a loop (rows then columns, alternating) until dimensions stabilize, as removals can create new uniform blocks; transpose for column handling.
 * Preserve non-uniform rows/columns entirely, and small blocks (< min_block) to maintain pattern details like partial fills or edges.
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), so handle empty or uneven grids gracefully; expected outputs often show collapsed borders, revealing asymmetric or irregular core shapes.
 * Subtle: Uniform blocks must be strictly all-1 or all-4; mixed cells (e.g., 1s with 4s) block removal. In examples, top/bottom/left/right borders are often trimmed differently based on uniformity.
 * Potential over-removal: Aggressive min=1 for 1s can collapse too much if patterns have thin filled lines; under-removal happens if iteration misses propagated changes.
 * Shape mismatches in outputs indicate failures in transposition or block counting, e.g., expected grids are often shorter/wider than generated.
 * No rotation or cell-value changes beyond 7->1; focus on deletion of entire rows/columns.

(Note: Column versions via transpose are helpful but derived; no custom types needed beyond List[List[int]]. No object extraction functions were present or relevant here, as the puzzle is about grid simplification, not entity detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles 7->1 replacement and iterative row/column processing with different min_blocks, succeeding on Training 3 (exact match, likely due to balanced uniform borders).
 * Failed on Training 1: Generated kept extra 1-filled and 4-mixed rows/columns (e.g., retained bottom all-1 rows and irregular 4/1 mixes), resulting in taller/wider grid than expected; did not trim enough thin 1-blocks or propagated 4-blocks, leaving artifacts like [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1] rows instead of full collapse to borders.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated mismatched shape entirely (9 cols vs. expected 6), with extra 4-rows and misaligned 1/4 patterns (e.g., kept full all-4 row at bottom, altered [1,4,1,1,1,1] to include extras); transposition likely caused width errors, and min=3 for 4s didn't remove enough vertical empties.
 * Failed on Training 4: Generated shorter and differently shaped (e.g., 7 rows vs. expected 5, with misplaced 4-blocks like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), failing to preserve small 1-clusters or trim asymmetric 4-borders correctly; iteration stopped prematurely without stabilizing to expected collapsed form.
 * Overall, the uniform block detection works for simple cases but breaks on asymmetric or mixed patterns due to over-preservation of small blocks and incomplete propagation in columns.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the min_block=1 for 1s is too aggressive in some cases (collapses valid thin lines), while min=3 for 4s is insufficient for vertical empties in examples 2/4; no broken functions, but lack of diagonal or partial-block handling (not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it appears to have trimmed a top all-4 row (assuming input had one) and some right-side 1-clusters, revealing a striped pattern of alternating 4/1 columns in the top and a solid 1-block bottom, which could be a core "flag" or shape.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: the bottom section has repeated [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows with minor variations, suggesting incomplete removal of small vertical 4-columns (e.g., the single 4s in col 2/4/6 should perhaps form removable blocks if >=3 vertically, but weren't); expected likely more collapsed, e.g., merging the bottom 1-block fully and trimming isolated 4s, resulting in a tighter 6-8 row grid without the repetitive [1,4,1,4,1,...] stripes if they are uniform vertically.
 * Differences: Generated retains what looks like thin 4-columns (e.g., col 2 is mostly 4s but interrupted), which should be removed if all-4 vertically >=3; this mismatches potential expected by keeping "filler" stripes instead of collapsing to a solid pattern—unknown if input had 7s affecting this, but output feels under-trimmed compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving a 2D list of integers (primarily 1s, 4s, and possibly 7s), where the goal is to process the grid by replacing 7s with 4s and then iteratively removing or collapsing short uniform blocks of rows and columns consisting entirely of 1s or 4s, based on minimum length thresholds, until the grid stabilizes, resulting in a "collapsed" or simplified version that matches expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace all 7s with 4s at the start, as 7s appear to be a temporary or alias marker for 4s in the puzzle logic.
 * Identify and remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 1s, but only if the block length is below a minimum threshold (e.g., <2 in the attempt, but this may be incorrect based on failures).
 * Similarly, remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 4s if below a different minimum threshold (e.g., <3 in the attempt, potentially wrong).
 * Apply the same logic to columns by transposing the grid, processing, and transposing back, to handle vertical blocks.
 * Iterate the row and column removal process in a loop until no further changes occur (e.g., grid dimensions stabilize).
 * Subtlety: Removals should effectively "collapse" the grid by bringing remaining parts together, but the attempt's logic keeps short blocks instead of removing them— this inversion (keeping short vs. removing long/short) may be a key error, as expected outputs show more aggressive removal of patterns.
 * Subtlety: Thresholds may vary or be different (e.g., remove 1-blocks if >=2 or < some value; the attempt's min_block=2 for 1s and 3 for 4s leads to incomplete collapses, leaving extra 1s/4s).
 * Order matters: The attempt processes rows first, then columns via transpose, but alternating or repeating more finely might be needed; also, changes propagate (e.g., removing a row can create new uniform columns).
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), and empty grids or single cells need handling (attempt assumes non-empty).
 * Potential miss: Not all uniform blocks are rows/columns—perhaps diagonal or irregular shapes, but evidence suggests only full row/column uniforms.
 * After replacement, only 1s and 4s remain, so logic focuses on those; other numbers (if any) are preserved.
 * Loop termination via dimension check is good, but attempt's while loop may over- or under-process due to wrong removal criteria.
 * Expected outputs are smaller/simpler, suggesting removals eliminate more than the attempt does (e.g., short blocks are kept, but should be removed).

def replace_sevens_to_four(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

(This is essential and correct for handling columns symmetrically.)

                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1

            start = i

                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Same note: Keeps short; likely should remove short/long differently
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```
(These are helpful for block detection but flawed in action: they append short blocks to result (keeping them) while skipping long ones (effectively removing long), which is inverted from likely intent—expected outputs remove more, suggesting remove if < min_block. Adapt for columns via transpose.)

(The overall program structure with iteration until no change is a good skeleton, but thresholds and keep/remove logic need fixing; no object extraction needed, as it's grid-level processing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it failed all 4 training examples due to incomplete removals, leaving extra rows/columns of 1s and 4s that should have been collapsed.
 * Train 1: Generated a 7x13 grid with scattered 1s in lower rows (e.g., row 6 has [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1]), but expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s (e.g., row 6 is all 4s except positions matching a pattern); difference: attempt kept short 1-blocks and didn't propagate column removals fully, leaving dangling 1s on the right.
 * Train 2: Generated 7x9 with extra full 4-rows and misaligned 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1]), but expected 7x6 with tighter pattern (e.g., row 6 [1,4,1,4,1,1]); difference: over-kept 4-blocks and didn't remove short 1-columns, resulting in wider grid and wrong positions.
 * Train 3: Generated 9x3 with extra all-1 and all-4 rows (e.g., rows 4-5 all 4s kept, row 5 [1,1,1] kept), but expected 6x3 with only specific [4,1,4] and all-4 rows; difference: kept short uniform blocks instead of removing them, adding unnecessary rows and failing to collapse vertically.
 * Train 4: Generated 7x9 with fragmented 1s and 4s (e.g., row 3 [4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1], row 6 [1,1,4,1,1,1,1,4,1]), but expected 5x12 with extended patterns (e.g., row 1 ends in more 1s); difference: didn't extend or remove properly, leading to shorter/wrong-width grid and mismatched shapes (unknown why it truncated right side).
 * General issue: The keep-short/remove-long logic is backwards—likely should remove short blocks (< min) to match expectations; thresholds (2 for 1s, 3 for 4s) may be wrong (e.g., try 1 for 1s or 2 for 4s).
 * Transpose-based column handling works in concept but fails propagation in loop due to order (rows before columns each iteration).
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; pure grid processing.
 * Iteration loop detects changes via size, which is helpful but insufficient without correct removal.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x10 grid with patterned 1s and 4s (e.g., rows 2-4 have alternating 4,1 patterns; bottom has clustered 1s), but it does not look correct based on training patterns—expected likely a more collapsed version (e.g., 6-7 rows, removing short 1/4 blocks to tighten the checkerboard-like top and 1-clusters bottom).
 * It keeps what appear to be short uniform segments (e.g., potential short all-4 columns on left not removed), leading to a taller/wider grid than expected; top rows 1-4 suggest incomplete column collapses (alternating should propagate to remove isolated 1s vertically).
 * Bottom rows 5-9 have irregular 1-blocks that weren't fully removed, unlike training where similar clusters collapse more (e.g., Train 1 removes dangling 1s); this mismatches by preserving too much, suggesting same inversion error as training (keeps short blocks).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense as a pre-collapse state but not final—likely incorrect, as it doesn't simplify to a minimal stable grid; to handle test, invert removal logic and tune thresholds (e.g., remove 1-blocks <3, 4-blocks <2) for better propagation in alternating patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells represented by numbers (likely 1 and 7 as filled variants, 4 as empty), where the goal is to process the grid by removing large uniform blocks of filled rows/columns and trimming extraneous parts to reveal a simplified or "core" shape that matches expected outputs. The rules emphasize iterative simplification while preserving small filled blocks and handling special cases like 7s differently from 1s before final trimming.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Filled cells are 1 or 7, but 7s must be replaced with 4s (empty) only after block removal, as they initially count as filled for block detection but become empty for trimming.
 * Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive all-filled rows (or columns via transpose), but preserve smaller blocks (1-2 rows) and any non-filled rows; this must be done iteratively until no changes occur, alternating between rows and columns.
 * After block removal, replace all remaining 7s with 4s to treat them as empty, then find the leftmost column that is entirely 1s (now ignoring 7s) and trim all columns from that point to the right, keeping only the left portion.
 * Grids may not be square; transposing handles column processing, but ensure dimensions are tracked to detect convergence.
 * Subtle: All-1 columns for trimming are checked post-7 replacement, so original 7s in a column don't block it from being all-1 if they become 4s; however, if a column has mixed 1s and 7s, it won't be all-1 after replacement.
 * Easy to miss: The process is compositional—block removal first (iterative with transpose), then 7-to-4 replacement, then trim; skipping iteration or wrong order leads to over-removal or incomplete trimming.
 * Outputs must match exactly in shape and values; even small mismatches (e.g., extra columns or wrong cell values) fail.
 * No removal of small filled blocks or non-uniform rows; preserve patterns like isolated 1s or short filled segments.
 * Consider rectangular grids; trimming can change width but not height unless block removal affects rows.

This iterative block removal function is helpful but must be applied before trimming; it converges correctly but can over-remove if not preserving small blocks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented iterative block removal (rows and columns via transpose), 7-to-4 replacement, and right-trimming from the first all-1 column, which worked correctly for Training example 3 (exact match, preserving the core shape without over-trimming).
 * For Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x8 grid with extra 1s in rows 2-6 (e.g., positions 3-7 in row 2 are 1s instead of 4s/1s mix), and mismatched patterns like row 3 having all 1s from col 2-7 vs. expected sparse 1s; this suggests block removal didn't preserve small filled segments properly, or trimming cut too early/left too much.
 * For Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid retaining extra columns (e.g., last column all 1s/4s not trimmed), and row 1 has extra 1 and 4 at end vs. expected 7x6 with trimmed width; block removal likely failed to eliminate a large filled row block (row 2 all 4s? but miscounted as filled), leading to wider output.
 * For Training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid with incomplete trimming (e.g., extra columns 9-? with 1s/4s), and row 3 has 4s in cols 5-6 instead of 1s, row 5 mismatches in col 7 (1 vs. 4); suggests transpose iteration didn't remove a vertical filled block, or 7 replacement happened too early, altering all-1 detection.
 * Overall, the attempt correctly composed the steps but failed on iteration convergence (didn't remove all large blocks in transposed views) and trimming (found wrong first all-1 column due to lingering 7s or unremoved blocks); no object extraction functions were used, but they aren't relevant here—this is grid-wide processing, not object isolation.
 * Function `process_filled_row_blocks` is helpful but broken in non-convergence for complex grids (e.g., alternating row/column blocks); `trim_right_from_first_all_one` is mostly correct but assumes post-replacement, which works if blocks are fully removed first.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the full `program` composition is flawed due to order/timing issues in applying steps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x10 grid that appears over-wide and untrimmed (e.g., columns 8-10 have patterns like 4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 that look like extraneous filled extensions, and no clear all-1 column was trimmed from).
 * It does not look correct: The top rows (1-4) show a checkerboard-like 4/1 pattern extending fully to col 10, but expected likely trims after a left-aligned all-1 column (possibly col 2 or 4, based on vertical 1s in cols 2,4,6,8), resulting in a narrower grid (e.g., 8x4 or 8x6) with preserved bottom filled block; current output retains right-side noise, suggesting trimming failed to detect the first all-1 column post-7 replacement (no 7s visible, but maybe block removal missed a vertical filled block).
 * Bottom rows (5-8) have a solid 1-block from col 3 onward, which might be a preserved small block, but the overall shape doesn't simplify to a "core" puzzle element—likely missing iterative column removal of large 1/7 blocks on the right.
 * To handle the test, ensure transpose removes any large vertical filled blocks (e.g., cols 2/4/6/8 might form partial blocks <3, but right side could have >=3), then trim precisely from the leftmost post-replacement all-1 column.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving manipulation of a matrix where cells are either "filled" (1 or 7) or "empty/background" (4), likely to simplify, normalize, or extract a core pattern such as a shape or object by removing redundant or extraneous elements like large uniform blocks, trimming edges, and cleaning up isolated artifacts. The goal is to transform input grids into expected output grids that preserve key structural features while eliminating noise, with iterative processing across rows and columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Filled cells (1 or 7) represent structure or foreground, while 4s are background; 7s seem to be a variant of filled that needs normalization to 4 (possibly indicating a different type of fill like shading or error, but treated as removable).
 * Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive entirely filled rows (all 1s or 7s) to eliminate large uniform areas, but retain smaller blocks (1-2 rows); this is iterative until no changes, but does not apply symmetrically to columns in the current program (transpose function exists but unused).
 * After row processing, trim the grid horizontally to the left of the first fully filled column (all rows in that column are 1 or 7), effectively cropping leading empty or partial columns.
 * Replace all 7s with 4s globally to standardize filled cells to 1s only, suggesting 7s are temporary or overlaid fills.
 * Conditionally remove isolated single 1s (not on edges, surrounded by 4s on both sides in the row) only if grid width >5, to clean up noise but avoid over-removal in narrow grids; this targets horizontal isolation but ignores vertical or diagonal contexts.
 * Subtlety: Processing order matters—row block removal first, then column trim, then 7-to-4 replacement, then isolated 1 removal; skipping iterations or wrong order can leave artifacts.
 * No rotation or transpose is applied in the final program, despite the function existing, which might miss vertical symmetries; grids can have varying widths/heights, and assumptions like uniform row lengths must hold.
 * Easy to miss: Filled rows/columns are strictly all 1 or 7—no mixes; isolation check is row-wise only and skips edges; trimming is left-only, not symmetric or right-side.
 * Broader considerations: Puzzle may involve object extraction (e.g., connected components of 1s), but current approach is rule-based simplification rather than full segmentation; test grids may have asymmetric patterns requiring bidirectional trimming or vertical processing.
 * Outputs must match exactly in structure and values, including preserved 1 positions that form the "core" shape.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly implements row-wise large block removal iteratively, 7-to-4 replacement, left-trimming, and conditional isolated 1 removal, which worked for training example 3 (full match, preserving a simple pattern without over-removal).
 * For training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a solid block of 1s in rows 2-5 (e.g., [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4]), but expected has split patterns like [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4] in row 2 and [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] in row 4; difference is failure to break up or preserve internal 4s/holes within what should be separate objects, possibly due to no column-wise processing or missing vertical isolation rules—over-merged the shape.
 * For training 2 (INCORRECT): Generated keeps extra 1s and 4s in mismatched positions, e.g., row 2 as [4,4,4,4,4,4] (all background) and row 2 expected [4,4,4,4,1,4]; row 6 as [1,4,1,1,1,1] vs expected [1,4,1,4,1,1]—isolated 1 removal didn't trigger or was too aggressive in wrong spots, and trimming left partial columns intact; unknown why row 2 fully backgrounded (possibly erroneous row block removal).
 * For training 3 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected, suggesting the ruleset handles simple, narrow patterns well without needing column removal or advanced isolation.
 * For training 4 (INCORRECT): Generated has shorter widths and mismatched 1 placements, e.g., row 0 [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1] vs expected longer [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; row 5 [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]—trimming cut too much (left-trim removed right extensions), and no handling for vertical fills or right-side preservation; isolated 1s not addressed properly in complex shapes.
 * The iterative row block removal is helpful but incomplete without column equivalent (transpose + remove could fix vertical slabs, as seen in training 1's merged blocks).
 * Isolated 1 removal is conditionally applied but broken for patterns with edge-adjacent or multi-row singles (doesn't catch vertical isolation, leading to artifacts in training 2 and 4).
 * Trimming function is one-sided and post-row-processing, which works for left-empty cases but fails asymmetric test inputs like training 4's extended rights.
 * No object extraction (e.g., connected components) attempted; rules are heuristic but miss subtle connectivity (e.g., 1s connected diagonally or via 7s before replacement).
 * Unhelpful/broken: The transpose is defined but not used in the main program loop, making vertical processing impossible—don't rely on it without integration; the width>5 condition for isolation feels arbitrary and skips narrow cases like training 2.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially processed but likely incorrect: it shows a top all-4 row, three rows with trailing single 1s (e.g., [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), and then four rows starting with 1 followed by 4s and a block of 1s (e.g., [1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1]), suggesting left-trim kept some structure but possibly over-trimmed width (original likely wider) and failed to remove vertical filled aspects or isolate the trailing 1s properly.
 * It does not look fully correct because the trailing single 1s in rows 1-3 seem like isolated artifacts that should be removed (similar to training 2's mismatches), and the bottom block looks merged without internal 4s/holes, unlike training 1's expected splits—mentally applying rules, if the input has vertical filled columns or right extensions, the one-sided trim and row-only isolation would leave noise; no large row blocks removed (no all-1/7 rows apparent), but without expected, it mismatches puzzle intent of clean shape extraction.
 * To handle test, program needs bidirectional trimming (left and right to bounding box of 1s) and vertical isolation removal, as current output retains potential edge noise and doesn't normalize to a compact shape.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a grid of cells (using numbers like 1 for filled, 7 for special markers, 4 for cleaned/empty) by iteratively removing large blocks of fully filled rows and columns, handling special 7 markers by converting them and nearby filled cells to cleaned states, and trimming the grid to focus on the core puzzle area up to the first fully filled column. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected patterns, likely representing a solved or reduced form of a logic puzzle like a Nonogram or filled-region diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive all-filled rows (all 1s or 7s) or columns, but preserve smaller blocks (<3) and non-filled rows/columns; this must be done iteratively in both directions (rows then transpose for columns) until the grid stabilizes.
 * Handling 7s: 7s act as special markers; convert each 7 to 4, and clean (set to 4) up to 2 following consecutive 1s in the same row to the right, but do not affect cells beyond that or in other directions; remaining 7s after initial cleaning should also be set to 4 (or sometimes treated as 1 for detection purposes like trimming).
 * Trimming: After processing, identify the leftmost column that is entirely 1s (treating 7s as 1s for this check) and trim the grid to include only columns up to and including that one; ensure row lengths align post-trimming to avoid mismatches.
 * Filled detection: "All-filled" means every cell in a row/column is either 1 or 7; subtle issue: 7s should sometimes be treated as equivalent to 1s for filling checks but distinctly for cleaning.
 * Iteration stability: The removal of filled blocks must alternate between rows and columns via transposition until no more changes occur in grid dimensions, to handle interdependent row/column removals.
 * Grid consistency: Ensure the final grid has uniform row lengths; if trimming uses a temp grid for detection, align the main grid accordingly to prevent length mismatches.
 * Subtle misses: Over-cleaning (e.g., setting too many 1s to 4s beyond rules) or under-cleaning (e.g., not handling 7s in columns) leads to pattern errors; trimming too early or late can cut off expected filled areas; 7s in non-row contexts (e.g., after transposition) may need re-processing.
 * Other considerations: Grids may have varying sizes; empty grids should return empty; preserve non-filled cells exactly; potential for 7s to create "tails" of cleaned cells that affect block detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a grid with incorrect patterns in rows 3-6, where 1s were not cleaned to 4s in positions like columns 4-7 (e.g., row 3 has [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4] but expected [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]), likely due to over-trimming or insufficient cleaning of 7-related tails; bottom row matched but middle patterns mismatched in filled areas.
 * Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a much wider grid (9 columns vs. expected 6) with extra 4s and 1s appended (e.g., row 0 [4,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4] vs. expected [4,1,1,1,1,1]), and patterns like row 2 [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1] missing trims; suggests trimming failed to cut right side properly, and block removal didn't reduce dimensions enough.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): The full process_filled_blocks, clean_right_of_sevens, 7-replacement, and trim_to_first_all_one combination worked perfectly here, indicating the iterative block removal and row-based 7 cleaning handle some symmetric or simple cases well.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated grid is narrower (9 columns vs. expected 12) and missing right-side extensions (e.g., row 0 [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1] vs. expected with 12 elements including extra 1s and 4s); patterns in rows 3-4 have mismatched 1s/4s (e.g., row 3 [1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1] vs. expected with more 1s and a trailing 4,1); likely trimming cut too much, and cleaning didn't preserve extended filled areas.
 * Overall: process_filled_blocks is helpful for dimension reduction but may remove too aggressively if 7s are misinterpreted as non-filled post-cleaning; clean_right_of_sevens works for row-based 7 tails but is limited to 2 following 1s (may need adjustment for longer tails); trim_to_first_all_one is essential but buggy when using temp grids for 7-as-1 detection without proper alignment, leading to length mismatches; no extraction of "objects" like blobs was attempted, but it might be useful for identifying disconnected filled regions if the puzzle involves that (not evident yet).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 8 rows and 10 columns, with a patterned structure of alternating 1s and 4s in upper rows (e.g., rows 1-3: [4,1,4,1,4,1,4,...] repeating), transitioning to solid 1s in lower rows (e.g., rows 4-7 mostly 1s with some 4s on left); this looks somewhat plausible for a puzzle reduction but does not appear fully correct, as it retains a full 10-column width without trimming (no evident all-1 column to cut at), and the top row is all 4s while lower parts have unbroken 1-runs that might need block removal if they were 7-mixed originally.
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Likely over-retains width (expected might trim after column 6-8 where 1-runs start), and patterns like the diagonal-ish 1s in upper rows may not have been cleaned properly around implicit 7s; bottom rows have consistent [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,...] but expected could have more 4s if 7-tails were cleaned; it mismatches subtlety by not reducing vertical filled blocks (e.g., columns 4-6 are mostly 1s in lower half, potentially a removable block if >=3).
 * The output makes partial sense (alternating patterns suggest preserved puzzle clues) but not fully correct, as it ignores potential column-wise filled blocks and trimming, leading to an unreduced grid; account for test cases with vertical 7s or longer 1-tails requiring extended cleaning.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 04:20:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle solver that applies iterative rules to simplify or "clean" a numerical grid by identifying and removing large blocks of filled (1 or 7) rows/columns, propagating fillings from trigger patterns (like sequences of 7s followed by 1s) horizontally and vertically, and trimming extraneous parts, ultimately transforming the grid into a standardized output with 4s representing filled/propagated areas and 1s as unfilled or partial elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core filling rule: Cells with 1 or 7 are considered "filled"; all-filled rows/columns (every cell filled) in blocks of 3+ consecutive ones must be removed iteratively in both horizontal and vertical directions until the grid stabilizes, preserving smaller blocks (<3).
 * Horizontal cleaning: Sequences starting with 7s are cleaned to 4s; the first 7 is temporarily marked (e.g., with 8) for later propagation, and up to 2 following 1s are also set to 4s; this handles "triggers" but requires careful bounding to avoid over-propagation.
 * Vertical propagation: From temp markers (8) or remaining 7s, propagate downward up to 2 steps (converting 1s to 4s) and upward up to 1 step; this must be done via transposition to treat columns as rows, and reversal for upward direction, but limits prevent infinite loops or over-filling.
 * Trimming: After processing, remove all columns from (and including) the first fully 1-filled column to the end, which acts as a boundary cleaner but can fail if no such column exists or if propagation hasn't created one correctly.
 * Subtleties: Temp marking (8) is crucial for deferred propagation but must be cleaned up; over-propagation of 1s to 4s is a common error (e.g., exceeding follow limits); iterative removal must alternate between rows and columns via transpose to catch vertical blocks; grids can change dimensions during processing, so stability checks (comparing old/new sizes) are essential; 4s seem to represent "resolved" or "solid" fills, while 1s are tentative or empty; the process assumes input grids with 1,4,7 (and temp 8), but outputs should only have 1 and 4; missing all-1 columns can prevent trimming, leading to oversized outputs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids or single rows/columns; blocks exactly at size 3 (remove) vs. 2 (keep); propagation stopping at non-1 cells; vertical rules differ in direction and limit (down:2, up:1), suggesting asymmetric puzzle mechanics; no diagonal or other interactions.

(Note: The initial_clean_with_temp, vertical_propagation_down/up, and simple_clean_trigger functions are partially helpful for propagation logic but are flawed in handling temp markers and follow limits, leading to over-filling; they should be refined or replaced in future attempts. No types like classes were used, but List[List[int]] is key for grid representation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Incorrect; generated over-propagated 1s to 4s in row 4 (positions 4-6 should be 1,1,4 but became 1,1,4? Wait, actually row 5: generated [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4] vs. expected [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4], so positions 4-5 incorrectly filled to 4s instead of staying 1s or partial, and position 7 is 4 instead of 1, likely from excessive horizontal/vertical propagation without proper limits.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated a larger 7x9 grid with extra 4s and 1s (e.g., row 0 has extra [4,4,4] at end, row 2 has full [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1] vs. expected trimmed [1,1,1,4,1,4]), failing to trim properly and over-retaining columns after the first all-1; dimensions don't match expected 7x6, indicating broken iterative removal or transpose issues.
 * Training example 3: Correct; the rules worked as-is for this case, likely a simpler grid without complex propagation needs.
 * Training example 4: Incorrect; generated a 7x9 grid missing right-side extensions (expected 5x12? Wait, expected has 5 rows shown but implies more; actually, generated rows 0-2 have 9 cols vs. expected 12, e.g., row 0: [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1] vs. [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], so trimming happened too early or propagation didn't extend rightward enough; row 3 in generated [1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1] misses expected's longer tail and position mismatches like extra 4s.
 * Overall: Iterative block removal works for basic cases (as in training 3) but fails to stabilize in complex grids (training 2/4); propagation over-fills 1s to 4s beyond limits (training 1); temp marking with 8 helps but vertical up/down asymmetry isn't fully captured, leading to asymmetric errors; transpose is essential and correct; trim_left_of_first_all1 is helpful but triggers prematurely if no all-1 column is created; simple_clean_trigger is broken for not handling temps properly and over-propagating without directionality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (8 rows x 10 cols) does not look correct; it retains a full-width pattern with alternating 1/4 in early rows (e.g., rows 1-3: [4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4,4,1]) and lower block of 1s, but mentally applying rules: initial grid likely has 7s/1s triggering horizontal cleans to 4s (e.g., columns 1,3,5,7 might propagate vertically down 2/up 1, filling more 1s to 4s in rows 4-7), followed by possible removal of any 3+ all-filled rows (none obvious), and trimming from first all-1 column (potentially column 9 or 10 if propagated, but generated doesn't trim at all, keeping 10 cols); this suggests failure in propagation (under-filling lower right 1s?) and trimming (no all-1 column detected, perhaps because vertical propagation didn't create one); output has inconsistent widths? (last row [1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] implies 10 cols, but no stabilization); it mismatches expected behavior by not simplifying the repeating pattern, likely needing more iterative removes after propagation to collapse vertical filled blocks.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 04:20:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where input grids of 1s and 4s (likely representing filled and empty cells in a pattern or shape) need to be transformed by identifying and removing or simplifying specific structural elements like borders, fillers, or redundant blocks to match a cleaner, expected output shape. The goal appears to be extracting a core pattern while preserving key features, possibly akin to image segmentation or puzzle simplification, but the exact rules involve pattern recognition beyond simple row removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use 1s (possibly "filled" or "on" cells) and 4s (possibly "empty" or "off" cells); 7s are mentioned in the code but absent in all examples, suggesting they may be a red herring or for edge cases not present here—avoid assuming their presence.
 * Expected outputs are often smaller or reshaped compared to inputs/generated, implying cropping, removal of outer borders, or elimination of uniform filler rows/columns (e.g., all-4s borders in example 1).
 * Large blocks of uniform rows (e.g., all-1s or all-4s) should be removed or condensed, but only if they represent non-essential parts like padding; smaller blocks must be preserved to maintain shape integrity (e.g., example 1 expected keeps partial 1s but trims widths).
 * Patterns involve connected components or "blobs" of 1s that form shapes; the code's row-based removal misses column-wise or 2D structure, leading to mismatches in shape (e.g., example 2 expected has irregular widths and fewer rows).
 * Subtle asymmetry: Outputs preserve irregular edges (e.g., example 4 expected has extended 1s in some rows), so processing can't be purely symmetric or row-only—must handle varying row lengths or implicit trimming.
 * No all-1 rows in most examples, but code assumes them after 7 replacement; this over-simplifies and fails when patterns are mixed (e.g., example 1 generated adds extra 1s incorrectly).
 * Consider 2D connectivity: 1s may form objects that span rows/columns, requiring flood-fill or component detection rather than linear scans.
 * Width inconsistencies: Generated outputs sometimes have mismatched column counts (e.g., example 1 generated has ~13 cols vs. expected 8), suggesting the code doesn't trim columns or handle variable widths.
 * Example 3 succeeded (implying the row-block removal worked for that specific case), but failures elsewhere show it's not general—likely because example 3 had the exact large all-1 block condition.

                for j in range(start, i):
                    result.append(processed[j])
        else:
            result.append(processed[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on replacing 7s (irrelevant, as no 7s appear) and removing large vertical all-1 row blocks, which worked for training example 3 (correctly eliminated a qualifying block) but failed for examples 1,2,4 by not addressing horizontal trimming, mixed patterns, or 2D connectivity.
 * In example 1, generated output retained extra columns of 1s (e.g., first row ends with five 1s vs. expected all-4s row) and mismatched inner patterns (e.g., row 3 has 4,1,1,1,... vs. expected 4,1,1,4,...), likely because row-only removal ignored border stripping—result is wider and incorrectly filled.
 * Example 2 generated a taller/wider grid with untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 1 has nine 1s vs. expected six elements total per row) and failed to condense the bottom all-1 row, differing from expected's compact, irregular shape (e.g., row 3 expected [1,1,1,4,1,4] vs. generated longer mixed row)—shows code doesn't handle variable widths or small blocks properly.
 * Example 4 generated kept extra rows and mismatched 1s placement (e.g., row 3 ends with three 1s vs. expected four 1s then 4s; row 5 has all-1 middle vs. expected with 4s), indicating no column-wise processing or shape extraction—output is bulkier and less trimmed.
 * Overall, the approach is too linear (row-focused) and assumes all-1 blocks as the only removable element, missing subtleties like border detection (common all-4s frames) or object isolation; no 2D functions like connected components were used, leading to shape distortions.
 * Function `remove_large_all_one_blocks` is partially helpful for vertical fillers but broken for general cases (e.g., doesn't trim columns, ignores all-4s, mishandles <3 blocks by keeping them verbatim)—avoid using without 2D extensions; `is_all_one` is basic but extendable to `is_uniform` for 4s.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears mostly unprocessed, retaining the full 10-column width and 8 rows with minimal changes (e.g., top row all-4s, middle alternating 4-1 patterns, bottom with clustered 1s), which does not look correct as it lacks the trimming/ simplification seen in expected training outputs (e.g., no removal of border rows/columns, resulting in a rigid grid vs. likely expected compact shape).
 * It fails to account for patterns like the alternating 4-1 rows (rows 2-4), which might represent a removable border or stripe, and the bottom 1s cluster (rows 5-8), which could need condensing—output keeps everything, differing from examples where similar clusters are reshaped (e.g., example 1 trimmed widths).
 * Without the true expected test output, it's unclear, but the lack of any block removal (no large all-1 rows present) means the code did nothing meaningful, suggesting it won't handle test cases with mixed or horizontal patterns—add column processing and 2D detection to fix.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colored pixels in a visual diagram (1 for filled blue elements to remove as filler, 4 for empty yellow background to condense, 7 for dark red elements to convert to background), with the goal of simplifying the grid by removing uniform blocks of filler or background in rows and columns while preserving the core yellow pixel structures and enclosures, often resulting in a resized grid that matches a cleaner, expected outline.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 4s first to eliminate dark red intrusions without affecting yellow positions.
 * Uniform blocks of 1s (all-1 rows/columns) represent filler blue masses that should be removed if they form large consecutive blocks, but smaller or non-uniform ones must be preserved to avoid distorting enclosures.
 * Uniform blocks of 4s (all-4 rows/columns) represent empty background that can be condensed or removed, but only larger blocks to avoid over-trimming essential spacing around yellow components.
 * Process iteratively until the grid stabilizes (no size change), alternating row and column removals to handle both directions, but order matters—removing empty rows first simplifies background before tackling filler.
 * Transposition is key for column processing, but ragged grids (uneven row lengths) need padding with 4s to avoid errors.
 * Subtlety: min_block=1 is too aggressive, removing even single uniform rows/columns, which collapses structures prematurely; higher thresholds (e.g., 2+) might preserve small details like thin borders or isolated pixels.
 * Preserve approximate yellow pixel count by selective removal—over-removal leads to mismatched shapes; enclosures (blue around yellow) should adjust but not vanish.
 * Error handling: Ensure output is a valid rectangular list-of-lists; transposition on non-rectangular grids can cause format errors if not padded properly.
 * Grids may start rectangular but become ragged after row removal, requiring re-padding or reshaping before column processing.
 * Puzzle likely aims for a "minimal bounding" or "cropped" version, removing outer/inner uniform borders but keeping internal variations that define shapes (e.g., don't remove a single 1-column if it's part of a pattern).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt focused on iterative removal of uniform 1 and 4 blocks in rows and columns after replacing 7s, which correctly handles basic background simplification and filler removal in concept but fails due to over-aggressive min_block=1, leading to excessive trimming.
 * Training example 1: Generated a 6x10 grid with preserved internal 1s but failed to remove enough left/right columns and bottom rows, resulting in extra 4s on edges and mismatched shape (e.g., expected has 7 rows x 8 cols with cleaner borders; generated keeps irregular 1-clusters like [1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,4] instead of condensing to [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]).
 * Training example 2: Generated a 6x8 grid that partially condenses but retains unwanted 4-columns and doesn't align rows properly (e.g., expected 7x6 with specific patterns like bottom [1,4,4,4,1,1]; generated has [1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows that don't match vertical alignments, possibly due to row removal order distorting columns).
 * Training example 3: Complete failure with ERROR due to invalid grid format (likely ragged list after removals, breaking transposition; expected unknown but highlights need for rectangular output enforcement).
 * Training example 4: Generated 7x9 grid that keeps too many 4s in middle rows and doesn't extend right side properly (e.g., expected 5x12 with longer rows like [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; generated truncates to shorter widths and mismatches bottom patterns like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]).
 * Overall, the iterative loop stabilizes size but removes too much (min_block=1 collapses singles), leading to shape distortion; transposition helps but padding assumes original width, causing artifacts in processed grids.
 * Function `remove_empty_row_blocks` and similar are helpful for background but need higher min_block to avoid over-removal; `program` main loop is a good skeleton but order (rows before columns) and lack of post-processing (e.g., re-padding) cause mismatches.
 * No extraction of objects (e.g., identifying connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for subtle enclosure preservation; current approach treats uniformly but ignores connectivity.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x8 grid with repeating [4,1,4,1,...] patterns in top rows and denser 1s below, which does not look correct as it appears overly striped and uniform in a way that suggests over-removal of 4-blocks without condensing the overall structure—likely the result of aggressive single-row/column stripping, leaving a checkerboard-like artifact instead of a simplified shape.
 * It fails to match expected puzzle logic (mentally simulating: test input seems like a frame or enclosure with internal yellow; output should crop outer 4-borders and remove internal blue fillers, yielding a tighter 6-7x6-7 grid with preserved irregular 1-clusters, but generated keeps unnecessary 4s in columns 2,4,6 and doesn't align bottom density properly).
 * Test output mismatches by not reducing dimensions enough (stays 8x8 vs. probable smaller expected) and introduces artificial repetition (e.g., rows 1-3 identical [4,1,4,1,4,4,1,4]), indicating the iteration over-trims without merging components—does not make sense for a visual cleanup, as it looks fragmented rather than cohesive.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where cells are represented by numbers (1 for filled, 4 for empty, 7 for special filled variants), and the goal is to iteratively remove or collapse uniform blocks of filled cells (treating 7s as 1s) in rows and columns to reveal or extract a core shape or structure, while preserving non-uniform patterns. The process stabilizes when no more changes occur, but the exact rules involve detecting and omitting entire blocks of consecutive 1s (min size 1 in the attempt) without over-removing connected components or borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s must be treated as filled (1s) for block detection but may have subtle roles in connectivity or preservation (e.g., they might prevent removal in some contexts, but the attempt converts them early).
 * Blocks of consecutive all-1 rows or columns (uniform filler) are removed if they represent "empty" or redundant space, but only if they are isolated or surrounding; connected 1s in shapes should not be fully removed.
 * The process is iterative across rows and columns (requiring transposition for columns), and it must alternate until the grid dimensions stabilize to avoid infinite loops or over-trimming.
 * Grids can be ragged (uneven row lengths), so padding with 4s during transposition is necessary to handle columns properly.
 * Subtle element: Removal should preserve the relative positions of non-uniform rows/columns, but the attempt over-removes in some cases, leaving extra 1s or failing to collapse shapes fully (e.g., not accounting for diagonal or partial connections).
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs often have trimmed borders (all-4 rows/columns removed) but retain irregular shapes; uniform 1-blocks are omitted only if they don't contribute to the core pattern, and grid sizes shrink accordingly.
 * Considerations from attempts: Alternate row and column processing order matters (row-first then column-first may cause asymmetries); check for stability by tracking height/width changes; avoid removing single rows if they are part of a larger structure.
 * All examples show that generated outputs retain more 1s or larger grids than expected, suggesting the removal criteria is too aggressive or doesn't detect "blocks" correctly (e.g., min_block=1 removes too much, perhaps needs min_block>1 or shape-aware detection).
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, which might be needed to identify preservable shapes vs. removable fillers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_one(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Replace all 7s with 1s to treat them as filled cells for block detection."""
    return [[1 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful for unifying 7s and 1s early, as seen in all examples where 7s appear.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    """Check if a row consists entirely of 1s for detecting uniform filler blocks."""
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)
```
(Useful for identifying removable uniform rows; could be extended to check columns via transposition.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to process columns as rows, padding with 4s if ragged."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    h = len(grid)
    w = max((len(row) for row in grid), default=0)
    t = [[4 for _ in range(h)] for _ in range(w)]
    for r in range(h):
        for c in range(min(w, len(grid[r]))):
            t[c][r] = grid[r][c]
    return t
```
(Essential for handling columns symmetrically; padding prevents index errors in ragged grids.)

The main `program` function's iterative loop (while dimensions change) is conceptually helpful for stabilization but broken in implementation (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails on 3/4 training examples by over-retaining 1s and failing to shrink the grid to match expected trimmed shapes (e.g., Train 1 generated has 7 rows x 12 cols with extra 1-blocks in bottom-left, while expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s in positions like row 4 col 8-10).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated keeps a large all-1 block in rows 5-6 cols 9-12 and scattered 1s, but expected removes them entirely and trims right side (e.g., expected row 4: [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] vs generated [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,4,4,1]); unknown why, possibly because row removal doesn't propagate column collapses fully.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 6 rows x 9 cols with extra all-4 row and untrimmed 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has extra 1s at ends), while expected is 7x6 with bottom row [1,4,4,4,1,1] and no extra width; attempt fails to remove partial column blocks or transpose back correctly.
 * Train 3 correct: The iterative removal stabilized to the exact expected shape, suggesting it works for simple cases without ragged edges or complex interconnections (no details provided, but implies uniform blocks were purely removable).
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated 7x9 with irregular 1s (e.g., row 6 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1] has extra 1 at end), while expected is 5x12 with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 0 has 12 cols with trailing 1s); attempt under-removes columns, leaving width too narrow and missing extensions.
 * The `remove_all_one_row_blocks` function is helpful but broken: It skips all consecutive all-1 rows correctly but doesn't handle partial blocks or re-check after column removal, leading to asymmetric results.
 * `remove_all_one_column_blocks` is helpful via transposition but not fully: Transposing back after processing can misalign if original was ragged, causing padding artifacts (e.g., extra 4s turning into preserved rows).
 * Overall attempt over-relies on min_block=1, which removes too aggressively in shapes but not enough in borders; no connected component analysis, so it can't distinguish filler from structure.
 * Function `program` loop is essential for iteration but incorrect: It breaks on dimension equality too early or doesn't alternate row/col enough times, leaving residual 1s.
 * No unhelpful functions to avoid yet, but the current block detection ignores 4s in mixed rows, which is fine; future attempts should add blob extraction to preserve shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It shows 8 rows x 10 cols with top 1 row of all 4s (likely a border not trimmed), alternating 1/4 patterns in rows 1-3 (preserved but perhaps should be collapsed if uniform columns), and a bottom block of 1s in rows 4-7 with partial 4s in row 7, but expected likely trims the top all-4 row, collapses the alternating columns (e.g., every other column is all-1s or near, which should remove to shrink width), and shapes the bottom into a more compact form without the trailing 1s in row 7 col 9-10.
 * Differences: Generated retains full 10-col width with alternating stripes (cols 1,3,5,7,9 are mostly 1s, cols 0,2,4,6,8 are 4s/1s), but puzzle rules probably require removing uniform 1-columns (e.g., col 1 might be all 1s after row removal, shrinking to 8 cols or less); bottom 1-block is over-preserved as four full 1-rows, while expected might remove some if they are filler or adjust for the partial row 7.
 * It makes partial sense (borders partially trimmed, shape vaguely visible), but fails to fully collapse the striped pattern and bottom block, suggesting the iterative loop stops prematurely or doesn't detect column uniforms after row changes; this mirrors Train 1/2/4 issues with incomplete trimming.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where the goal is to simplify or clean a 2D grid (likely representing a puzzle like a nonogram or filled/empty cells) by treating special markers (7s) as filled cells (1s) and then removing large uniform filler blocks of 1s (3 or more consecutive all-1 rows or columns) while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and the overall structure. The process involves row-wise cleaning first, followed by column-wise cleaning via transposition, to eliminate expansive empty or filler areas without disrupting key puzzle elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 7s are placeholders for filled cells (1s) and must be replaced early to ensure they are treated as part of potential filler blocks during detection.
 * Only blocks of exactly 3 or more consecutive all-1 rows (or columns, after transposition) are removed; smaller blocks (1-2 rows/columns) or rows/columns with any non-1 cells must be preserved to avoid over-trimming essential puzzle features.
 * Row processing happens before column processing, which can create cascading effects—e.g., row removal might shorten the grid, affecting subsequent column block detection.
 * Transposition is crucial for columns but must handle variable grid dimensions correctly (e.g., if rows are removed, the transposed grid's "height" changes, and transposing back must realign properly).
 * Grids may have irregular shapes post-processing (fewer rows/columns), but the output should remain a rectangular list-of-lists, potentially with implicit padding or just the trimmed content.
 * Subtle issue: All-1 detection is strict (every cell in the row/column must be 1); mixed rows (e.g., with 4s or other values) block removal even if mostly 1s.
 * Potential over-removal: If large 1-blocks span both rows and columns, the sequential order (rows first) might remove more than intended if the puzzle requires preserving interconnected structures.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single rows/columns, or no 7s/1s; also, 4s seem to represent empty or boundary cells that should not be altered directly.
 * Puzzle likely involves detecting "objects" or blobs of 1s, but current approach only removes uniform lines, not arbitrary shapes—may need blob extraction for better object handling.
 * After removal, the grid might need re-rectangularization or alignment, but examples show direct list outputs without padding.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: INCORRECT—generated output retained extra columns and rows with 1s (e.g., trailing [1,1,1,1,1] in row 0, mixed 1/4 patterns in later rows/columns), while expected trimmed to a more compact 8-column grid by removing large 1-blocks on the right and bottom; difference likely due to incomplete column removal after row processing, preserving 2-row 1-blocks that should have been targeted post-transposition.
 * Training example 2: INCORRECT—generated output added an extra all-4 row and expanded to 9 columns with trailing 1s/4s (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,4]), while expected is 6 columns with precise 1/4 patterns; over-preservation of small 1-blocks and failure to trim column-wise after row removal caused bloating, missing the expected shortening.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—program successfully removed appropriate large 1-blocks without over-trimming, matching expected (details not shown, but indicates the core logic works for some cases with balanced row/column uniforms).
 * Training example 4: INCORRECT—generated output shortened to 7 rows but retained extra 1-blocks (e.g., row 0 ends with [1,1,1,1,1], row 2 has [4,4,4,1,1,1]), while expected has 5 rows with extended 1s on right (up to 12 columns) and specific patterns; under-removal of row blocks and misalignment in transposition led to lost content and dimension mismatch.
 * Overall, the replace_sevens_to_one and is_all_one functions are helpful and correct for initial setup and detection.
 * The remove_large_all_one_row_blocks function works well for rows but fails in sequence with columns, as post-row grid changes aren't fully accounted for in transposition (e.g., variable lengths cause partial preservation of large blocks).
 * Transpose and remove_large_all_one_column_blocks are conceptually helpful but broken in practice—transposing a non-rectangular grid (after row removal) may produce ragged lists, leading to incorrect back-transposition and dimension errors in examples 1,2,4.
 * No object extraction functions were used; adding blob detection (e.g., connected 1-components) might help identify non-uniform "objects" to preserve, as current line-based removal misses subtle puzzle elements like irregular shapes.
 * Sequential order (rows before columns) is a subtlety that worked for example 3 but caused cascading errors elsewhere—reversing or iterating until stable might be needed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but incomplete or misaligned: it shows 8 rows with 10 columns, starting with full 4-rows (row 0), alternating 4/1 patterns (rows 1-3), and bottom-heavy 1-blocks (rows 4-7), which suggests some column trimming occurred (e.g., alternating pattern implies removal of uniform 1-columns), but it does not look fully cleaned—e.g., rows 4-7 have long trailing 1s ([1,1,1,1,1,1]) that might form removable column blocks if processed iteratively, and the grid seems wider than necessary compared to potential puzzle intent.
 * It does not match a mentally simulated "correct" output under the rules: assuming the input has large vertical 1-blocks on the right (based on patterns), full removal should trim to ~6-8 columns with preserved alternating tops and a compact bottom blob; current output retains too many 1s in columns 5-9 (e.g., all 1s from row 4 down), indicating the column removal didn't catch 4+ consecutive 1s post-row processing—likely a transposition issue with the shortened grid.
 * The output makes sense for partial filler removal (e.g., no large all-1 rows were present, so row step passed through; column step trimmed some alternations) but not correct overall, as it leaves expandable 1-areas that violate the "remove 3+" rule in columns—update needed: make transposition handle ragged edges by padding or process columns directly without full transpose.
 * No 7s visible, so replacement step is neutral; if test has hidden large blocks, the non-iterative approach misses them.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle processing task where the goal is to clean a grid representation (using numbers like 4 for empty/background cells and 1 or 7 for filled/foreground cells) by iteratively removing large uniform blocks of filled cells (consecutive all-1 rows or columns of length 2 or more) to reveal the core puzzle structure, while preserving smaller blocks, non-uniform rows/columns, and treating 7s as equivalent to 1s for detection purposes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The process must iterate until the grid dimensions stabilize (no more changes in row or column count), applying row block removal followed by column block removal in each iteration to handle interactions between rows and columns.
 * Only remove blocks of 2 or more consecutive all-1 rows/columns; single all-1 rows/columns or non-all-1 rows/columns must be preserved, as they may represent important puzzle elements like thin lines or partial fills.
 * 7s are special filled cells that should be treated as 1s only for block detection but possibly retained as 7s in output if not part of removed blocks (though the current approach converts them to 1s outright, which may over-simplify).
 * Transposition is key for handling columns symmetrically to rows, but care must be taken to ensure the grid remains rectangular after processing (padding or errors could occur if not).
 * Subtle issue: Large blocks might form after initial removals due to alignment, so iteration is essential; however, over-removal can occur if min_block=2 is too aggressive for some cases where "large" should vary or consider context.
 * Preserve overall shape but shrink dimensions by removing entire rows/columns, not individual cells; this simulates cropping out uniform filler regions in a visual puzzle.
 * Potential miss: Non-uniform rows with mostly 1s but some 4s should not be removed, even if they contribute to vertical alignment of blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids, single-row/column grids, or grids where blocks wrap around (but no wrapping assumed); also, after transposition and back, ensure cell values aren't altered unintentionally.
 * The puzzle likely represents a nonogram or similar where large uniform areas are "noise" to remove, but small ones are part of the image.

 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training example 3, preserving the intended structure without over-removal, indicating the core iteration and min_block=2 logic works for some cases with balanced row/column interactions.
 * For training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated output retained extra 1-filled areas on the right and bottom (e.g., columns of 1s in positions 9-13 and extra rows), while expected output cropped more aggressively to a tighter 8-column/7-row shape with specific 1 placements (e.g., expected has no trailing 1s in row 1, and different 1 patterns in rows 5-6); this suggests the iteration didn't remove interdependent row-column blocks fully, leaving residual large vertical 1 blocks.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with extra full rows/columns of 4s and 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s extended to 9 cols, row 7 all 1s), while expected is smaller 7-row/6-column with trimmed edges (e.g., no extra 4s in row 1 cols 7-9, and row 7 has mixed 1/4 without full extension); over-preservation of non-large blocks or failure to iterate enough led to bloated dimensions.
 * For training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7-row/9-column grid with incomplete cropping (e.g., retained extra 1s in rows 1-3 cols 5-9 and mismatched patterns like row 5 all 1s in cols 2-7), while expected is 5-row/12-column with extended 1s on right (e.g., row 1 has 12 elements with more 1s, and only 5 rows total); this indicates under-removal of horizontal blocks and failure to expand/preserve width correctly, possibly due to transposition issues or early convergence in iteration.
 * The program's iteration loop (while dimensions change) is helpful but may converge prematurely if row/column removals don't alternate enough times; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components) was attempted, which might be needed for non-uniform filled areas but isn't in this code.
 * Function `replace_sevens_to_one` is helpful for unifying 7s/1s but may be too aggressive if 7s need distinct treatment post-detection.
 * Functions like `is_all_one`, `remove_large_all_one_row_blocks`, and `transpose` are essential and correct for uniform block detection, but the composed `program` lacks handling for cases where blocks are larger than min_block=2 in complex patterns.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the overall approach misses subtleties like potentially adjusting min_block dynamically or detecting blocks in both directions simultaneously.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 8-row/10-column grid with a full top row of 4s, three alternating 4-1 rows, and bottom rows shifting from alternating to mostly 1s with some 4s (e.g., row 5-7 start with 1,4,1,4,1 then 1s; row 8 has 1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1), which appears to have removed some central uniform areas but retained potentially large vertical 1 blocks on the right (cols 6-10 in rows 5-8).
 * This does not look fully correct without the input grid, but mentally simulating typical puzzle rules (iterative removal of >=2 all-1 rows/cols after 7->1 conversion), it seems incomplete—likely over-retained a bottom block of near-uniform 1s that should be cropped if they form large consecutive columns, and the alternating top pattern (rows 2-4) might represent preserved thin lines but could need further column removal to tighten; compared to training mismatches, it risks similar bloating as example 2.
 * The output makes partial sense for cropping large top/left empties (all-4 row preserved as boundary?), but fails to fully stabilize, as the bottom-right 1 cluster looks like a removable vertical block of size >2; to handle test, future updates should add more iteration passes or detect partial-uniform blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-processing puzzle similar to simplifying a Nonogram or logic grid by removing redundant uniform blocks of filled cells (1s, including 7s treated as 1s) and empty cells (4s), focusing on large consecutive rows or columns to collapse the grid to its essential pattern without altering non-uniform or small blocks. The goal is to iteratively trim these blocks until the grid stabilizes, preserving the core visual structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace 7s with 1s early, as they represent filled cells equivalent to 1s for block detection but may indicate special cases like hints or overlaps.
 * Distinguish between filled blocks (1s): remove even single all-1 rows/columns (min_block=1), as they often represent thin borders or fillers; empty blocks (4s): only remove if 3+ consecutive (min_block=3), to avoid over-trimming sparse empty areas.
 * Process iteratively in a loop (rows then columns, alternating) until dimensions stabilize, as removals can create new uniform blocks; transpose for column handling.
 * Preserve non-uniform rows/columns entirely, and small blocks (< min_block) to maintain pattern details like partial fills or edges.
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), so handle empty or uneven grids gracefully; expected outputs often show collapsed borders, revealing asymmetric or irregular core shapes.
 * Subtle: Uniform blocks must be strictly all-1 or all-4; mixed cells (e.g., 1s with 4s) block removal. In examples, top/bottom/left/right borders are often trimmed differently based on uniformity.
 * Potential over-removal: Aggressive min=1 for 1s can collapse too much if patterns have thin filled lines; under-removal happens if iteration misses propagated changes.
 * Shape mismatches in outputs indicate failures in transposition or block counting, e.g., expected grids are often shorter/wider than generated.
 * No rotation or cell-value changes beyond 7->1; focus on deletion of entire rows/columns.

(Note: Column versions via transpose are helpful but derived; no custom types needed beyond List[List[int]]. No object extraction functions were present or relevant here, as the puzzle is about grid simplification, not entity detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles 7->1 replacement and iterative row/column processing with different min_blocks, succeeding on Training 3 (exact match, likely due to balanced uniform borders).
 * Failed on Training 1: Generated kept extra 1-filled and 4-mixed rows/columns (e.g., retained bottom all-1 rows and irregular 4/1 mixes), resulting in taller/wider grid than expected; did not trim enough thin 1-blocks or propagated 4-blocks, leaving artifacts like [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1] rows instead of full collapse to borders.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated mismatched shape entirely (9 cols vs. expected 6), with extra 4-rows and misaligned 1/4 patterns (e.g., kept full all-4 row at bottom, altered [1,4,1,1,1,1] to include extras); transposition likely caused width errors, and min=3 for 4s didn't remove enough vertical empties.
 * Failed on Training 4: Generated shorter and differently shaped (e.g., 7 rows vs. expected 5, with misplaced 4-blocks like [1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), failing to preserve small 1-clusters or trim asymmetric 4-borders correctly; iteration stopped prematurely without stabilizing to expected collapsed form.
 * Overall, the uniform block detection works for simple cases but breaks on asymmetric or mixed patterns due to over-preservation of small blocks and incomplete propagation in columns.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the min_block=1 for 1s is too aggressive in some cases (collapses valid thin lines), while min=3 for 4s is insufficient for vertical empties in examples 2/4; no broken functions, but lack of diagonal or partial-block handling (not needed).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it appears to have trimmed a top all-4 row (assuming input had one) and some right-side 1-clusters, revealing a striped pattern of alternating 4/1 columns in the top and a solid 1-block bottom, which could be a core "flag" or shape.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: the bottom section has repeated [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] rows with minor variations, suggesting incomplete removal of small vertical 4-columns (e.g., the single 4s in col 2/4/6 should perhaps form removable blocks if >=3 vertically, but weren't); expected likely more collapsed, e.g., merging the bottom 1-block fully and trimming isolated 4s, resulting in a tighter 6-8 row grid without the repetitive [1,4,1,4,1,...] stripes if they are uniform vertically.
 * Differences: Generated retains what looks like thin 4-columns (e.g., col 2 is mostly 4s but interrupted), which should be removed if all-4 vertically >=3; this mismatches potential expected by keeping "filler" stripes instead of collapsing to a solid pattern—unknown if input had 7s affecting this, but output feels under-trimmed compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving a 2D list of integers (primarily 1s, 4s, and possibly 7s), where the goal is to process the grid by replacing 7s with 4s and then iteratively removing or collapsing short uniform blocks of rows and columns consisting entirely of 1s or 4s, based on minimum length thresholds, until the grid stabilizes, resulting in a "collapsed" or simplified version that matches expected patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Replace all 7s with 4s at the start, as 7s appear to be a temporary or alias marker for 4s in the puzzle logic.
 * Identify and remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 1s, but only if the block length is below a minimum threshold (e.g., <2 in the attempt, but this may be incorrect based on failures).
 * Similarly, remove contiguous blocks of rows that are entirely 4s if below a different minimum threshold (e.g., <3 in the attempt, potentially wrong).
 * Apply the same logic to columns by transposing the grid, processing, and transposing back, to handle vertical blocks.
 * Iterate the row and column removal process in a loop until no further changes occur (e.g., grid dimensions stabilize).
 * Subtlety: Removals should effectively "collapse" the grid by bringing remaining parts together, but the attempt's logic keeps short blocks instead of removing them— this inversion (keeping short vs. removing long/short) may be a key error, as expected outputs show more aggressive removal of patterns.
 * Subtlety: Thresholds may vary or be different (e.g., remove 1-blocks if >=2 or < some value; the attempt's min_block=2 for 1s and 3 for 4s leads to incomplete collapses, leaving extra 1s/4s).
 * Order matters: The attempt processes rows first, then columns via transpose, but alternating or repeating more finely might be needed; also, changes propagate (e.g., removing a row can create new uniform columns).
 * Grids can change shape (height/width decreases), and empty grids or single cells need handling (attempt assumes non-empty).
 * Potential miss: Not all uniform blocks are rows/columns—perhaps diagonal or irregular shapes, but evidence suggests only full row/column uniforms.
 * After replacement, only 1s and 4s remain, so logic focuses on those; other numbers (if any) are preserved.
 * Loop termination via dimension check is good, but attempt's while loop may over- or under-process due to wrong removal criteria.
 * Expected outputs are smaller/simpler, suggesting removals eliminate more than the attempt does (e.g., short blocks are kept, but should be removed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List

def replace_sevens_to_four(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[4 if cell == 7 else cell for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(This is helpful and correct for initial processing, as 7s consistently become 4s in examples.)

```python
def is_all_one(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(cell == 1 for cell in row)

def is_all_four(row: List[int]) -> bool:

```
(These are basic and useful for detecting uniform rows; could extend to columns directly.)

```python
def transpose(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(h)] for c in range(w)]
```
(This is essential and correct for handling columns symmetrically.)

```python
def remove_all_one_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_one(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_one(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Note: This keeps short blocks; may need inversion to remove them
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result

def remove_all_four_row_blocks(grid: List[List[int]], min_block: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while i < n:
        if is_all_four(grid[i]):
            start = i
            while i < n and is_all_four(grid[i]):
                i += 1
            if i - start < min_block:  # Same note: Keeps short; likely should remove short/long differently
                result += grid[start:i]
        else:
            result.append(grid[i])
            i += 1
    return result
```
(These are helpful for block detection but flawed in action: they append short blocks to result (keeping them) while skipping long ones (effectively removing long), which is inverted from likely intent—expected outputs remove more, suggesting remove if < min_block. Adapt for columns via transpose.)

(The overall program structure with iteration until no change is a good skeleton, but thresholds and keep/remove logic need fixing; no object extraction needed, as it's grid-level processing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it failed all 4 training examples due to incomplete removals, leaving extra rows/columns of 1s and 4s that should have been collapsed.
 * Train 1: Generated a 7x13 grid with scattered 1s in lower rows (e.g., row 6 has [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1]), but expected is 7x8 with cleaner borders and fewer 1s (e.g., row 6 is all 4s except positions matching a pattern); difference: attempt kept short 1-blocks and didn't propagate column removals fully, leaving dangling 1s on the right.
 * Train 2: Generated 7x9 with extra full 4-rows and misaligned 1s (e.g., row 2 all 4s kept, row 3 has [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1]), but expected 7x6 with tighter pattern (e.g., row 6 [1,4,1,4,1,1]); difference: over-kept 4-blocks and didn't remove short 1-columns, resulting in wider grid and wrong positions.
 * Train 3: Generated 9x3 with extra all-1 and all-4 rows (e.g., rows 4-5 all 4s kept, row 5 [1,1,1] kept), but expected 6x3 with only specific [4,1,4] and all-4 rows; difference: kept short uniform blocks instead of removing them, adding unnecessary rows and failing to collapse vertically.
 * Train 4: Generated 7x9 with fragmented 1s and 4s (e.g., row 3 [4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1], row 6 [1,1,4,1,1,1,1,4,1]), but expected 5x12 with extended patterns (e.g., row 1 ends in more 1s); difference: didn't extend or remove properly, leading to shorter/wrong-width grid and mismatched shapes (unknown why it truncated right side).
 * General issue: The keep-short/remove-long logic is backwards—likely should remove short blocks (< min) to match expectations; thresholds (2 for 1s, 3 for 4s) may be wrong (e.g., try 1 for 1s or 2 for 4s).
 * Transpose-based column handling works in concept but fails propagation in loop due to order (rows before columns each iteration).
 * No object extraction attempted or needed; pure grid processing.
 * Iteration loop detects changes via size, which is helpful but insufficient without correct removal.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x10 grid with patterned 1s and 4s (e.g., rows 2-4 have alternating 4,1 patterns; bottom has clustered 1s), but it does not look correct based on training patterns—expected likely a more collapsed version (e.g., 6-7 rows, removing short 1/4 blocks to tighten the checkerboard-like top and 1-clusters bottom).
 * It keeps what appear to be short uniform segments (e.g., potential short all-4 columns on left not removed), leading to a taller/wider grid than expected; top rows 1-4 suggest incomplete column collapses (alternating should propagate to remove isolated 1s vertically).
 * Bottom rows 5-9 have irregular 1-blocks that weren't fully removed, unlike training where similar clusters collapse more (e.g., Train 1 removes dangling 1s); this mismatches by preserving too much, suggesting same inversion error as training (keeps short blocks).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense as a pre-collapse state but not final—likely incorrect, as it doesn't simplify to a minimal stable grid; to handle test, invert removal logic and tune thresholds (e.g., remove 1-blocks <3, 4-blocks <2) for better propagation in alternating patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells represented by numbers (likely 1 and 7 as filled variants, 4 as empty), where the goal is to process the grid by removing large uniform blocks of filled rows/columns and trimming extraneous parts to reveal a simplified or "core" shape that matches expected outputs. The rules emphasize iterative simplification while preserving small filled blocks and handling special cases like 7s differently from 1s before final trimming.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Filled cells are 1 or 7, but 7s must be replaced with 4s (empty) only after block removal, as they initially count as filled for block detection but become empty for trimming.
 * Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive all-filled rows (or columns via transpose), but preserve smaller blocks (1-2 rows) and any non-filled rows; this must be done iteratively until no changes occur, alternating between rows and columns.
 * After block removal, replace all remaining 7s with 4s to treat them as empty, then find the leftmost column that is entirely 1s (now ignoring 7s) and trim all columns from that point to the right, keeping only the left portion.
 * Grids may not be square; transposing handles column processing, but ensure dimensions are tracked to detect convergence.
 * Subtle: All-1 columns for trimming are checked post-7 replacement, so original 7s in a column don't block it from being all-1 if they become 4s; however, if a column has mixed 1s and 7s, it won't be all-1 after replacement.
 * Easy to miss: The process is compositional—block removal first (iterative with transpose), then 7-to-4 replacement, then trim; skipping iteration or wrong order leads to over-removal or incomplete trimming.
 * Outputs must match exactly in shape and values; even small mismatches (e.g., extra columns or wrong cell values) fail.
 * No removal of small filled blocks or non-uniform rows; preserve patterns like isolated 1s or short filled segments.
 * Consider rectangular grids; trimming can change width but not height unless block removal affects rows.

These functions are helpful for block removal and transposition; they correctly identify and preserve small filled blocks while enabling column processing.

```python
def replace_sevens_to_four(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

These are useful for post-processing: 7-to-4 replacement and all-1 column detection/trimming; they handle the final simplification step accurately when applied in order.

```
This iterative block removal function is helpful but must be applied before trimming; it converges correctly but can over-remove if not preserving small blocks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt implemented iterative block removal (rows and columns via transpose), 7-to-4 replacement, and right-trimming from the first all-1 column, which worked correctly for Training example 3 (exact match, preserving the core shape without over-trimming).
 * For Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x8 grid with extra 1s in rows 2-6 (e.g., positions 3-7 in row 2 are 1s instead of 4s/1s mix), and mismatched patterns like row 3 having all 1s from col 2-7 vs. expected sparse 1s; this suggests block removal didn't preserve small filled segments properly, or trimming cut too early/left too much.
 * For Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid retaining extra columns (e.g., last column all 1s/4s not trimmed), and row 1 has extra 1 and 4 at end vs. expected 7x6 with trimmed width; block removal likely failed to eliminate a large filled row block (row 2 all 4s? but miscounted as filled), leading to wider output.
 * For Training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated a 7x9 grid with incomplete trimming (e.g., extra columns 9-? with 1s/4s), and row 3 has 4s in cols 5-6 instead of 1s, row 5 mismatches in col 7 (1 vs. 4); suggests transpose iteration didn't remove a vertical filled block, or 7 replacement happened too early, altering all-1 detection.
 * Overall, the attempt correctly composed the steps but failed on iteration convergence (didn't remove all large blocks in transposed views) and trimming (found wrong first all-1 column due to lingering 7s or unremoved blocks); no object extraction functions were used, but they aren't relevant here—this is grid-wide processing, not object isolation.
 * Function `process_filled_row_blocks` is helpful but broken in non-convergence for complex grids (e.g., alternating row/column blocks); `trim_right_from_first_all_one` is mostly correct but assumes post-replacement, which works if blocks are fully removed first.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but the full `program` composition is flawed due to order/timing issues in applying steps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is an 8x10 grid that appears over-wide and untrimmed (e.g., columns 8-10 have patterns like 4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 that look like extraneous filled extensions, and no clear all-1 column was trimmed from).
 * It does not look correct: The top rows (1-4) show a checkerboard-like 4/1 pattern extending fully to col 10, but expected likely trims after a left-aligned all-1 column (possibly col 2 or 4, based on vertical 1s in cols 2,4,6,8), resulting in a narrower grid (e.g., 8x4 or 8x6) with preserved bottom filled block; current output retains right-side noise, suggesting trimming failed to detect the first all-1 column post-7 replacement (no 7s visible, but maybe block removal missed a vertical filled block).
 * Bottom rows (5-8) have a solid 1-block from col 3 onward, which might be a preserved small block, but the overall shape doesn't simplify to a "core" puzzle element—likely missing iterative column removal of large 1/7 blocks on the right.
 * To handle the test, ensure transpose removes any large vertical filled blocks (e.g., cols 2/4/6/8 might form partial blocks <3, but right side could have >=3), then trim precisely from the leftmost post-replacement all-1 column.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving manipulation of a matrix where cells are either "filled" (1 or 7) or "empty/background" (4), likely to simplify, normalize, or extract a core pattern such as a shape or object by removing redundant or extraneous elements like large uniform blocks, trimming edges, and cleaning up isolated artifacts. The goal is to transform input grids into expected output grids that preserve key structural features while eliminating noise, with iterative processing across rows and columns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Filled cells (1 or 7) represent structure or foreground, while 4s are background; 7s seem to be a variant of filled that needs normalization to 4 (possibly indicating a different type of fill like shading or error, but treated as removable).
 * Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive entirely filled rows (all 1s or 7s) to eliminate large uniform areas, but retain smaller blocks (1-2 rows); this is iterative until no changes, but does not apply symmetrically to columns in the current program (transpose function exists but unused).
 * After row processing, trim the grid horizontally to the left of the first fully filled column (all rows in that column are 1 or 7), effectively cropping leading empty or partial columns.
 * Replace all 7s with 4s globally to standardize filled cells to 1s only, suggesting 7s are temporary or overlaid fills.
 * Conditionally remove isolated single 1s (not on edges, surrounded by 4s on both sides in the row) only if grid width >5, to clean up noise but avoid over-removal in narrow grids; this targets horizontal isolation but ignores vertical or diagonal contexts.
 * Subtlety: Processing order matters—row block removal first, then column trim, then 7-to-4 replacement, then isolated 1 removal; skipping iterations or wrong order can leave artifacts.
 * No rotation or transpose is applied in the final program, despite the function existing, which might miss vertical symmetries; grids can have varying widths/heights, and assumptions like uniform row lengths must hold.
 * Easy to miss: Filled rows/columns are strictly all 1 or 7—no mixes; isolation check is row-wise only and skips edges; trimming is left-only, not symmetric or right-side.
 * Broader considerations: Puzzle may involve object extraction (e.g., connected components of 1s), but current approach is rule-based simplification rather than full segmentation; test grids may have asymmetric patterns requiring bidirectional trimming or vertical processing.
 * Outputs must match exactly in structure and values, including preserved 1 positions that form the "core" shape.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly implements row-wise large block removal iteratively, 7-to-4 replacement, left-trimming, and conditional isolated 1 removal, which worked for training example 3 (full match, preserving a simple pattern without over-removal).
 * For training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a solid block of 1s in rows 2-5 (e.g., [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4]), but expected has split patterns like [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4] in row 2 and [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4] in row 4; difference is failure to break up or preserve internal 4s/holes within what should be separate objects, possibly due to no column-wise processing or missing vertical isolation rules—over-merged the shape.
 * For training 2 (INCORRECT): Generated keeps extra 1s and 4s in mismatched positions, e.g., row 2 as [4,4,4,4,4,4] (all background) and row 2 expected [4,4,4,4,1,4]; row 6 as [1,4,1,1,1,1] vs expected [1,4,1,4,1,1]—isolated 1 removal didn't trigger or was too aggressive in wrong spots, and trimming left partial columns intact; unknown why row 2 fully backgrounded (possibly erroneous row block removal).
 * For training 3 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected, suggesting the ruleset handles simple, narrow patterns well without needing column removal or advanced isolation.
 * For training 4 (INCORRECT): Generated has shorter widths and mismatched 1 placements, e.g., row 0 [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1] vs expected longer [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]; row 5 [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4] vs expected [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]—trimming cut too much (left-trim removed right extensions), and no handling for vertical fills or right-side preservation; isolated 1s not addressed properly in complex shapes.
 * The iterative row block removal is helpful but incomplete without column equivalent (transpose + remove could fix vertical slabs, as seen in training 1's merged blocks).
 * Isolated 1 removal is conditionally applied but broken for patterns with edge-adjacent or multi-row singles (doesn't catch vertical isolation, leading to artifacts in training 2 and 4).
 * Trimming function is one-sided and post-row-processing, which works for left-empty cases but fails asymmetric test inputs like training 4's extended rights.
 * No object extraction (e.g., connected components) attempted; rules are heuristic but miss subtle connectivity (e.g., 1s connected diagonally or via 7s before replacement).
 * Unhelpful/broken: The transpose is defined but not used in the main program loop, making vertical processing impossible—don't rely on it without integration; the width>5 condition for isolation feels arbitrary and skips narrow cases like training 2.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially processed but likely incorrect: it shows a top all-4 row, three rows with trailing single 1s (e.g., [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1]), and then four rows starting with 1 followed by 4s and a block of 1s (e.g., [1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1]), suggesting left-trim kept some structure but possibly over-trimmed width (original likely wider) and failed to remove vertical filled aspects or isolate the trailing 1s properly.
 * It does not look fully correct because the trailing single 1s in rows 1-3 seem like isolated artifacts that should be removed (similar to training 2's mismatches), and the bottom block looks merged without internal 4s/holes, unlike training 1's expected splits—mentally applying rules, if the input has vertical filled columns or right extensions, the one-sided trim and row-only isolation would leave noise; no large row blocks removed (no all-1/7 rows apparent), but without expected, it mismatches puzzle intent of clean shape extraction.
 * To handle test, program needs bidirectional trimming (left and right to bounding box of 1s) and vertical isolation removal, as current output retains potential edge noise and doesn't normalize to a compact shape.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle solver that applies iterative rules to simplify or "clean" a numerical grid by identifying and removing large blocks of filled (1 or 7) rows/columns, propagating fillings from trigger patterns (like sequences of 7s followed by 1s) horizontally and vertically, and trimming extraneous parts, ultimately transforming the grid into a standardized output with 4s representing filled/propagated areas and 1s as unfilled or partial elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core filling rule: Cells with 1 or 7 are considered "filled"; all-filled rows/columns (every cell filled) in blocks of 3+ consecutive ones must be removed iteratively in both horizontal and vertical directions until the grid stabilizes, preserving smaller blocks (<3).
 * Horizontal cleaning: Sequences starting with 7s are cleaned to 4s; the first 7 is temporarily marked (e.g., with 8) for later propagation, and up to 2 following 1s are also set to 4s; this handles "triggers" but requires careful bounding to avoid over-propagation.
 * Vertical propagation: From temp markers (8) or remaining 7s, propagate downward up to 2 steps (converting 1s to 4s) and upward up to 1 step; this must be done via transposition to treat columns as rows, and reversal for upward direction, but limits prevent infinite loops or over-filling.
 * Trimming: After processing, remove all columns from (and including) the first fully 1-filled column to the end, which acts as a boundary cleaner but can fail if no such column exists or if propagation hasn't created one correctly.
 * Subtleties: Temp marking (8) is crucial for deferred propagation but must be cleaned up; over-propagation of 1s to 4s is a common error (e.g., exceeding follow limits); iterative removal must alternate between rows and columns via transpose to catch vertical blocks; grids can change dimensions during processing, so stability checks (comparing old/new sizes) are essential; 4s seem to represent "resolved" or "solid" fills, while 1s are tentative or empty; the process assumes input grids with 1,4,7 (and temp 8), but outputs should only have 1 and 4; missing all-1 columns can prevent trimming, leading to oversized outputs.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids or single rows/columns; blocks exactly at size 3 (remove) vs. 2 (keep); propagation stopping at non-1 cells; vertical rules differ in direction and limit (down:2, up:1), suggesting asymmetric puzzle mechanics; no diagonal or other interactions.

(Note: The initial_clean_with_temp, vertical_propagation_down/up, and simple_clean_trigger functions are partially helpful for propagation logic but are flawed in handling temp markers and follow limits, leading to over-filling; they should be refined or replaced in future attempts. No types like classes were used, but List[List[int]] is key for grid representation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Incorrect; generated over-propagated 1s to 4s in row 4 (positions 4-6 should be 1,1,4 but became 1,1,4? Wait, actually row 5: generated [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4] vs. expected [4,1,1,1,4,4,1,4], so positions 4-5 incorrectly filled to 4s instead of staying 1s or partial, and position 7 is 4 instead of 1, likely from excessive horizontal/vertical propagation without proper limits.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated a larger 7x9 grid with extra 4s and 1s (e.g., row 0 has extra [4,4,4] at end, row 2 has full [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1] vs. expected trimmed [1,1,1,4,1,4]), failing to trim properly and over-retaining columns after the first all-1; dimensions don't match expected 7x6, indicating broken iterative removal or transpose issues.
 * Training example 3: Correct; the rules worked as-is for this case, likely a simpler grid without complex propagation needs.
 * Training example 4: Incorrect; generated a 7x9 grid missing right-side extensions (expected 5x12? Wait, expected has 5 rows shown but implies more; actually, generated rows 0-2 have 9 cols vs. expected 12, e.g., row 0: [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1] vs. [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], so trimming happened too early or propagation didn't extend rightward enough; row 3 in generated [1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1] misses expected's longer tail and position mismatches like extra 4s.
 * Overall: Iterative block removal works for basic cases (as in training 3) but fails to stabilize in complex grids (training 2/4); propagation over-fills 1s to 4s beyond limits (training 1); temp marking with 8 helps but vertical up/down asymmetry isn't fully captured, leading to asymmetric errors; transpose is essential and correct; trim_left_of_first_all1 is helpful but triggers prematurely if no all-1 column is created; simple_clean_trigger is broken for not handling temps properly and over-propagating without directionality.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (8 rows x 10 cols) does not look correct; it retains a full-width pattern with alternating 1/4 in early rows (e.g., rows 1-3: [4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4,4,1]) and lower block of 1s, but mentally applying rules: initial grid likely has 7s/1s triggering horizontal cleans to 4s (e.g., columns 1,3,5,7 might propagate vertically down 2/up 1, filling more 1s to 4s in rows 4-7), followed by possible removal of any 3+ all-filled rows (none obvious), and trimming from first all-1 column (potentially column 9 or 10 if propagated, but generated doesn't trim at all, keeping 10 cols); this suggests failure in propagation (under-filling lower right 1s?) and trimming (no all-1 column detected, perhaps because vertical propagation didn't create one); output has inconsistent widths? (last row [1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] implies 10 cols, but no stabilization); it mismatches expected behavior by not simplifying the repeating pattern, likely needing more iterative removes after propagation to collapse vertical filled blocks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle solver that processes a grid of cells (using numbers like 1 for filled, 7 for special markers, 4 for cleaned/empty) by iteratively removing large blocks of fully filled rows and columns, handling special 7 markers by converting them and nearby filled cells to cleaned states, and trimming the grid to focus on the core puzzle area up to the first fully filled column. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected patterns, likely representing a solved or reduced form of a logic puzzle like a Nonogram or filled-region diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Remove blocks of 3 or more consecutive all-filled rows (all 1s or 7s) or columns, but preserve smaller blocks (<3) and non-filled rows/columns; this must be done iteratively in both directions (rows then transpose for columns) until the grid stabilizes.
 * Handling 7s: 7s act as special markers; convert each 7 to 4, and clean (set to 4) up to 2 following consecutive 1s in the same row to the right, but do not affect cells beyond that or in other directions; remaining 7s after initial cleaning should also be set to 4 (or sometimes treated as 1 for detection purposes like trimming).
 * Trimming: After processing, identify the leftmost column that is entirely 1s (treating 7s as 1s for this check) and trim the grid to include only columns up to and including that one; ensure row lengths align post-trimming to avoid mismatches.
 * Filled detection: "All-filled" means every cell in a row/column is either 1 or 7; subtle issue: 7s should sometimes be treated as equivalent to 1s for filling checks but distinctly for cleaning.
 * Iteration stability: The removal of filled blocks must alternate between rows and columns via transposition until no more changes occur in grid dimensions, to handle interdependent row/column removals.
 * Grid consistency: Ensure the final grid has uniform row lengths; if trimming uses a temp grid for detection, align the main grid accordingly to prevent length mismatches.
 * Subtle misses: Over-cleaning (e.g., setting too many 1s to 4s beyond rules) or under-cleaning (e.g., not handling 7s in columns) leads to pattern errors; trimming too early or late can cut off expected filled areas; 7s in non-row contexts (e.g., after transposition) may need re-processing.
 * Other considerations: Grids may have varying sizes; empty grids should return empty; preserve non-filled cells exactly; potential for 7s to create "tails" of cleaned cells that affect block detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated a grid with incorrect patterns in rows 3-6, where 1s were not cleaned to 4s in positions like columns 4-7 (e.g., row 3 has [4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4] but expected [4,1,1,4,1,1,4,4]), likely due to over-trimming or insufficient cleaning of 7-related tails; bottom row matched but middle patterns mismatched in filled areas.
 * Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated a much wider grid (9 columns vs. expected 6) with extra 4s and 1s appended (e.g., row 0 [4,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4] vs. expected [4,1,1,1,1,1]), and patterns like row 2 [1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1] missing trims; suggests trimming failed to cut right side properly, and block removal didn't reduce dimensions enough.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): The full process_filled_blocks, clean_right_of_sevens, 7-replacement, and trim_to_first_all_one combination worked perfectly here, indicating the iterative block removal and row-based 7 cleaning handle some symmetric or simple cases well.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated grid is narrower (9 columns vs. expected 12) and missing right-side extensions (e.g., row 0 [4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1] vs. expected with 12 elements including extra 1s and 4s); patterns in rows 3-4 have mismatched 1s/4s (e.g., row 3 [1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1] vs. expected with more 1s and a trailing 4,1); likely trimming cut too much, and cleaning didn't preserve extended filled areas.
 * Overall: process_filled_blocks is helpful for dimension reduction but may remove too aggressively if 7s are misinterpreted as non-filled post-cleaning; clean_right_of_sevens works for row-based 7 tails but is limited to 2 following 1s (may need adjustment for longer tails); trim_to_first_all_one is essential but buggy when using temp grids for 7-as-1 detection without proper alignment, leading to length mismatches; no extraction of "objects" like blobs was attempted, but it might be useful for identifying disconnected filled regions if the puzzle involves that (not evident yet).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output has 8 rows and 10 columns, with a patterned structure of alternating 1s and 4s in upper rows (e.g., rows 1-3: [4,1,4,1,4,1,4,...] repeating), transitioning to solid 1s in lower rows (e.g., rows 4-7 mostly 1s with some 4s on left); this looks somewhat plausible for a puzzle reduction but does not appear fully correct, as it retains a full 10-column width without trimming (no evident all-1 column to cut at), and the top row is all 4s while lower parts have unbroken 1-runs that might need block removal if they were 7-mixed originally.
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Likely over-retains width (expected might trim after column 6-8 where 1-runs start), and patterns like the diagonal-ish 1s in upper rows may not have been cleaned properly around implicit 7s; bottom rows have consistent [1,4,1,4,1,1,1,...] but expected could have more 4s if 7-tails were cleaned; it mismatches subtlety by not reducing vertical filled blocks (e.g., columns 4-6 are mostly 1s in lower half, potentially a removable block if >=3).
 * The output makes partial sense (alternating patterns suggest preserved puzzle clues) but not fully correct, as it ignores potential column-wise filled blocks and trimming, leading to an unreduced grid; account for test cases with vertical 7s or longer 1-tails requiring extended cleaning.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 04:31:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 2D array of integers (primarily 1s for empty/unfilled cells, 4s for cleared or processed cells, and 7s for special filled blocks that need processing), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to simplify the grid by removing redundant filled structures, propagating clears in specific patterns (downward ends, inner fills, conditional upward), removing qualifying bottom rows, and conditionally padding the right side with elements from the original grid to produce a cleaned, rule-compliant output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent puzzle states where 1s are open/empty, 7s indicate solid blocks to be cleared to 4s (with up to 2 following 1s also cleared), and 4s are processed/cleared states; entire rows or columns of 1s/7s are considered "all-filled" for removal rules.
 * Remove blocks of 3+ consecutive all-filled rows (1s or 7s), but preserve smaller blocks or non-filled rows; this is iterative and applies before column processing.
 * For columns (processed via transpose), cut off the tail (everything to the right) after the first block of 1+ consecutive all-filled columns; this is not symmetric to rows and only triggers once per iteration.
 * Simplification (removing row/column blocks) is iterative until the grid dimensions stabilize, ensuring no further changes.
 * After simplification, identify and clear 7-blocks horizontally: replace consecutive 7s with 4s, and optionally the next 1-2 1s; collect these as (row, start_col, end_col) tuples for propagation.
 * Propagation rules are directional and conditional: from each cleared block, set ends (first and last columns) to 4 if they are 1s, downward for exactly 2 levels; if block width >=4, also set inner columns (excluding ends) to 4 at level 3 downward; if the block is in the bottom row and width >=2, propagate upward 1 level to the ends only.
 * After propagation, iteratively remove bottom rows where number of 4s > number of 1s (but the row is not entirely 4s); count the number of such removed rows (M) for later padding.
 * If M > 0, pad the right side of the remaining grid with M+1 columns: default to 4s, but copy from the original grid's corresponding rows (shifted down by M) starting from column (original_width - (M+1)), clamping to bounds and filling short with 4s; this preserves original content where possible.
 * Edge cases: empty grids return empty; transposes handle empty/uneven grids; propagation skips invalid indices; removal stops if no qualifying rows; padding only if M>0 and applies uniformly to all remaining rows.
 * Subtleties: Propagation is asymmetric (down > up, ends > inners, level-specific); column cutting is "first block only" and removes everything after, potentially aggressive; bottom row removal excludes all-4s rows to avoid over-removal; padding uses original grid, so changes aren't permanent; all operations modify in-place where possible but return copies for safety.
 * Iterations in simplify_blocks prevent infinite loops but may over-simplify if row/column interactions cascade; cleaning assumes 7s are horizontal blocks only, no vertical 7-handling.
 * Potential misses: No handling for isolated 7s or non-consecutive patterns; propagation doesn't affect existing 4s or 7s (only sets 1s to 4s); no diagonal or full-grid fills; assumes rectangular grid (all rows same length).

(Note: The `simplify_blocks`, `remove_filled_column_blocks_cut_tail`, `remove_bottom_rows`, and main `program` functions are also helpful as they orchestrate the process, but the above are core utilities for extraction and propagation. The `remove_filled_column_blocks_cut_tail` function is somewhat helpful for tail-cutting but is asymmetric and may over-remove in some cases—use cautiously.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it successfully handled all 4 training examples correctly, indicating strong alignment with core rules like block removal, propagation, and bottom-row trimming for standard cases.
 * The attempt correctly implements iterative simplification, which prevents cascading errors in row/column processing.
 * However, the padding logic in `program` (copying from original shifted rows) worked for training but may introduce artifacts if the original grid has unexpected content outside simplified bounds.
 * No prior misses noted for training, but subtle propagation (e.g., inner level 3 only for width >=4) was crucial and correctly captured.
 * The `clean_and_collect_blocks` function is essential for identifying propagatable segments and modifies the grid in-place effectively.
 * Function `remove_filled_column_blocks_cut_tail` is helpful but potentially over-aggressive (cuts entire tail after first qualifying block), which might explain discrepancies if test input has multiple column blocks; it's relevant but needs tuning for cases with spaced fills.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are tied to rules, though `is_all_filled` assumes 1/7 only (may miss other values like 4s in filled checks).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows an 8-row grid (reduced from likely more in input) with a top row of all 4s, followed by 3 identical rows of patterned 4s and 1s (alternating with some trailing 4s/1s), then 3 rows of similar but shifted 1/4 patterns, and a bottom row with more 1s clustered right.
 * This does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: the top all-4s row suggests over-removal or padding artifacts (possibly from simplify_blocks treating it as non-qualifying), and the repeating row patterns (e.g., [4,1,4,1,4,1,4,4,4,1] x3) imply incomplete propagation—downward end-fills should have cleared more 1s to 4s in lower rows if 7-blocks were present above, but clusters of 1s remain uncleared (e.g., bottom-right 1s not propagated inner if width >=4). The bottom row [1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1] has num4=3 > num1=7? Wait, 3<7 so shouldn't be removed, but if M>0 from prior removals, right-padding with 4s or original might explain extra width (10 cols), yet it doesn't match expected cleaner structure (e.g., more symmetric clears or no trailing 1-clusters if propagation applied fully).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should have more consolidated 4s downward (e.g., ends filled levels 1-2, inners at 3), no redundant repeating rows unless input had them post-simplification, and padding only if bottom rows removed—here, the output seems to retain too many 1s in bottoms (suggesting remove_bottom_rows didn't trigger enough or propagation missed width conditions), and the all-4s top row might be an unintended preserve from small block (<3). It's different in having asymmetric 1-clusters rightward, which could be from tail-cut not applying or padding pulling uncleared original 1s; unknown why repeating rows weren't further simplified/propagated, but it appears the column-cut or iteration stabilized prematurely.
