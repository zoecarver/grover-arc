=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 07:14:36] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 07:24:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

[2025-10-03 07:24:19] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def fill_zeros_with_orange(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill all empty cells (0) with orange (5), based on observation that empty spaces are filled in outputs."""
    h = copy_grid(g)
    for i in range(len(h)):
        h[i] = [5 if cell == 0 else cell for cell in h[i]]
    return h

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Compose transformations: copy and fill zeros with orange."""

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 07:36:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where numbers represent colors or object types (e.g., 1,2,3,5 for different elements, 8/7/9/4 likely for borders or backgrounds), and zeros indicate empty spaces that may or may not need filling based on rules. The goal appears to be transforming the input grid by applying color mappings, completing shapes, or filling specific regions while preserving empties in certain areas, rather than a uniform fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Zeros (empty spaces) are not always filled; in expected outputs, some remain 0 (e.g., scattered empties inside shapes in training example 1), suggesting selective filling based on proximity to objects, containment, or pattern completion—uniform filling with 5 (orange) overwrites these and fails.
 * Existing numbers sometimes change values (e.g., in training example 1, bottom-right 2,2 pairs become 3,3 in expected, while top 2,2 stay 2,2; in example 2, some 7's become 3's and 4's become 5's), indicating rule-based recoloring, possibly mapping colors by object type, size, or position (e.g., symmetric or mirrored changes).
 * Background/border values (8 in ex1, 9 in ex2, 7 in ex3, 4 in test) remain unchanged, but inner regions show pattern extensions or fills (e.g., in ex1, new 3,3 blocks appear where input might have had partials or empties; in ex3, 1,1 and 6,6 extend into 5's or 3's).
 * Shapes seem to be "objects" like blobs or lines (e.g., pairs of 1's, 2's, 6's), which may need extraction for analysis—rules could involve counting connected components, filling enclosed areas, or applying color swaps based on global patterns (e.g., orange 5 fills some but not all voids).
 * Subtle: Outputs maintain grid structure but alter internals; empties near borders or outside shapes stay 0, while those inside get filled (but not always with 5—e.g., ex1 has 0's inside what looks like a frame). Possible symmetry or mirroring (e.g., ex1 has mirrored 1,1 and 2,2 placements). Avoid over-filling, as it breaks expected 0 preservation. Consider object adjacency or flooding from seeds.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): No object extraction, so misses identifying regions; uniform fill ignores why some 0's stay (e.g., non-contiguous empties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid without modification—useful as a base for safe transformations."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Extract positions of connected regions (e.g., blobs of same number) using flood-fill; helpful for identifying objects to recolor or fill around.
    Assumes 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right). Returns list of (i,j) positions."""
    if g[start_i][start_j] != target_val:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    component = []
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == target_val:
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```

(Note: No other functions from the attempt are helpful; `fill_zeros_with_orange` is broken as it uniformly fills all 0's, ignoring selective rules, and should not be reused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly copies the grid and fills all 0's with 5 (orange), which works for preserving non-zero values and borders but fails entirely on selective filling—e.g., in train1, it turns expected internal 0's (like row2 col7=0) into 5's, but expected keeps them 0; also mismatches recoloring (e.g., row14 col10-11=2,2 becomes 3,3 in expected, but attempt leaves as 2,2).
 * In train1, generated has extra 5's in places like row3 col6=5 (expected 0), and bottom 2,2 unchanged where expected has 3,3—difference unknown but likely due to missing color mapping for specific object types (e.g., bottom blobs are a different "color" class).
 * In train2, generated leaves some values like 7's and 4's unchanged (e.g., row1 col7-8=7,7 becomes 3,3 in expected), filling 0's with 5's incorrectly (e.g., row1 col6=5 in expected but was 0? Wait, input not shown, but output shows mismatches like row0 col6=4 in generated vs 5 in expected)—indicates no recoloring logic.
 * In train3, generated keeps 1's as 1's and 6's as 6's (e.g., row1 col2-3=1,1 unchanged, but expected has 3,3), and fills 0's with 5's where expected extends patterns differently (e.g., row2 col10-13=6,6,6,6 becomes 5,5,5,5)—suggests missing blob extension or type-based filling.
 * No extraction of objects, so can't identify why some regions (e.g., enclosed 0's) get filled vs. others stay empty; uniform approach misses all subtleties like color swaps (2->3, 1->3? patterns).
 * `fill_zeros_with_orange` is unhelpful/broken: it over-fills and ignores recoloring, leading to all training failures; do not reuse without conditions (e.g., only fill if adjacent to certain objects).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of the input with 0's filled as 5's (e.g., row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where likely 0's were), but preserves input numbers like 9's,1's, and a single 5, while borders are 4's unchanged. This mismatches the pattern from training, where outputs involve recoloring (e.g., no 2->3-like changes here, and scattered 0's should likely remain in non-shape areas like inside the 9/1 frames). It looks incorrect because it doesn't complete or alter shapes (e.g., the 1,1 pairs and 9 blocks seem unextended, unlike train1's 3,3 additions); instead, it's just a lazy fill, ignoring why train examples needed specific changes. To fix, need rules for object detection (e.g., treat 1's as one type to extend/fill around) and handle larger grid (30 cols) with possible symmetry in the 9/1/5 regions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 07:36:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where numbers represent colors or object types (e.g., 1,2,3,5 for different elements, 8/7/9/4 likely for borders or backgrounds), and zeros indicate empty spaces that may or may not need filling based on rules. The goal appears to be transforming the input grid by applying color mappings, completing shapes, or filling specific regions while preserving empties in certain areas, rather than a uniform fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Zeros (empty spaces) are not always filled; in expected outputs, some remain 0 (e.g., scattered empties inside shapes in training example 1), suggesting selective filling based on proximity to objects, containment, or pattern completion—uniform filling with 5 (orange) overwrites these and fails.
 * Existing numbers sometimes change values (e.g., in training example 1, bottom-right 2,2 pairs become 3,3 in expected, while top 2,2 stay 2,2; in example 2, some 7's become 3's and 4's become 5's), indicating rule-based recoloring, possibly mapping colors by object type, size, or position (e.g., symmetric or mirrored changes).
 * Background/border values (8 in ex1, 9 in ex2, 7 in ex3, 4 in test) remain unchanged, but inner regions show pattern extensions or fills (e.g., in ex1, new 3,3 blocks appear where input might have had partials or empties; in ex3, 1,1 and 6,6 extend into 5's or 3's).
 * Shapes seem to be "objects" like blobs or lines (e.g., pairs of 1's, 2's, 6's), which may need extraction for analysis—rules could involve counting connected components, filling enclosed areas, or applying color swaps based on global patterns (e.g., orange 5 fills some but not all voids).
 * Subtle: Outputs maintain grid structure but alter internals; empties near borders or outside shapes stay 0, while those inside get filled (but not always with 5—e.g., ex1 has 0's inside what looks like a frame). Possible symmetry or mirroring (e.g., ex1 has mirrored 1,1 and 2,2 placements). Avoid over-filling, as it breaks expected 0 preservation. Consider object adjacency or flooding from seeds.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): No object extraction, so misses identifying regions; uniform fill ignores why some 0's stay (e.g., non-contiguous empties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid without modification—useful as a base for safe transformations."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Extract positions of connected regions (e.g., blobs of same number) using flood-fill; helpful for identifying objects to recolor or fill around.
    Assumes 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right). Returns list of (i,j) positions."""
    if g[start_i][start_j] != target_val:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    component = []
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == target_val:
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```

(Note: No other functions from the attempt are helpful; `fill_zeros_with_orange` is broken as it uniformly fills all 0's, ignoring selective rules, and should not be reused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly copies the grid and fills all 0's with 5 (orange), which works for preserving non-zero values and borders but fails entirely on selective filling—e.g., in train1, it turns expected internal 0's (like row2 col7=0) into 5's, but expected keeps them 0; also mismatches recoloring (e.g., row14 col10-11=2,2 becomes 3,3 in expected, but attempt leaves as 2,2).
 * In train1, generated has extra 5's in places like row3 col6=5 (expected 0), and bottom 2,2 unchanged where expected has 3,3—difference unknown but likely due to missing color mapping for specific object types (e.g., bottom blobs are a different "color" class).
 * In train2, generated leaves some values like 7's and 4's unchanged (e.g., row1 col7-8=7,7 becomes 3,3 in expected), filling 0's with 5's incorrectly (e.g., row1 col6=5 in expected but was 0? Wait, input not shown, but output shows mismatches like row0 col6=4 in generated vs 5 in expected)—indicates no recoloring logic.
 * In train3, generated keeps 1's as 1's and 6's as 6's (e.g., row1 col2-3=1,1 unchanged, but expected has 3,3), and fills 0's with 5's where expected extends patterns differently (e.g., row2 col10-13=6,6,6,6 becomes 5,5,5,5)—suggests missing blob extension or type-based filling.
 * No extraction of objects, so can't identify why some regions (e.g., enclosed 0's) get filled vs. others stay empty; uniform approach misses all subtleties like color swaps (2->3, 1->3? patterns).
 * `fill_zeros_with_orange` is unhelpful/broken: it over-fills and ignores recoloring, leading to all training failures; do not reuse without conditions (e.g., only fill if adjacent to certain objects).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of the input with 0's filled as 5's (e.g., row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where likely 0's were), but preserves input numbers like 9's,1's, and a single 5, while borders are 4's unchanged. This mismatches the pattern from training, where outputs involve recoloring (e.g., no 2->3-like changes here, and scattered 0's should likely remain in non-shape areas like inside the 9/1 frames). It looks incorrect because it doesn't complete or alter shapes (e.g., the 1,1 pairs and 9 blocks seem unextended, unlike train1's 3,3 additions); instead, it's just a lazy fill, ignoring why train examples needed specific changes. To fix, need rules for object detection (e.g., treat 1's as one type to extend/fill around) and handle larger grid (30 cols) with possible symmetry in the 9/1/5 regions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 07:48:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 07:48:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where numbers represent colors or object types (e.g., 1,2,3,5 for different elements, 8/7/9/4 likely for borders or backgrounds), and zeros indicate empty spaces that may or may not need filling based on rules. The goal appears to be transforming the input grid by applying color mappings, completing shapes, or filling specific regions while preserving empties in certain areas, rather than a uniform fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Zeros (empty spaces) are not always filled; in expected outputs, some remain 0 (e.g., scattered empties inside shapes in training example 1), suggesting selective filling based on proximity to objects, containment, or pattern completion—uniform filling with 5 (orange) overwrites these and fails.
 * Existing numbers sometimes change values (e.g., in training example 1, bottom-right 2,2 pairs become 3,3 in expected, while top 2,2 stay 2,2; in example 2, some 7's become 3's and 4's become 5's), indicating rule-based recoloring, possibly mapping colors by object type, size, or position (e.g., symmetric or mirrored changes).
 * Background/border values (8 in ex1, 9 in ex2, 7 in ex3, 4 in test) remain unchanged, but inner regions show pattern extensions or fills (e.g., in ex1, new 3,3 blocks appear where input might have had partials or empties; in ex3, 1,1 and 6,6 extend into 5's or 3's).
 * Shapes seem to be "objects" like blobs or lines (e.g., pairs of 1's, 2's, 6's), which may need extraction for analysis—rules could involve counting connected components, filling enclosed areas, or applying color swaps based on global patterns (e.g., orange 5 fills some but not all voids).
 * Subtle: Outputs maintain grid structure but alter internals; empties near borders or outside shapes stay 0, while those inside get filled (but not always with 5—e.g., ex1 has 0's inside what looks like a frame). Possible symmetry or mirroring (e.g., ex1 has mirrored 1,1 and 2,2 placements). Avoid over-filling, as it breaks expected 0 preservation. Consider object adjacency or flooding from seeds.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): No object extraction, so misses identifying regions; uniform fill ignores why some 0's stay (e.g., non-contiguous empties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid without modification—useful as a base for safe transformations."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Extract positions of connected regions (e.g., blobs of same number) using flood-fill; helpful for identifying objects to recolor or fill around.
    Assumes 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right). Returns list of (i,j) positions."""
    if g[start_i][start_j] != target_val:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    component = []
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == target_val:
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```

(Note: No other functions from the attempt are helpful; `fill_zeros_with_orange` is broken as it uniformly fills all 0's, ignoring selective rules, and should not be reused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly copies the grid and fills all 0's with 5 (orange), which works for preserving non-zero values and borders but fails entirely on selective filling—e.g., in train1, it turns expected internal 0's (like row2 col7=0) into 5's, but expected keeps them 0; also mismatches recoloring (e.g., row14 col10-11=2,2 becomes 3,3 in expected, but attempt leaves as 2,2).
 * In train1, generated has extra 5's in places like row3 col6=5 (expected 0), and bottom 2,2 unchanged where expected has 3,3—difference unknown but likely due to missing color mapping for specific object types (e.g., bottom blobs are a different "color" class).
 * In train2, generated leaves some values like 7's and 4's unchanged (e.g., row1 col7-8=7,7 becomes 3,3 in expected), filling 0's with 5's incorrectly (e.g., row1 col6=5 in expected but was 0? Wait, input not shown, but output shows mismatches like row0 col6=4 in generated vs 5 in expected)—indicates no recoloring logic.
 * In train3, generated keeps 1's as 1's and 6's as 6's (e.g., row1 col2-3=1,1 unchanged, but expected has 3,3), and fills 0's with 5's where expected extends patterns differently (e.g., row2 col10-13=6,6,6,6 becomes 5,5,5,5)—suggests missing blob extension or type-based filling.
 * No extraction of objects, so can't identify why some regions (e.g., enclosed 0's) get filled vs. others stay empty; uniform approach misses all subtleties like color swaps (2->3, 1->3? patterns).
 * `fill_zeros_with_orange` is unhelpful/broken: it over-fills and ignores recoloring, leading to all training failures; do not reuse without conditions (e.g., only fill if adjacent to certain objects).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of the input with 0's filled as 5's (e.g., row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where likely 0's were), but preserves input numbers like 9's,1's, and a single 5, while borders are 4's unchanged. This mismatches the pattern from training, where outputs involve recoloring (e.g., no 2->3-like changes here, and scattered 0's should likely remain in non-shape areas like inside the 9/1 frames). It looks incorrect because it doesn't complete or alter shapes (e.g., the 1,1 pairs and 9 blocks seem unextended, unlike train1's 3,3 additions); instead, it's just a lazy fill, ignoring why train examples needed specific changes. To fix, need rules for object detection (e.g., treat 1's as one type to extend/fill around) and handle larger grid (30 cols) with possible symmetry in the 9/1/5 regions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:02:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

(This is helpful for identifying 8-connected blobs of a specific color, excluding bg.)

                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False
```
(These are helpful for edge visibility checks, but has_right_visible may need fixing to not special-case 1.)

```python
def touches_bottom(component: List[Tuple[int, int]], n: int, g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    m = len(g[0])

            return True
    return False
```
(These are helpful for special case edge-touching, using adjacency to bg.)

                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0:
                        out[ni][nj] = 5
                        queue.append((ni, nj))
    # Propagate
    while queue:

            nj = j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0:
                out[ni][nj] = 5
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 08:02:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where numbers represent colors or object types (e.g., 1,2,3,5 for different elements, 8/7/9/4 likely for borders or backgrounds), and zeros indicate empty spaces that may or may not need filling based on rules. The goal appears to be transforming the input grid by applying color mappings, completing shapes, or filling specific regions while preserving empties in certain areas, rather than a uniform fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Zeros (empty spaces) are not always filled; in expected outputs, some remain 0 (e.g., scattered empties inside shapes in training example 1), suggesting selective filling based on proximity to objects, containment, or pattern completion—uniform filling with 5 (orange) overwrites these and fails.
 * Existing numbers sometimes change values (e.g., in training example 1, bottom-right 2,2 pairs become 3,3 in expected, while top 2,2 stay 2,2; in example 2, some 7's become 3's and 4's become 5's), indicating rule-based recoloring, possibly mapping colors by object type, size, or position (e.g., symmetric or mirrored changes).
 * Background/border values (8 in ex1, 9 in ex2, 7 in ex3, 4 in test) remain unchanged, but inner regions show pattern extensions or fills (e.g., in ex1, new 3,3 blocks appear where input might have had partials or empties; in ex3, 1,1 and 6,6 extend into 5's or 3's).
 * Shapes seem to be "objects" like blobs or lines (e.g., pairs of 1's, 2's, 6's), which may need extraction for analysis—rules could involve counting connected components, filling enclosed areas, or applying color swaps based on global patterns (e.g., orange 5 fills some but not all voids).
 * Subtle: Outputs maintain grid structure but alter internals; empties near borders or outside shapes stay 0, while those inside get filled (but not always with 5—e.g., ex1 has 0's inside what looks like a frame). Possible symmetry or mirroring (e.g., ex1 has mirrored 1,1 and 2,2 placements). Avoid over-filling, as it breaks expected 0 preservation. Consider object adjacency or flooding from seeds.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): No object extraction, so misses identifying regions; uniform fill ignores why some 0's stay (e.g., non-contiguous empties).

        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == target_val:

    return component
```

(Note: No other functions from the attempt are helpful; `fill_zeros_with_orange` is broken as it uniformly fills all 0's, ignoring selective rules, and should not be reused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly copies the grid and fills all 0's with 5 (orange), which works for preserving non-zero values and borders but fails entirely on selective filling—e.g., in train1, it turns expected internal 0's (like row2 col7=0) into 5's, but expected keeps them 0; also mismatches recoloring (e.g., row14 col10-11=2,2 becomes 3,3 in expected, but attempt leaves as 2,2).
 * In train1, generated has extra 5's in places like row3 col6=5 (expected 0), and bottom 2,2 unchanged where expected has 3,3—difference unknown but likely due to missing color mapping for specific object types (e.g., bottom blobs are a different "color" class).
 * In train2, generated leaves some values like 7's and 4's unchanged (e.g., row1 col7-8=7,7 becomes 3,3 in expected), filling 0's with 5's incorrectly (e.g., row1 col6=5 in expected but was 0? Wait, input not shown, but output shows mismatches like row0 col6=4 in generated vs 5 in expected)—indicates no recoloring logic.
 * In train3, generated keeps 1's as 1's and 6's as 6's (e.g., row1 col2-3=1,1 unchanged, but expected has 3,3), and fills 0's with 5's where expected extends patterns differently (e.g., row2 col10-13=6,6,6,6 becomes 5,5,5,5)—suggests missing blob extension or type-based filling.
 * No extraction of objects, so can't identify why some regions (e.g., enclosed 0's) get filled vs. others stay empty; uniform approach misses all subtleties like color swaps (2->3, 1->3? patterns).
 * `fill_zeros_with_orange` is unhelpful/broken: it over-fills and ignores recoloring, leading to all training failures; do not reuse without conditions (e.g., only fill if adjacent to certain objects).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of the input with 0's filled as 5's (e.g., row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where likely 0's were), but preserves input numbers like 9's,1's, and a single 5, while borders are 4's unchanged. This mismatches the pattern from training, where outputs involve recoloring (e.g., no 2->3-like changes here, and scattered 0's should likely remain in non-shape areas like inside the 9/1 frames). It looks incorrect because it doesn't complete or alter shapes (e.g., the 1,1 pairs and 9 blocks seem unextended, unlike train1's 3,3 additions); instead, it's just a lazy fill, ignoring why train examples needed specific changes. To fix, need rules for object detection (e.g., treat 1's as one type to extend/fill around) and handle larger grid (30 cols) with possible symmetry in the 9/1/5 regions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

                break
        if visible:

```
(These are helpful for edge visibility checks, but has_right_visible may need fixing to not special-case 1.)

(These are helpful for special case edge-touching, using adjacency to bg.)

                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0:
                        out[ni][nj] = 5
                        queue.append((ni, nj))
    # Propagate
    while queue:
        i, j = queue.popleft()

            ni = i + di
            nj = j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0:
                out[ni][nj] = 5
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:17:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where cells with numeric values (0-9) represent colors, empty space (0), or background, and the task is to identify connected components (likely 8-connected, including diagonals) of specific "object" colors, evaluate their visibility or positioning relative to borders (e.g., top, left, bottom), repaint them with target colors (often 3 or 5), perform flood fills on empty (0) areas from certain seeds or borders to distinguish enclosed vs. open spaces, and handle special cases based on the background color (e.g., bg=8 triggers unique rules). The output transforms the input grid into a segmented or labeled version, preserving background and non-objects while marking "visible" or "enclosed" regions appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), not just 4-connected, as the extraction uses all 8 directions; this is crucial for identifying blob-like objects that touch diagonally.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and it varies across examples (8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3); rules must adapt to bg, e.g., non-bg cells !=0 are potential objects, but 0 is empty/space to fill or flood.
 * Visibility checks: "Top visible" means at least one cell in the component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; "left visible" similarly checks left in the same row. These determine if an object is "exposed" from edges, triggering repaints (e.g., greens to 3 if top-visible, oranges to 5 if top- or left-visible).
 * Special case for bg=8: Only components of color 2 that "touch bottom" (any cell with row >= n-3) get painted to 3; this seems like a "grounded" or "falling" object rule, but the threshold (n-3) may be too loose or arbitrary.
 * Flood filling: Two types—(1) flood_from_seeds starts from cells with values in {1,3,5} and spreads to adjacent 0's (8 directions) with 5, but only marks visited 0's without fully propagating from new 5's in the queue (potential bug: it sets to 5 but queue only adds direct neighbors, not chaining fully? Wait, it does chain via while loop); (2) fill_enclosed_zeros floods from all border 0's (top/bottom/left/right edges) using BFS on 0's (8 directions), marks open/connected-to-border 0's as visited, then paints remaining (enclosed) 0's to 5. This distinguishes holes/ enclosed spaces from outer space.
 * Color groups: "Greens" [1,7,9] painted to 3 if top-visible (perhaps "sky" or "falling from top" objects); "oranges" [4,6] to 5 if top- or left-visible (side-exposed). But in train2 (bg=9), 9 is treated as green but is actually bg in expected, causing overpainting. 2's handled specially only for bg=8.
 * Subtleties: Do not paint bg itself (e.g., in train2, 9 stays 9); 0's on borders are "open" and stay 0 if not enclosed, but enclosed 0's become 5. Components must ignore bg and 0 in connectivity. Bottom-touch in bg=8 uses a fixed offset (n-3), which might miss if grid size varies or "bottom" means stricter (e.g., i == n-1). Flood seeds {1,3,5} suggest painting after initial repaints to propagate "influence." Diagonal connectivity can merge objects unexpectedly. In train1, some 0's stay 0 in expected (open spaces), but generated fills them wrongly. No handling for other colors (e.g., 5 in input?).
 * Easy-to-miss: After repainting components, re-run floods on the updated grid (out), as new 3/5 can seed further fills. But in code, flood_from_seeds runs before fill_enclosed_zeros, which uses original g for flooding (bug: should use out?). Visited in floods must reset per call. For bg!=8, no bottom-touch logic, but train3 suggests similar positioning rules for other colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it fails all training examples due to incorrect color grouping and overpainting (e.g., treats input 9 as "green" object in train2, but 9 is bg and should stay unchanged).
 * For train1 (bg=8): Generated correctly paints some bottom 2's to 3 (e.g., row14 col4-5, row15 col4-5 match expected), and some 5's on right (e.g., row3 col16-17), but wrongly paints extra 3's (row13 col10-11 as 3,3 but expected 3,3? Wait, row13 expected has 3,3 at col10-11? No—generated has 3,3 there but expected has them lower; actually, generated fills too many 0's to 5 (e.g., row3 col14=5 but expected=0; row6 col2=5 but expected=0; row8 col2=5 but expected=8? No, row8 col3=5 expected 0), leaving open 0's filled instead of staying 0. Bottom 2's in row8-9 col12-13 stay 2 in generated but expected painted? Unknown why—perhaps touches_bottom misses them (i=7,8 < n-3=15? n=18, n-3=15, so i=7<15 misses). Flood overfills enclosed/open distinction.
 * For train2 (bg=9): Generated paints almost entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., top row all 3's but expected mostly 9's with some 5/3), treating bg=9 as object and flooding everything; no preservation of bg or correct components (e.g., expected keeps 9's as bg, paints specific 3/4/6/7 areas differently). Color groups wrong—9 should not be in "greens."
 * For train3 (bg=7? Expected shows 7 as bg): Generated uses 3 as pseudo-bg? (all borders 3, but paints inner to 5/3), but expected uses 7 as bg and selectively paints (e.g., row1 col2-3=3,3 expected but generated row1 all 3's; row4 col2=5 expected but generated=3; bottom row17-18=2,2 expected but generated all 3's). Overpaints bg and ignores correct visibility (e.g., some 1/6 components not painted right). Component extraction likely merges wrongly due to wrong target_vals.
 * extract_components is essential and seems correct (8-connected BFS works for blobs).
 * touches_bottom is partially helpful but broken for non-strict bottom (n-3 too loose, misses mid-bottom objects in train1).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is unhelpful/broken: Overfloods 0's to 5 without respecting enclosure (e.g., fills open spaces in train1 that should stay 0); seeds {1,3,5} too broad post-repaint.
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is helpful but misused: Called on original g after floods, but should integrate better (e.g., flood on updated out); in train1, it leaves some enclosed 0's unfilled wrongly.
 * Overall: No adaptation for varying bg (hardcodes greens/oranges assuming bg!= those); program ignores input colors like 5/7 properly in non-8 cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It floods massive border areas to 5 (e.g., entire top/bottom/left/right rows/columns are 5's, suggesting bg=5? But input not provided—assuming bg !=5, this overpaints bg/objects). Inner structures show partial logic (e.g., horizontal 3's in rows 2-3 cols2-22 look like a top-visible "green" bar painted to 3; vertical 4's in cols13-21 rows4-25 seem like orange components painted/kept? But mixed with 1's and 9's that should perhaps be repainted). However, large 5-flooded regions (e.g., rows 0-1 all 5's, right cols22-29 all 5's) likely wrongly fill open space instead of preserving 0's or bg; enclosed areas (e.g., potential holes in the 4/1/9 structures) may not be filled to 5 correctly, as some 1/9 persist inside. 9's appear in lower middle (rows12-15 cols13-15,21-23), suggesting unreached "greens" but if bg!=9, this mismatches. Without input, hard to confirm, but it doesn't match expected patterns from trains (e.g., should have more 0's for open space, selective 3/5 only on visible components); looks like overflooding similar to train failures, missing enclosure distinction and bg preservation. To handle test, need better bg-adaptive color groups (e.g., exclude bg from objects) and stricter visibility/flood rules.

[2025-10-03 08:17:36] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of interconnected properties and components that show obvious, consistent interactions or effects across **all three train examples**. Only elements with interactions present in *every* puzzle are included (e.g., no additions of new components, as this only occurs in Train 1). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated blocks with no transformation, or changes unique to one example) are excluded. Interactions are limited to those that can be directly inferred from properties like color, position (bbox), holes, and pixels. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained (e.g., exact rule for color choice), it is called out as unknown.

1. **Large holed component (holes > 0) ↔ Small components (holes = 0)**:
   - The large component (e.g., Maroon holes=8 in Train 1, Light Blue holes=4 in Train 2, Dark Red holes=1 in Train 3) remains completely unchanged (same color, bbox, holes, pixels) in input vs. output across all examples.
   - Interaction: Serves as a fixed frame or container for small components. Small components (holes=0) are positioned within or adjacent to its bbox, and their proximity or relative position to this large component's bbox triggers color transformations in the small components (while preserving their own bbox, holes=0, and pixels). The large component itself is unaffected, indicating a one-way effect where it defines boundaries for transformations.
   - Consistent across all: No changes to the large component's properties; it "governs" transformations in enclosed/adjacent small components.

2. **Position (bbox of small components, holes=0) → Color transformation**:
   - Small components (holes=0, typically pixels=1–4, 1x1 or small blocks) have their bbox unchanged in output, but color transforms (e.g., Red → Green in Train 1, Dark Red → Green in Train 2, Blue → Green in Train 3; Yellow → Orange in Train 2, Pink → Orange in Train 3).
   - Interaction: The bbox coordinates (especially y-range, indicating vertical position relative to the large holed component) directly affect whether a small component's color changes and to what (Green or Orange). Not all small components transform (some stay the same color, e.g., internal or mid-position blocks), but transformations only occur in existing small components—no resizing or relocation.
   - Consistent across all: Position-based color change is the primary transformation mechanism for small components; exact rule for "which" positions map to Green vs. Orange vs. no change is unknown (e.g., peripheral vs. central positions may play a role, but cannot be pinpointed without further data).
   - No effect on holes or pixels: These remain 0 and unchanged for small components.

3. **Background color (solid) → Overall composition**:
   - Input: Solid magenta background across all examples.
   - Output: Solid yellow background across all examples.
   - Interaction: The background color transformation affects the visibility or contrast of all components (large holed structure and small blocks) by altering the canvas color scheme. It interacts with the unchanged large holed component and transformed small components to shift the entire visual composition from an "open" (input) to "enclosed/frame-like" (output) style, without altering individual component properties.
   - Consistent across all: Uniform color shift from magenta to yellow, superseding local component changes.

4. **Holes property → Stability of component**:
   - Components with holes > 0 (always the large one) remain fully stable (no color, bbox, or pixel changes).
   - Components with holes = 0 (small blocks) are subject to position-driven color changes.
   - Interaction: Hole count determines vulnerability to transformation—holes > 0 "protects" the component from any effects (possibly indicating a filled/closed silhouette that resists change), while holes = 0 allows position to trigger color shifts. This creates a hierarchical interaction where holed components anchor the non-holed ones.
   - Consistent across all: Hole count is preserved in output for every component; it consistently gates whether transformations occur (none for holed, possible for non-holed).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., pixel count → transformation, specific shape/silhouette → movement, or color → position shift) are observable across all examples, as they vary or are absent. Line structures (mentioned in the general description) do not show consistent changes in the provided data (e.g., no clear black-to-blue shift or loop formation in component lists). The exact rule for position-driven color mapping (e.g., why certain bboxes become Green vs. Orange) is unknown and cannot be inferred from the data alone.

[2025-10-03 08:18:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of interconnected properties and components that show obvious, consistent interactions or effects across **all three train examples**. Only elements with interactions present in *every* puzzle are included (e.g., no additions of new components, as this only occurs in Train 1). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated blocks with no transformation, or changes unique to one example) are excluded. Interactions are limited to those that can be directly inferred from properties like color, position (bbox), holes, and pixels. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained (e.g., exact rule for color choice), it is called out as unknown.

1. **Large holed component (holes > 0) ↔ Small components (holes = 0)**:
   - The large component (e.g., Maroon holes=8 in Train 1, Light Blue holes=4 in Train 2, Dark Red holes=1 in Train 3) remains completely unchanged (same color, bbox, holes, pixels) in input vs. output across all examples.
   - Interaction: Serves as a fixed frame or container for small components. Small components (holes=0) are positioned within or adjacent to its bbox, and their proximity or relative position to this large component's bbox triggers color transformations in the small components (while preserving their own bbox, holes=0, and pixels). The large component itself is unaffected, indicating a one-way effect where it defines boundaries for transformations.
   - Consistent across all: No changes to the large component's properties; it "governs" transformations in enclosed/adjacent small components.

2. **Position (bbox of small components, holes=0) → Color transformation**:
   - Small components (holes=0, typically pixels=1–4, 1x1 or small blocks) have their bbox unchanged in output, but color transforms (e.g., Red → Green in Train 1, Dark Red → Green in Train 2, Blue → Green in Train 3; Yellow → Orange in Train 2, Pink → Orange in Train 3).
   - Interaction: The bbox coordinates (especially y-range, indicating vertical position relative to the large holed component) directly affect whether a small component's color changes and to what (Green or Orange). Not all small components transform (some stay the same color, e.g., internal or mid-position blocks), but transformations only occur in existing small components—no resizing or relocation.
   - Consistent across all: Position-based color change is the primary transformation mechanism for small components; exact rule for "which" positions map to Green vs. Orange vs. no change is unknown (e.g., peripheral vs. central positions may play a role, but cannot be pinpointed without further data).
   - No effect on holes or pixels: These remain 0 and unchanged for small components.

3. **Background color (solid) → Overall composition**:
   - Input: Solid magenta background across all examples.
   - Output: Solid yellow background across all examples.
   - Interaction: The background color transformation affects the visibility or contrast of all components (large holed structure and small blocks) by altering the canvas color scheme. It interacts with the unchanged large holed component and transformed small components to shift the entire visual composition from an "open" (input) to "enclosed/frame-like" (output) style, without altering individual component properties.
   - Consistent across all: Uniform color shift from magenta to yellow, superseding local component changes.

4. **Holes property → Stability of component**:
   - Components with holes > 0 (always the large one) remain fully stable (no color, bbox, or pixel changes).
   - Components with holes = 0 (small blocks) are subject to position-driven color changes.
   - Interaction: Hole count determines vulnerability to transformation—holes > 0 "protects" the component from any effects (possibly indicating a filled/closed silhouette that resists change), while holes = 0 allows position to trigger color shifts. This creates a hierarchical interaction where holed components anchor the non-holed ones.
   - Consistent across all: Hole count is preserved in output for every component; it consistently gates whether transformations occur (none for holed, possible for non-holed).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., pixel count → transformation, specific shape/silhouette → movement, or color → position shift) are observable across all examples, as they vary or are absent. Line structures (mentioned in the general description) do not show consistent changes in the provided data (e.g., no clear black-to-blue shift or loop formation in component lists). The exact rule for position-driven color mapping (e.g., why certain bboxes become Green vs. Orange) is unknown and cannot be inferred from the data alone.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 08:27:36] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to transform a colored grid by identifying the background, detecting connected components (blobs or objects) of non-background colors, preserving large or key structures (including potential holes), and selectively modifying small components based on their position relative to the grid's center, while leaving holes (often color 0) intact and applying specific color changes (e.g., to green=3 or orange=5) for certain small blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is reliably the most frequent color in the flattened grid; do not change it (e.g., no observed shifts from magenta to yellow in examples).
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); use bounding boxes (bbox) and positions to determine size, location (e.g., midpoint relative to grid center at n/2, m/2), and whether they are "large" (e.g., threshold like >20 or half the max size) or small—large ones must stay unchanged, including any with holes.
 * Holes appear as color 0 within objects; they should remain 0 (not filled with 5 or other colors), as seen in expected outputs where 0's persist in interiors while surrounding colors may change.
 * Small components (size < threshold) change color based on position: top (mid_r < center_r) often to 3 (green), left/bottom to 5 (orange), but only for non-hole, non-large blobs—subtle rule may involve quadrant or relative positioning, and not all small blobs change (e.g., some stay original if right/bottom).
 * No changes to numbers or representations within objects; preserve shapes but recolor small isolated blobs.
 * Components with holes (e.g., enclosed 0's) are treated as single units—do not modify internals unless specified; large holed components are unchanged.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, test 30x30); rules must scale without hardcoding.
 * Subtle: Some small blobs in bottom-left quadrants change to 3 in train1 expected (not 5), suggesting position rules may prioritize vertical over horizontal or have exceptions for certain colors/origins.
 * All non-background colors are considered for components, but bg=8/9/7/4 in examples—exclude bg from component search.
 * Potential for multiple components of same color; track individually by bbox/position.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def identify_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color as the most frequent color in the grid."""
    if not g:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for all examples; use it to exclude bg from component detection.)

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], color: int, n: int, m: int) -> List[dict]:
    """Find all 4-connected components of the given color."""
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j]:
                positions = []
                minr = maxr = i
                minc = maxc = j
                size = 0
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x][y] or g[x][y] != color:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    positions.append((x, y))
                    size += 1
                    minr = min(minr, x)
                    maxr = max(maxr, x)
                    minc = min(minc, y)
                    maxc = max(maxc, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if size > 0:
                    components.append({
                        'color': color,
                        'positions': positions,
                        'size': size,
                        'bbox': (minr, maxr, minc, maxc)
                    })
    return components
```
(This is helpful and mostly correct; it accurately detects components, sizes, and bbox for positioning—essential for identifying small vs. large and locations. Use DFS/stack for efficiency on large grids like test 30x30.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3) and finds connected components via 4-connectivity, which works for blob detection.
 * change_small_components_based_on_position partially understands position-based recoloring (uses center and midpoints), but misapplies: fills holes (0) with 5 incorrectly (expected keeps 0's as holes); changes some small blobs to 3/5 but wrong ones (e.g., train1 generated swaps 5's and 0's in right-side holes, adds extra 5's where expected has 0's, and puts 3's only in bottom where expected has them but misses top/left specifics).
 * keep_large_holed_component_unchanged is a good idea but broken—does nothing useful, as it just copies grid; needs to explicitly detect/ preserve holed/large components (e.g., by checking enclosed 0's or size > threshold).
 * change_background_color is unhelpful and broken—does nothing but comments suggest irrelevant magenta-to-yellow change not seen in any examples (ignore/discard it).
 * program overall structure is helpful (bg -> components -> modify small -> output), but thresholds like size >20 or >= large/2 are arbitrary and fail: train1 large blob (e.g., the '8' shape) preserved but small holes filled wrong; train2 top blobs changed to 3/7 instead of expected 5/3/4 swaps; train3 left blobs partially preserved but small 3's/5's not recolored correctly (e.g., generated keeps some 3's as-is where expected changes to 5/2/6).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has 5's in hole positions (e.g., row3 col15=5 vs expected 0; row8 col11=0 missing); bottom blobs changed to 3's correctly in some spots but adds extra 5's; overall, too many changes to small/right components.
 * Train2 mismatches: top row1 has 3,7,7,3 vs expected 5,3,3,5 (wrong colors for small top/left blobs); row3 col13=3 vs expected 4; mid changes like row10 col4=5 vs expected 4 (fills wrong).
 * Train3 mismatches: row2 has 3's unchanged where expected changes some to 5; row4 col2=6 unchanged but expected 5; bottom row17/18 has 5's where expected 2's; misses hole preservation and position-specific changes (e.g., left small to 5, but generated keeps originals).
 * Function change_small_components_based_on_position is partially helpful for position logic but broken for holes/color rules (don't fill 0's; refine thresholds/conditions).
 * No attempt handles hole detection (e.g., count enclosed 0's in bbox); add to components dict for 'holes' to preserve large holed ones.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it arbitrarily changes small clusters of 1's, 3's, and 5's (e.g., top-mid 3's and 1's mostly preserved but some 1's in row5-8 changed to 4's? Wait, no—generated shows many original 1's/3's/5's intact but scatters 5's into positions like row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where input likely has different, and fills some apparent holes/spaces inconsistently.
 * It seems to apply position rules poorly: e.g., upper-left 3's/1's partially changed (row3-4 col2-5=3's kept, but row16-18 bottom 5's added where input has 5's already?); lower-right 1's/3's modified to 4's in scattered ways, but without clear quadrant logic—looks like over-changing small components without preserving shapes/holes (e.g., row22 col20-21=1,1 added/changed vs input).
 * Missing key: no evident hole preservation (if input has 0's, likely filled); changes don't align with train patterns (e.g., no consistent top-to-3 or left-to-5); overall, output looks like noisy recoloring rather than structured puzzle solution—probably wrong because it fails on similar position/size logic as trains.

[2025-10-03 08:28:55] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data for the three train examples, I analyzed the components (blobs defined by color, holes, bbox, and pixels) in inputs vs. outputs. Only interactions, connections, or effects that are **obvious, consistent across ALL three train examples**, and directly inferable from properties (e.g., position via bbox, color, size via pixels/holes, or potential adjacency via overlapping/nearby bboxes) are listed below. No high-level puzzle solving or forced explanations are included. Components or properties that do not appear in every example (e.g., new small Orange blobs added only in train 1) or lack consistent interaction (e.g., pixel count changes, which vary) are excluded. Transformations that cannot be explained via obvious property interactions are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Large Holed Component (Background-Like Canvas)**
   - **Description**: One primary large component per example with multiple holes (holes=8 in train 1, holes=4 in train 2, holes=1 in train 3), full-canvas bbox (e.g., [0,0,17,17] or similar spanning the grid), and high pixel count (195+). Color varies by example (Maroon in train 1, Light Blue in train 2, Dark Red in train 3).
   - **Properties**: holes count, bbox (full grid span), pixels (high, representing filled area with cutouts).
   - **Consistent Interaction/Effect**:
     - Remains completely unchanged (color, holes, bbox, pixels identical in input and output across all examples).
     - **Connection to small solid components**: All small solid components (see #3) have bboxes fully contained within or overlapping this large component's bbox in every example, suggesting positional embedding (e.g., placed in "holes" or on the canvas). This positional relationship consistently correlates with small component transformations (see #3), but the exact effect (e.g., which holes influence changes) is unknown—no direct change to the large component itself.
     - No interaction with medium solid components (#2) beyond shared bbox overlap, which is unchanged.
   - **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Notes**: Background color described as purple (input) to yellow (output), but data shows no color change here; possible representation mismatch, but no data-based interaction identifiable.

#### 2. **Medium Solid Components (Structural Outlines or Borders)**
   - **Description**: 1–2 medium-sized components per example with no holes (holes=0), moderate pixel count (32–86), and elongated bboxes suggesting lines/paths (e.g., Maroon [3,2,9,14] pixels=59 in train 1; Light Blue [0,3,12,14] pixels=74 and [5,1,13,6] pixels=32 in train 2; Dark Red [2,2,13,16] pixels=86 and [6,6,15,15] pixels=49 in train 3). Colors vary (Maroon, Light Blue, Dark Red).
   - **Properties**: holes=0, bbox (rectangular, often horizontal/vertical spans), pixels (moderate, indicating connected lines or fills).
   - **Consistent Interaction/Effect**:
     - Remains completely unchanged (color, bbox, pixels identical in input and output across all examples).
     - **Connection to small solid components**: Bboxes of these medium components consistently overlap or are adjacent (e.g., within 1–2 units in x/y) to several small solid components in every example, suggesting structural connection (e.g., small blocks as "nodes" on these "paths"). This adjacency correlates with color changes in some small components (see #3), but the specific effect (e.g., proximity distance threshold) is unknown.
     - **Connection to large holed component**: Bboxes are subsets of the large component's bbox, with no change induced; positional embedding is consistent but has no observable effect on transformation.
   - **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Notes**: Line segments described as black (input) to blue (output), but data shows varying colors with no consistent recoloring here.

#### 3. **Small Solid Components (Colored Blocks or Nodes)**
   - **Description**: Multiple small components per example with no holes (holes=0), low pixel count (1–6, typically 1x1 or thin 1-unit squares/lines), and compact bboxes (e.g., size 1x1 or 1x2). Colors vary (Red/Blue in train 1, Yellow/Dark Red/Pink/Light Blue in train 2, Pink/Blue/Red in train 3).
   - **Properties**: holes=0, bbox (small grid positions, often at edges like low y for "top" placement), pixels (low, indicating discrete blocks).
   - **Consistent Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Color transformation**: In every example, a subset of these components changes color to either Orange or Green in the output, while others remain unchanged. This is the only consistent transformation observed. No size, holes, or bbox changes occur.
       - Unchanged examples: All Blue/Light Blue small components remain Blue/Light Blue across all examples (e.g., Blue [15,1,16,2] in train 1; Light Blue [10,0,14,2] in train 2; Blue [10,7,11,8] in train 3).
       - Changed examples: Red → Green (e.g., [10,13,11,14] in train 1); Dark Red → Green (e.g., [7,0,8,1] and [3,1,4,2] in train 2); Pink → Orange (e.g., [4,1,9,1] and [10,2,13,2] in train 3); Yellow → Orange (e.g., [6,0,6,0] and [5,1,5,1] in train 2). Blue → Green in one case ([2,1,3,2] in train 3), but inconsistent with other Blues staying.
     - **Positional effect on transformation**: Bbox y-coordinate (vertical position) consistently influences which components change—low y values (e.g., y=0–2, "top" of grid) are affected in all examples (e.g., changes at y=0–1 in trains 1/2/3), while higher y (e.g., y=10+) rarely change. Exact threshold unknown.
     - **Adjacency effect on transformation**: Components with bboxes adjacent (x/y differ by ≤1 unit) to medium solid components (#2) or other small components are more likely to change color, consistent across examples (e.g., top-row small blocks near medium lines in all trains). Specific adjacency rule (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical neighbor) unknown.
     - **Connection to large holed component**: All small bboxes are positioned inside the large component's bbox/holes, consistently correlating with potential for color change (no change if isolated, but all are embedded). Effect unknown beyond positional containment.
     - **Inter-small component connection**: Some changes occur in clusters where multiple small bboxes are adjacent (e.g., top-row groups in trains 2/3), suggesting group position → collective color shift, but rule unknown (e.g., why Orange vs. Green).
   - **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Notes**: Not all small components change (e.g., some Red/Pink/Yellow stay the same); rule for Orange vs. Green unknown (possibly original color + position, but not explainable). No consistent pixel or bbox shifts. New small components appear only in train 1 (not every example, so excluded).

#### Unknowns and Non-Interactions
- **Transformation rule for small components**: While position (bbox y/x) and adjacency consistently correlate with color changes to Orange/Green, the precise mechanism (e.g., why specific positions get Orange vs. Green, or interaction with hole positions in the large component) cannot be explained from the data without forcing assumptions.
- **Color-specific effects**: Original color influences outcome (e.g., Red/Dark Red often → Green; Pink/Yellow often → Orange), but not consistently (e.g., exceptions like staying the same or Blue → Green once), so no clear interaction identifiable.
- **No consistent movement or shape changes**: Bbox and pixels are identical for corresponding components; any "transformation" is purely color-based.
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Single-pixel or isolated components without adjacency/overlap show no consistent interaction. Overall grid size (~10x10 to 20x20) is consistent but has no direct effect observable.

This list focuses solely on data-derived, cross-example consistencies. No elements without interactions (e.g., fully isolated small blocks that never change) are included.

[2025-10-03 08:30:44] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data for the three train examples, I analyzed the components (blobs defined by color, holes, bbox, and pixels) in inputs vs. outputs. Only interactions, connections, or effects that are **obvious, consistent across ALL three train examples**, and directly inferable from properties (e.g., position via bbox, color, size via pixels/holes, or potential adjacency via overlapping/nearby bboxes) are listed below. No high-level puzzle solving or forced explanations are included. Components or properties that do not appear in every example (e.g., new small Orange blobs added only in train 1) or lack consistent interaction (e.g., pixel count changes, which vary) are excluded. Transformations that cannot be explained via obvious property interactions are noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Large Holed Component (Background-Like Canvas)**
   - **Description**: One primary large component per example with multiple holes (holes=8 in train 1, holes=4 in train 2, holes=1 in train 3), full-canvas bbox (e.g., [0,0,17,17] or similar spanning the grid), and high pixel count (195+). Color varies by example (Maroon in train 1, Light Blue in train 2, Dark Red in train 3).
   - **Properties**: holes count, bbox (full grid span), pixels (high, representing filled area with cutouts).
   - **Consistent Interaction/Effect**:
     - Remains completely unchanged (color, holes, bbox, pixels identical in input and output across all examples).
     - **Connection to small solid components**: All small solid components (see #3) have bboxes fully contained within or overlapping this large component's bbox in every example, suggesting positional embedding (e.g., placed in "holes" or on the canvas). This positional relationship consistently correlates with small component transformations (see #3), but the exact effect (e.g., which holes influence changes) is unknown—no direct change to the large component itself.
     - No interaction with medium solid components (#2) beyond shared bbox overlap, which is unchanged.
   - **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Notes**: Background color described as purple (input) to yellow (output), but data shows no color change here; possible representation mismatch, but no data-based interaction identifiable.

#### 2. **Medium Solid Components (Structural Outlines or Borders)**
   - **Description**: 1–2 medium-sized components per example with no holes (holes=0), moderate pixel count (32–86), and elongated bboxes suggesting lines/paths (e.g., Maroon [3,2,9,14] pixels=59 in train 1; Light Blue [0,3,12,14] pixels=74 and [5,1,13,6] pixels=32 in train 2; Dark Red [2,2,13,16] pixels=86 and [6,6,15,15] pixels=49 in train 3). Colors vary (Maroon, Light Blue, Dark Red).
   - **Properties**: holes=0, bbox (rectangular, often horizontal/vertical spans), pixels (moderate, indicating connected lines or fills).
   - **Consistent Interaction/Effect**:
     - Remains completely unchanged (color, bbox, pixels identical in input and output across all examples).
     - **Connection to small solid components**: Bboxes of these medium components consistently overlap or are adjacent (e.g., within 1–2 units in x/y) to several small solid components in every example, suggesting structural connection (e.g., small blocks as "nodes" on these "paths"). This adjacency correlates with color changes in some small components (see #3), but the specific effect (e.g., proximity distance threshold) is unknown.
     - **Connection to large holed component**: Bboxes are subsets of the large component's bbox, with no change induced; positional embedding is consistent but has no observable effect on transformation.
   - **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Notes**: Line segments described as black (input) to blue (output), but data shows varying colors with no consistent recoloring here.

#### 3. **Small Solid Components (Colored Blocks or Nodes)**
   - **Description**: Multiple small components per example with no holes (holes=0), low pixel count (1–6, typically 1x1 or thin 1-unit squares/lines), and compact bboxes (e.g., size 1x1 or 1x2). Colors vary (Red/Blue in train 1, Yellow/Dark Red/Pink/Light Blue in train 2, Pink/Blue/Red in train 3).
   - **Properties**: holes=0, bbox (small grid positions, often at edges like low y for "top" placement), pixels (low, indicating discrete blocks).
   - **Consistent Interaction/Effect**:
     - **Color transformation**: In every example, a subset of these components changes color to either Orange or Green in the output, while others remain unchanged. This is the only consistent transformation observed. No size, holes, or bbox changes occur.
       - Unchanged examples: All Blue/Light Blue small components remain Blue/Light Blue across all examples (e.g., Blue [15,1,16,2] in train 1; Light Blue [10,0,14,2] in train 2; Blue [10,7,11,8] in train 3).
       - Changed examples: Red → Green (e.g., [10,13,11,14] in train 1); Dark Red → Green (e.g., [7,0,8,1] and [3,1,4,2] in train 2); Pink → Orange (e.g., [4,1,9,1] and [10,2,13,2] in train 3); Yellow → Orange (e.g., [6,0,6,0] and [5,1,5,1] in train 2). Blue → Green in one case ([2,1,3,2] in train 3), but inconsistent with other Blues staying.
     - **Positional effect on transformation**: Bbox y-coordinate (vertical position) consistently influences which components change—low y values (e.g., y=0–2, "top" of grid) are affected in all examples (e.g., changes at y=0–1 in trains 1/2/3), while higher y (e.g., y=10+) rarely change. Exact threshold unknown.
     - **Adjacency effect on transformation**: Components with bboxes adjacent (x/y differ by ≤1 unit) to medium solid components (#2) or other small components are more likely to change color, consistent across examples (e.g., top-row small blocks near medium lines in all trains). Specific adjacency rule (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical neighbor) unknown.
     - **Connection to large holed component**: All small bboxes are positioned inside the large component's bbox/holes, consistently correlating with potential for color change (no change if isolated, but all are embedded). Effect unknown beyond positional containment.
     - **Inter-small component connection**: Some changes occur in clusters where multiple small bboxes are adjacent (e.g., top-row groups in trains 2/3), suggesting group position → collective color shift, but rule unknown (e.g., why Orange vs. Green).
   - **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Notes**: Not all small components change (e.g., some Red/Pink/Yellow stay the same); rule for Orange vs. Green unknown (possibly original color + position, but not explainable). No consistent pixel or bbox shifts. New small components appear only in train 1 (not every example, so excluded).

#### Unknowns and Non-Interactions
- **Transformation rule for small components**: While position (bbox y/x) and adjacency consistently correlate with color changes to Orange/Green, the precise mechanism (e.g., why specific positions get Orange vs. Green, or interaction with hole positions in the large component) cannot be explained from the data without forcing assumptions.
- **Color-specific effects**: Original color influences outcome (e.g., Red/Dark Red often → Green; Pink/Yellow often → Orange), but not consistently (e.g., exceptions like staying the same or Blue → Green once), so no clear interaction identifiable.
- **No consistent movement or shape changes**: Bbox and pixels are identical for corresponding components; any "transformation" is purely color-based.
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Single-pixel or isolated components without adjacency/overlap show no consistent interaction. Overall grid size (~10x10 to 20x20) is consistent but has no direct effect observable.

This list focuses solely on data-derived, cross-example consistencies. No elements without interactions (e.g., fully isolated small blocks that never change) are included.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:49:12] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids containing various numbers (representing colors or components like 0 for empty, 1 for blue, 2 for something else, etc.) are modified according to specific rules to produce output grids, likely involving selective filling of empties (0s) with orange (5), conditional color changes (e.g., blue 1 to green 3 in some areas), and preserving structural elements (e.g., backgrounds like 8, 9, 7, 4). The goal is to identify patterns from training examples, such as connected components or regions, to apply transformations only where rules match, rather than globally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Not all empty spaces (0s) are filled with orange (5); in train example 1 expected output, many 0s remain unfilled (e.g., positions like row 1 col 7 is 0, row 3 col 5 is 0), suggesting filling is selective, possibly only in certain connected regions, bounded areas, or non-structural empties, while others (e.g., in outlines or specific shapes) stay 0 to maintain transparency or separation.
 * Blue (1) changes to green (3) are not universal; in train example 1 expected, some 1s remain 1 (e.g., row 1-2 col 15-16 are 1s), while others become 3 (e.g., row 14-15 col 4-5 are 3s, possibly from original 1s or other colors); this implies changes based on connectivity, enclosure, or adjacency to other elements like 2s or 5s, not blanket replacement.
 * Structural backgrounds (e.g., 8 in train 1, 9/4/7 in train 2, 7 in train 3) are preserved unchanged, but some non-background elements like 7s in train 2 are transformed to 3s or 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9 expected 3s vs. generated 7s), indicating rules distinguish between fixed structures and mutable components, possibly via flood-fill or component detection.
 * In train example 3 expected, some areas get 5s (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 expected 3,3 but with 5s in row 2 col 10-13), and 1s appear in places like row 7 col 10-11, suggesting introductions of new colors (1 or 5) in enclosed or adjacent regions, and selective filling of 0s only in specific blobs (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 has 5s where generated has 3s incorrectly).
 * Subtle element: Transformations may involve "components" (connected groups of same-number cells, 4- or 8-connected), as hinted in the attempt's docstring; e.g., in train 1, blue components near certain shapes change, but isolated ones don't—need to detect and classify components by size, shape, or enclosure.
 * Across examples, 2s (possibly red or objects) remain unchanged, 5s (orange) are added selectively, and greens (3) replace blues (1) or other colors (like 7s in train 2) only in "interior" or bounded areas; empties in "exteriors" or outlines stay 0.
 * Potential oversight: Rules might prioritize "filling holes" in objects (e.g., enclosed 0s become 5), changing colors based on surrounding structures (e.g., 1 inside a 2-shape becomes 3), and no global changes—requires spatial analysis like bounding boxes or adjacency checks.
 * All training outputs are incorrect, showing over-application: generated fills EVERY 0 to 5 (but expected keeps many 0s) and changes EVERY 1 to 3 (but expected keeps some 1s and changes others conditionally).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No truly helpful functions were provided in this attempt; the existing ones are overly simplistic and broken for the puzzle:
```python
# This function is broken: It fills ALL 0s indiscriminately, but puzzle requires selective filling (e.g., only enclosed or specific regions). Not helpful—avoid in future.
def fill_empty_spaces_with_orange(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 0:
                new_g[i][j] = 5
    return new_g
```
```python
# This function is broken: Changes ALL 1s to 3s, but some 1s must remain (e.g., train 1 top-right). Not helpful without component detection—avoid or modify to target specific connected 1-groups.
def change_blue_components_to_green(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 1:
                new_g[i][j] = 3
    return new_g
```
```python
# This is a no-op (identity function), which is correct for preserving structures but unhelpful alone—puzzle needs it combined with conditional logic.
def keep_structural_elements_unchanged(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
Future attempts should include tools like:
```python
# Suggested: Detect connected components (e.g., using flood-fill) to classify regions for selective changes.
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Basic flood-fill to get positions of connected cells with target_val; return set of (i,j) for analysis (e.g., size, enclosure).
    # Implementation omitted for brevity, but essential for identifying "components" mentioned in attempt docstrings.
    pass
```
```python
# Suggested: Check if a region is "enclosed" (e.g., surrounded by non-0/non-target walls) to decide filling or color change.
def is_enclosed(g: List[List[int]], component_positions: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    # Analyze bounding box or adjacency to background (e.g., 8/9/7/4); true if no path to edge.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) blindly fills all 0s with 5 and all 1s with 3, ignoring selectivity—resulting in train 1 generated having extra 5s where expected has 0s (e.g., row 1 col 7: generated 5 vs. expected 0; row 3 col 5: 5 vs. 0) and extra 3s where expected has 1s (e.g., row 1 col 15-16: 3 vs. 1), and missing new 3s in bottom (e.g., row 14 col 4-5: generated 2? wait, actually 3 from change, but positions mismatch overall).
 * Train 2 mismatches heavily: generated keeps 7s and 4s unchanged where expected changes to 3s and 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9: generated 7,7 vs. expected 3,3; row 0 col 6 and 9: 4 vs. 5), and no 0-filling needed here but over-applies if any 0s present—suggests 7s or other colors change conditionally to 3/5, not just 1s.
 * Train 3 mismatches: generated changes 1s? but expected introduces 5s in places like row 2 col 2-3 (generated 3 vs. expected 5? wait, row 2: generated 3,3,7,...5,5,... but expected 3,3,7,...5,5,... wait, partial match but row 3 col 2: generated 6 vs. expected 5; and adds 1s in row 7-8 col 10-11 expected but generated likely 3 if 1s present, or unchanged—unknown input but shows over-changing.
 * Missed core: No component extraction or enclosure checks, leading to global ops instead of rule-based (e.g., fill enclosed 0s, change interior 1s).
 * The "keep_structural_elements_unchanged" is correct in intent but trivial/unhelpful without integration.
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, which is essential for subtleties like connected blues or holes—future needs flood-fill or similar.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding (e.g., orange for empties, green for blues, preserve structures) but fails execution due to lack of conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same global rules (fill 0s to 5, 1s to 3), resulting in widespread 5s (e.g., row 8 col 6-8: 5,5,5 likely from 0s) and 3s preserved/changed (e.g., many 3s in rows 2-4 and 12-15, possibly original or from 1s), but given training failures, this likely over-fills empties (e.g., scattered 5s in row 8-9 may be where expected keeps 0s or other values) and incorrectly changes components (e.g., bottom rows have 5s in row 20-21 col 21-23, which might be selective in expected but global here).
 * It mismatches puzzle subtleties: e.g., dense 4-background preserved (good), but 3-clusters in top/mid (rows 2-4 col 5-12 and 20-23) seem unchanged, yet if input had 1s there, changing all would be wrong per train 1; scattered 5s (e.g., row 8 col 20-21: 3,3 but nearby 5s) suggest unfilled areas should remain 0 or get different treatment.
 * Does not make sense as final output—looks like a naive transformation without spatial rules, e.g., no evident selective filling for enclosed regions (test grid has complex shapes like 9-blobs and 3-lines, likely needing component-based changes); expected probably keeps some 0s (not shown, but inferred from trains) and conditional 1-to-3 or other swaps (e.g., some 9s or 4s to 5/3?).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 08:49:35] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 08:51:10] Response:
### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, below is a list of components and their properties that show consistent interactions or effects across **all** three train inputs/outputs. I focused only on elements with clear, repeated connections (e.g., one property influencing another) that appear in every example. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., added components in train 1 only, or one-off position effects not seen in all) are excluded. Where a connection cannot be explained without assuming a full rule (i.e., the exact mechanism is unknown), I note it as such. No high-level puzzle interpretation or solution is included.

#### Core Components
- **Small tiles**: Bounded objects with holes=0, pixels ≤4 (typically 1, 2, or 4), small bbox (width/height ≤2 units). Colors include Red, Blue, Yellow, Pink, Dark Red (varying per example, but always present as small tiles).
- **Large frame structures**: Bounded objects with pixels 19–86, holes=0 or 1, medium bbox (spanning ~10–15 units in one dimension). Colors: Maroon (train 1), Light Blue (train 2), Dark Red (train 3).
- **Enclosing background**: Single object with full bbox ([0,0,N,N] where N=17–19), holes ≥1 (8 in train 1, 4 in train 2, 1 in train 3), pixels 74–195. Colors: Maroon (train 1), Light Blue (train 2), Dark Red (train 3). Always spans the entire canvas.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are properties/effects observed in every train example, where one element reliably influences another. Only direct, obvious links (e.g., via color, position, or structural properties) are included if they hold across all cases.

1. **Enclosing background's holes property affects small tiles' color stability**:
   - Small tiles overlapping or adjacent (bbox intersection or edge proximity ≤1 unit) to the enclosing background's holed regions (inferred from holes count >0) consistently either retain their original color or undergo a color change to Orange/Green.
   - Effect: No small tile fully disappears or gains holes; changes are limited to color. This interaction is structural (holes enable the effect) and consistent, but the exact trigger for Orange vs. Green is unknown (position or color-based rule not uniformly explainable across examples).
   - Example consistency: In all trains, ~20–50% of small tiles near holed background change color; distant ones (bbox offset >5 units) always stay unchanged.

2. **Small tiles' color interacts with large frame structure's color for partial transformation to Orange**:
   - Small tiles matching or similar to the large frame's color (e.g., Red near Maroon in train 1, Yellow near Light Blue in train 2, Pink near Dark Red in train 3) consistently transform to Orange if their bbox overlaps the frame's bbox by ≥50% area.
   - Effect: Transformed tiles retain holes=0, pixels, and bbox but change color to Orange. Unchanged tiles (low overlap) retain original color.
   - Example consistency: Occurs in 3–6 small tiles per example; frame color acts as a "matcher" for Orange shift, seen in every train.

3. **Small tiles' position (bbox y-coordinate) interacts with enclosing background for Green transformation**:
   - Small tiles with high y-bbox values (≥12 in all examples, indicating lower canvas position) and non-frame-matching colors (e.g., Blue in trains 1/3, Dark Red in train 2) consistently transform to Green when adjacent to the background (bbox edge distance ≤2 units).
   - Effect: Color changes to Green; other properties (holes, pixels, x-bbox) unchanged. This is position-driven (y affects movement-like shift) and tied to background adjacency.
   - Example consistency: 1–8 tiles per example affected; always lower-position tiles, no exceptions across trains.

4. **Large frame structure's pixels property stabilizes against change**:
   - The large frame's pixel count (≥19) consistently prevents any transformation of itself or directly embedded small tiles (bbox fully inside frame).
   - Effect: Frame color, holes, bbox, and pixels remain identical in input/output. Embedded small tiles (if present) do not change color.
   - Example consistency: Frame unchanged in all three outputs; no pixel loss/gain or hole alteration.

#### Unknown or Unexplainable Connections
- Specific rule for Orange vs. Green distinction beyond position/holes adjacency: Consistent that both occur, but why a tile becomes one vs. the other (e.g., exact bbox overlap ratio or color hue matching) cannot be pinpointed without forcing inconsistent assumptions across trains.
- Effect of small tiles' x-bbox (horizontal position) on transformations: Appears in isolated cases (e.g., left-side Green in train 3), but not repeated in every example, so excluded.
- Interaction between multiple small tiles (e.g., clustering or pixel density): No consistent effect; some clusters change uniformly, others do not, across trains.

No other interactions (e.g., hole creation, bbox shifting, or silhouette-based effects) are consistent in every puzzle. Elements like isolated small tiles far from the background show no effects in any example.

[2025-10-03 08:51:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, below is a list of components and their properties that show consistent interactions or effects across **all** three train inputs/outputs. I focused only on elements with clear, repeated connections (e.g., one property influencing another) that appear in every example. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., added components in train 1 only, or one-off position effects not seen in all) are excluded. Where a connection cannot be explained without assuming a full rule (i.e., the exact mechanism is unknown), I note it as such. No high-level puzzle interpretation or solution is included.

#### Core Components
- **Small tiles**: Bounded objects with holes=0, pixels ≤4 (typically 1, 2, or 4), small bbox (width/height ≤2 units). Colors include Red, Blue, Yellow, Pink, Dark Red (varying per example, but always present as small tiles).
- **Large frame structures**: Bounded objects with pixels 19–86, holes=0 or 1, medium bbox (spanning ~10–15 units in one dimension). Colors: Maroon (train 1), Light Blue (train 2), Dark Red (train 3).
- **Enclosing background**: Single object with full bbox ([0,0,N,N] where N=17–19), holes ≥1 (8 in train 1, 4 in train 2, 1 in train 3), pixels 74–195. Colors: Maroon (train 1), Light Blue (train 2), Dark Red (train 3). Always spans the entire canvas.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are properties/effects observed in every train example, where one element reliably influences another. Only direct, obvious links (e.g., via color, position, or structural properties) are included if they hold across all cases.

1. **Enclosing background's holes property affects small tiles' color stability**:
   - Small tiles overlapping or adjacent (bbox intersection or edge proximity ≤1 unit) to the enclosing background's holed regions (inferred from holes count >0) consistently either retain their original color or undergo a color change to Orange/Green.
   - Effect: No small tile fully disappears or gains holes; changes are limited to color. This interaction is structural (holes enable the effect) and consistent, but the exact trigger for Orange vs. Green is unknown (position or color-based rule not uniformly explainable across examples).
   - Example consistency: In all trains, ~20–50% of small tiles near holed background change color; distant ones (bbox offset >5 units) always stay unchanged.

2. **Small tiles' color interacts with large frame structure's color for partial transformation to Orange**:
   - Small tiles matching or similar to the large frame's color (e.g., Red near Maroon in train 1, Yellow near Light Blue in train 2, Pink near Dark Red in train 3) consistently transform to Orange if their bbox overlaps the frame's bbox by ≥50% area.
   - Effect: Transformed tiles retain holes=0, pixels, and bbox but change color to Orange. Unchanged tiles (low overlap) retain original color.
   - Example consistency: Occurs in 3–6 small tiles per example; frame color acts as a "matcher" for Orange shift, seen in every train.

3. **Small tiles' position (bbox y-coordinate) interacts with enclosing background for Green transformation**:
   - Small tiles with high y-bbox values (≥12 in all examples, indicating lower canvas position) and non-frame-matching colors (e.g., Blue in trains 1/3, Dark Red in train 2) consistently transform to Green when adjacent to the background (bbox edge distance ≤2 units).
   - Effect: Color changes to Green; other properties (holes, pixels, x-bbox) unchanged. This is position-driven (y affects movement-like shift) and tied to background adjacency.
   - Example consistency: 1–8 tiles per example affected; always lower-position tiles, no exceptions across trains.

4. **Large frame structure's pixels property stabilizes against change**:
   - The large frame's pixel count (≥19) consistently prevents any transformation of itself or directly embedded small tiles (bbox fully inside frame).
   - Effect: Frame color, holes, bbox, and pixels remain identical in input/output. Embedded small tiles (if present) do not change color.
   - Example consistency: Frame unchanged in all three outputs; no pixel loss/gain or hole alteration.

#### Unknown or Unexplainable Connections
- Specific rule for Orange vs. Green distinction beyond position/holes adjacency: Consistent that both occur, but why a tile becomes one vs. the other (e.g., exact bbox overlap ratio or color hue matching) cannot be pinpointed without forcing inconsistent assumptions across trains.
- Effect of small tiles' x-bbox (horizontal position) on transformations: Appears in isolated cases (e.g., left-side Green in train 3), but not repeated in every example, so excluded.
- Interaction between multiple small tiles (e.g., clustering or pixel density): No consistent effect; some clusters change uniformly, others do not, across trains.

No other interactions (e.g., hole creation, bbox shifting, or silhouette-based effects) are consistent in every puzzle. Elements like isolated small tiles far from the background show no effects in any example.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 09:03:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or "tiles" of the same color) must be identified and selectively recolored based on structural rules like size, position, adjacency to background, and relationships to larger elements (e.g., a "frame"). The goal is to transform an input grid into a target output by applying color changes (e.g., to 3/green or 5/orange) to specific small components while leaving others unchanged, with the background color (often 8, 9, 7, or 4) remaining dominant.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; the code uses these directions but adds diagonals in some checks, which may overcount adjacency).
 * Small tiles are defined narrowly (≤4 pixels, bounding box ≤2x2), but this may miss some targets if they are slightly larger or irregularly shaped; expected outputs show small groups (1-4 pixels) being recolored, but not all.
 * A "large frame" is hypothesized as a big enclosing component (19-86 pixels, span 10-15), but this criterion fails to consistently identify the relevant structure across examples—e.g., in Train 1, the frame seems vertical/horizontal borders, but the rule doesn't trigger correctly.
 * Overlap with frame: Only changes small tiles of the same color as the frame if overlap ≥0.5, but this doesn't match expectations (e.g., Train 1 expects some 0s and 1s to stay or change differently, not to 5).
 * Lower position: Tiles in the bottom half (center_y ≥ n/2) that are adjacent to background (including diagonals) and not frame-colored change to 3, but this over-applies (e.g., Train 1 generates extra 3s in bottom where expected has 5s or 0s) and misses upper placements.
 * Zero-filling: Small 0-components adjacent to background change to 5, but this interacts poorly with other rules (applied after, so overrides might miss cases).
 * Background is top-left cell, assumed uniform, but grids have consistent borders (e.g., 8 in Train 1, 9 in Train 2).
 * Order of rules matters: Overlap first, then lower position, then zeros— but this sequence causes cascading errors (e.g., a tile changed to 5 early skips green rule).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes diagonals in some checks, but may not for component finding; zeros (0) are treated specially but may represent "empty" small tiles needing context-specific colors; not all small tiles change—some stay original (e.g., 1s, 2s in expectations); large components (e.g., frames) must not be altered; grids are square (18x18, 15x15, 20x20), but test is 30x30—scale rules accordingly.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected changes are to 5 in upper areas (not just lower), suggesting position rule is inverted or conditional; Train 3 shows symmetric changes (e.g., 1s to nothing, but 3s expand); colors like 1,2,6 may be "noise" or fixed; no rule for propagating colors between similar components.
 * All rules assume one large frame, but examples may have multiple large structures or none; pixel counts and bbox spans are heuristics that don't fit all (e.g., Train 2's frame seems irregular).

def apply_color_change(grid: List[List[int]], comp: Dict, new_color: int):
    for i, j in comp['positions']:
        grid[i][j] = new_color  # Basic but essential for modifications
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it fails all three training examples by applying incorrect color changes based on flawed rule heuristics.
 * Train 1: Generated changes several upper small tiles (e.g., positions around row 2-3, col 7-10 from 0/8 to 5; row 3 col 14-15 from 8 to 5) where expected keeps 0s or changes to other colors; bottom greens (3s) are placed too broadly (e.g., row 9-15 col 3-4 are 3s, but expected has 1s there initially changing differently); zeros filled to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 3 col 9 stays 0 in expected but becomes 5? Wait, no—generated has 0s in places expected has 5s, like row 3 col 16); overall, too many 5s in mid-upper, missing 5s in right column (e.g., row 3-9 col 16 expected 5, generated 0/8).
 * Train 2: Generated keeps some 7s as 3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 col 7-8 to nothing, but expected 5/3; row 7 col 7-8 stay 3 but expected 7); changes bottom 3s too early (row 9-14 col 2-3 to 3, expected 7/4); misses frame overlap (e.g., left frame 4s not propagating to 5); small tiles like row 0 col 6-9 expected 5/3 but generated 4/7; unknown why adjacency rule skips some lower 7s to 3 when expected keeps them.
 * Train 3: Generated fails to change upper 1s/6s to 5/3 (e.g., row 1 col 2-3 stay 1, expected 3; row 8-9 col 1-2 stay 6/5? Expected has 5s expanding left); bottom 3s over-applied (row 10-16 col 7-8 to 3/1, but expected 1/6); frame (background 7) adjacency changes zeros/ smalls wrong (no zeros here, but small 1s/2s not recolored correctly); misses symmetric left-side changes (e.g., row 7-10 col 1 to 5 in expected, generated 6).
 * Rule_orange_from_frame_overlap is broken/not helpful: Triggers too few/often on wrong color matches, missing cases where non-same-color tiles need orange.
 * Rule_green_from_lower_position over-applies to non-adjacent tiles and skips upper ones that need green/orange.
 * Rule_fill_small_zeros helps partially (fills some 0s to 5 adjacent to bg), but interacts badly (e.g., Train 1 fills upper 0s to 5 where expected keeps 0 or changes later).
 * Rule_stabilize_large_frame is unhelpful/irrelevant: Does nothing, but large components need protection—consider expanding to avoid any large changes.
 * Find_large_frame is flawed: Pixel/span ranges don't capture irregular frames (e.g., Train 3's vertical bars not 10-15 span); may return None, skipping rules.
 * Overall, component extraction works (find_components correctly identifies blobs), but rule logic demonstrates poor understanding—changes don't align with patterns like "fill gaps in frames" or "color based on enclosure."

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It appears to copy the input almost unchanged (e.g., all 1s, 9s, 0s stay as-is, no recoloring observed in the printed grid), suggesting rules failed to trigger (e.g., no 3s or 5s added, despite small 0s/1s tiles present like row 8 col 6-8 0s adjacent to 4 bg; upper 9s/1s not changed to frame-like 5). This mismatches puzzle intent, as trainings show small tiles (e.g., 0s,1s) should recolor to 3/5 based on position/adjacency—here, lower 0s (row 19-21 col 21-23) stay 0, upper 1s stay 1. Likely, large_frame detection fails on the 30x30 scale (borders are 4, but inner structures like horizontal 9s/1s bars may not fit 19-86 pixels), and small_tile filter misses some (e.g., the 7-pixel 1s in row 2-4 col 5-11). No changes mean the program didn't apply rules effectively, making output senseless for the puzzle—expect more 5s in frame-overlaps (e.g., inner 1s bars) and 3s in lower isolated tiles.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 09:04:37] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed **across EVERY puzzle** (i.e., present in Train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties like color, position (bbox), size (pixels), and holes that show reliable cause-effect or linkage between input and output elements. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., unchanged large fills without interaction) are excluded. Inconsistent changes (e.g., addition of entirely new components, as seen only in Train 1) are not listed. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained from the data (e.g., exact trigger for specific color shifts), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Small accent components (pixels ≤ 4, holes = 0) interact with their position (bbox) relative to structural elements, resulting in color transformation**:
   - Input small accents (colors: Red, Blue, Dark Red, Yellow, Pink) consistently change color in the output to either Green or Orange, while bbox, pixels, and holes remain identical.
   - Examples across all trains:
     - Train 1: Red ([10,13,11,14], pixels=4) → Green; Red ([4,14,5,15], pixels=4) → Green.
     - Train 2: Dark Red ([7,0,8,1], pixels=4) → Green; Dark Red ([3,1,4,2], pixels=4) → Green; Yellow ([6,0,6,0], pixels=1) → Orange; Yellow ([5,1,5,1], pixels=1) → Orange.
     - Train 3: Blue ([2,1,3,2], pixels=4) → Green; Pink ([4,1,9,1], pixels=6, but effectively small/compact) → Orange; Pink ([10,2,13,2], pixels=4) → Orange.
   - Connection: Position (bbox coordinates) links the component to the fixed structural lines/background (e.g., adjacency or overlap with large Maroon/Dark Red/Light Blue blobs), triggering the color change. Not all small accents change (e.g., some Blues/Pinks/Yellows stay the same), so the exact positional rule (e.g., specific x/y thresholds or proximity distance) is unknown.
   - No movement or size alteration; purely color effect.

2. **Structural line components (pixels > 4, no holes or holes > 0) remain unchanged, serving as fixed interactors for small accents**:
   - Large components (e.g., Maroon [3,2,9,14] pixels=59 in Train 1; Light Blue [0,3,12,14] holes=4 pixels=74 in Train 2; Dark Red [2,2,13,16] pixels=86 in Train 3) show identical color, bbox, pixels, and holes in input and output.
   - Connection: These act as static "anchors" that small accents interact with via position (e.g., bbox overlap or edge adjacency), but without altering the structural components themselves. This interaction is consistent as the trigger for small accent color changes (per item 1), but the structural lines do not transform or propagate changes outward.
   - Background canvases (large hole-bearing components like Maroon holes=8 in Train 1, Light Blue holes=4 in Train 2, Dark Red holes=1 in Train 3) follow the same unchanged pattern, reinforcing positional stability for interactions.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., hole count affecting color, silhouette/edge properties influencing movement, or cross-component color propagation) are observable across all examples, as they either vary (e.g., only Train 1 adds new small Oranges potentially linked to unknown position-based creation) or lack evidence in the data (e.g., no consistent bbox shifts or pixel count changes). Transformations like "Red/Dark Red/Blue → Green" vs. "Yellow/Pink → Orange" appear pattern-like but are not fully consistent (e.g., not all instances follow, and positions vary), so the precise color-to-color mapping rule is unknown.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 09:06:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where numbers represent colors or object types (e.g., 1,2,3,5 for different elements, 8/7/9/4 likely for borders or backgrounds), and zeros indicate empty spaces that may or may not need filling based on rules. The goal appears to be transforming the input grid by applying color mappings, completing shapes, or filling specific regions while preserving empties in certain areas, rather than a uniform fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Zeros (empty spaces) are not always filled; in expected outputs, some remain 0 (e.g., scattered empties inside shapes in training example 1), suggesting selective filling based on proximity to objects, containment, or pattern completion—uniform filling with 5 (orange) overwrites these and fails.
 * Existing numbers sometimes change values (e.g., in training example 1, bottom-right 2,2 pairs become 3,3 in expected, while top 2,2 stay 2,2; in example 2, some 7's become 3's and 4's become 5's), indicating rule-based recoloring, possibly mapping colors by object type, size, or position (e.g., symmetric or mirrored changes).
 * Background/border values (8 in ex1, 9 in ex2, 7 in ex3, 4 in test) remain unchanged, but inner regions show pattern extensions or fills (e.g., in ex1, new 3,3 blocks appear where input might have had partials or empties; in ex3, 1,1 and 6,6 extend into 5's or 3's).
 * Shapes seem to be "objects" like blobs or lines (e.g., pairs of 1's, 2's, 6's), which may need extraction for analysis—rules could involve counting connected components, filling enclosed areas, or applying color swaps based on global patterns (e.g., orange 5 fills some but not all voids).
 * Subtle: Outputs maintain grid structure but alter internals; empties near borders or outside shapes stay 0, while those inside get filled (but not always with 5—e.g., ex1 has 0's inside what looks like a frame). Possible symmetry or mirroring (e.g., ex1 has mirrored 1,1 and 2,2 placements). Avoid over-filling, as it breaks expected 0 preservation. Consider object adjacency or flooding from seeds.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): No object extraction, so misses identifying regions; uniform fill ignores why some 0's stay (e.g., non-contiguous empties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid without modification—useful as a base for safe transformations."""

    Assumes 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right). Returns list of (i,j) positions."""

        return []

(Note: No other functions from the attempt are helpful; `fill_zeros_with_orange` is broken as it uniformly fills all 0's, ignoring selective rules, and should not be reused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly copies the grid and fills all 0's with 5 (orange), which works for preserving non-zero values and borders but fails entirely on selective filling—e.g., in train1, it turns expected internal 0's (like row2 col7=0) into 5's, but expected keeps them 0; also mismatches recoloring (e.g., row14 col10-11=2,2 becomes 3,3 in expected, but attempt leaves as 2,2).
 * In train1, generated has extra 5's in places like row3 col6=5 (expected 0), and bottom 2,2 unchanged where expected has 3,3—difference unknown but likely due to missing color mapping for specific object types (e.g., bottom blobs are a different "color" class).
 * In train2, generated leaves some values like 7's and 4's unchanged (e.g., row1 col7-8=7,7 becomes 3,3 in expected), filling 0's with 5's incorrectly (e.g., row1 col6=5 in expected but was 0? Wait, input not shown, but output shows mismatches like row0 col6=4 in generated vs 5 in expected)—indicates no recoloring logic.
 * In train3, generated keeps 1's as 1's and 6's as 6's (e.g., row1 col2-3=1,1 unchanged, but expected has 3,3), and fills 0's with 5's where expected extends patterns differently (e.g., row2 col10-13=6,6,6,6 becomes 5,5,5,5)—suggests missing blob extension or type-based filling.
 * No extraction of objects, so can't identify why some regions (e.g., enclosed 0's) get filled vs. others stay empty; uniform approach misses all subtleties like color swaps (2->3, 1->3? patterns).
 * `fill_zeros_with_orange` is unhelpful/broken: it over-fills and ignores recoloring, leading to all training failures; do not reuse without conditions (e.g., only fill if adjacent to certain objects).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of the input with 0's filled as 5's (e.g., row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where likely 0's were), but preserves input numbers like 9's,1's, and a single 5, while borders are 4's unchanged. This mismatches the pattern from training, where outputs involve recoloring (e.g., no 2->3-like changes here, and scattered 0's should likely remain in non-shape areas like inside the 9/1 frames). It looks incorrect because it doesn't complete or alter shapes (e.g., the 1,1 pairs and 9 blocks seem unextended, unlike train1's 3,3 additions); instead, it's just a lazy fill, ignoring why train examples needed specific changes. To fix, need rules for object detection (e.g., treat 1's as one type to extend/fill around) and handle larger grid (30 cols) with possible symmetry in the 9/1/5 regions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids containing various numbers (representing colors or components like 0 for empty, 1 for blue, 2 for something else, etc.) are modified according to specific rules to produce output grids, likely involving selective filling of empties (0s) with orange (5), conditional color changes (e.g., blue 1 to green 3 in some areas), and preserving structural elements (e.g., backgrounds like 8, 9, 7, 4). The goal is to identify patterns from training examples, such as connected components or regions, to apply transformations only where rules match, rather than globally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Not all empty spaces (0s) are filled with orange (5); in train example 1 expected output, many 0s remain unfilled (e.g., positions like row 1 col 7 is 0, row 3 col 5 is 0), suggesting filling is selective, possibly only in certain connected regions, bounded areas, or non-structural empties, while others (e.g., in outlines or specific shapes) stay 0 to maintain transparency or separation.
 * Blue (1) changes to green (3) are not universal; in train example 1 expected, some 1s remain 1 (e.g., row 1-2 col 15-16 are 1s), while others become 3 (e.g., row 14-15 col 4-5 are 3s, possibly from original 1s or other colors); this implies changes based on connectivity, enclosure, or adjacency to other elements like 2s or 5s, not blanket replacement.
 * Structural backgrounds (e.g., 8 in train 1, 9/4/7 in train 2, 7 in train 3) are preserved unchanged, but some non-background elements like 7s in train 2 are transformed to 3s or 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9 expected 3s vs. generated 7s), indicating rules distinguish between fixed structures and mutable components, possibly via flood-fill or component detection.
 * In train example 3 expected, some areas get 5s (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 expected 3,3 but with 5s in row 2 col 10-13), and 1s appear in places like row 7 col 10-11, suggesting introductions of new colors (1 or 5) in enclosed or adjacent regions, and selective filling of 0s only in specific blobs (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 has 5s where generated has 3s incorrectly).
 * Subtle element: Transformations may involve "components" (connected groups of same-number cells, 4- or 8-connected), as hinted in the attempt's docstring; e.g., in train 1, blue components near certain shapes change, but isolated ones don't—need to detect and classify components by size, shape, or enclosure.
 * Across examples, 2s (possibly red or objects) remain unchanged, 5s (orange) are added selectively, and greens (3) replace blues (1) or other colors (like 7s in train 2) only in "interior" or bounded areas; empties in "exteriors" or outlines stay 0.
 * Potential oversight: Rules might prioritize "filling holes" in objects (e.g., enclosed 0s become 5), changing colors based on surrounding structures (e.g., 1 inside a 2-shape becomes 3), and no global changes—requires spatial analysis like bounding boxes or adjacency checks.
 * All training outputs are incorrect, showing over-application: generated fills EVERY 0 to 5 (but expected keeps many 0s) and changes EVERY 1 to 3 (but expected keeps some 1s and changes others conditionally).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No truly helpful functions were provided in this attempt; the existing ones are overly simplistic and broken for the puzzle:
```python
# This function is broken: It fills ALL 0s indiscriminately, but puzzle requires selective filling (e.g., only enclosed or specific regions). Not helpful—avoid in future.
def fill_empty_spaces_with_orange(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 0:
                new_g[i][j] = 5
    return new_g
```
```python
# This function is broken: Changes ALL 1s to 3s, but some 1s must remain (e.g., train 1 top-right). Not helpful without component detection—avoid or modify to target specific connected 1-groups.
def change_blue_components_to_green(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 1:
                new_g[i][j] = 3
    return new_g
```
```python
# This is a no-op (identity function), which is correct for preserving structures but unhelpful alone—puzzle needs it combined with conditional logic.
def keep_structural_elements_unchanged(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
Future attempts should include tools like:
```python
# Suggested: Detect connected components (e.g., using flood-fill) to classify regions for selective changes.
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Basic flood-fill to get positions of connected cells with target_val; return set of (i,j) for analysis (e.g., size, enclosure).
    # Implementation omitted for brevity, but essential for identifying "components" mentioned in attempt docstrings.
    pass
```
```python
# Suggested: Check if a region is "enclosed" (e.g., surrounded by non-0/non-target walls) to decide filling or color change.
def is_enclosed(g: List[List[int]], component_positions: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    # Analyze bounding box or adjacency to background (e.g., 8/9/7/4); true if no path to edge.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) blindly fills all 0s with 5 and all 1s with 3, ignoring selectivity—resulting in train 1 generated having extra 5s where expected has 0s (e.g., row 1 col 7: generated 5 vs. expected 0; row 3 col 5: 5 vs. 0) and extra 3s where expected has 1s (e.g., row 1 col 15-16: 3 vs. 1), and missing new 3s in bottom (e.g., row 14 col 4-5: generated 2? wait, actually 3 from change, but positions mismatch overall).
 * Train 2 mismatches heavily: generated keeps 7s and 4s unchanged where expected changes to 3s and 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9: generated 7,7 vs. expected 3,3; row 0 col 6 and 9: 4 vs. 5), and no 0-filling needed here but over-applies if any 0s present—suggests 7s or other colors change conditionally to 3/5, not just 1s.
 * Train 3 mismatches: generated changes 1s? but expected introduces 5s in places like row 2 col 2-3 (generated 3 vs. expected 5? wait, row 2: generated 3,3,7,...5,5,... but expected 3,3,7,...5,5,... wait, partial match but row 3 col 2: generated 6 vs. expected 5; and adds 1s in row 7-8 col 10-11 expected but generated likely 3 if 1s present, or unchanged—unknown input but shows over-changing.
 * Missed core: No component extraction or enclosure checks, leading to global ops instead of rule-based (e.g., fill enclosed 0s, change interior 1s).
 * The "keep_structural_elements_unchanged" is correct in intent but trivial/unhelpful without integration.
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, which is essential for subtleties like connected blues or holes—future needs flood-fill or similar.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding (e.g., orange for empties, green for blues, preserve structures) but fails execution due to lack of conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same global rules (fill 0s to 5, 1s to 3), resulting in widespread 5s (e.g., row 8 col 6-8: 5,5,5 likely from 0s) and 3s preserved/changed (e.g., many 3s in rows 2-4 and 12-15, possibly original or from 1s), but given training failures, this likely over-fills empties (e.g., scattered 5s in row 8-9 may be where expected keeps 0s or other values) and incorrectly changes components (e.g., bottom rows have 5s in row 20-21 col 21-23, which might be selective in expected but global here).
 * It mismatches puzzle subtleties: e.g., dense 4-background preserved (good), but 3-clusters in top/mid (rows 2-4 col 5-12 and 20-23) seem unchanged, yet if input had 1s there, changing all would be wrong per train 1; scattered 5s (e.g., row 8 col 20-21: 3,3 but nearby 5s) suggest unfilled areas should remain 0 or get different treatment.
 * Does not make sense as final output—looks like a naive transformation without spatial rules, e.g., no evident selective filling for enclosed regions (test grid has complex shapes like 9-blobs and 3-lines, likely needing component-based changes); expected probably keeps some 0s (not shown, but inferred from trains) and conditional 1-to-3 or other swaps (e.g., some 9s or 4s to 5/3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where cells with numeric values (0-9) represent colors, empty space (0), or background, and the task is to identify connected components (likely 8-connected, including diagonals) of specific "object" colors, evaluate their visibility or positioning relative to borders (e.g., top, left, bottom), repaint them with target colors (often 3 or 5), perform flood fills on empty (0) areas from certain seeds or borders to distinguish enclosed vs. open spaces, and handle special cases based on the background color (e.g., bg=8 triggers unique rules). The output transforms the input grid into a segmented or labeled version, preserving background and non-objects while marking "visible" or "enclosed" regions appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), not just 4-connected, as the extraction uses all 8 directions; this is crucial for identifying blob-like objects that touch diagonally.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and it varies across examples (8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3); rules must adapt to bg, e.g., non-bg cells !=0 are potential objects, but 0 is empty/space to fill or flood.
 * Visibility checks: "Top visible" means at least one cell in the component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; "left visible" similarly checks left in the same row. These determine if an object is "exposed" from edges, triggering repaints (e.g., greens to 3 if top-visible, oranges to 5 if top- or left-visible).
 * Special case for bg=8: Only components of color 2 that "touch bottom" (any cell with row >= n-3) get painted to 3; this seems like a "grounded" or "falling" object rule, but the threshold (n-3) may be too loose or arbitrary.
 * Flood filling: Two types—(1) flood_from_seeds starts from cells with values in {1,3,5} and spreads to adjacent 0's (8 directions) with 5, but only marks visited 0's without fully propagating from new 5's in the queue (potential bug: it sets to 5 but queue only adds direct neighbors, not chaining fully? Wait, it does chain via while loop); (2) fill_enclosed_zeros floods from all border 0's (top/bottom/left/right edges) using BFS on 0's (8 directions), marks open/connected-to-border 0's as visited, then paints remaining (enclosed) 0's to 5. This distinguishes holes/ enclosed spaces from outer space.
 * Color groups: "Greens" [1,7,9] painted to 3 if top-visible (perhaps "sky" or "falling from top" objects); "oranges" [4,6] to 5 if top- or left-visible (side-exposed). But in train2 (bg=9), 9 is treated as green but is actually bg in expected, causing overpainting. 2's handled specially only for bg=8.
 * Subtleties: Do not paint bg itself (e.g., in train2, 9 stays 9); 0's on borders are "open" and stay 0 if not enclosed, but enclosed 0's become 5. Components must ignore bg and 0 in connectivity. Bottom-touch in bg=8 uses a fixed offset (n-3), which might miss if grid size varies or "bottom" means stricter (e.g., i == n-1). Flood seeds {1,3,5} suggest painting after initial repaints to propagate "influence." Diagonal connectivity can merge objects unexpectedly. In train1, some 0's stay 0 in expected (open spaces), but generated fills them wrongly. No handling for other colors (e.g., 5 in input?).
 * Easy-to-miss: After repainting components, re-run floods on the updated grid (out), as new 3/5 can seed further fills. But in code, flood_from_seeds runs before fill_enclosed_zeros, which uses original g for flooding (bug: should use out?). Visited in floods must reset per call. For bg!=8, no bottom-touch logic, but train3 suggests similar positioning rules for other colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it fails all training examples due to incorrect color grouping and overpainting (e.g., treats input 9 as "green" object in train2, but 9 is bg and should stay unchanged).
 * For train1 (bg=8): Generated correctly paints some bottom 2's to 3 (e.g., row14 col4-5, row15 col4-5 match expected), and some 5's on right (e.g., row3 col16-17), but wrongly paints extra 3's (row13 col10-11 as 3,3 but expected 3,3? Wait, row13 expected has 3,3 at col10-11? No—generated has 3,3 there but expected has them lower; actually, generated fills too many 0's to 5 (e.g., row3 col14=5 but expected=0; row6 col2=5 but expected=0; row8 col2=5 but expected=8? No, row8 col3=5 expected 0), leaving open 0's filled instead of staying 0. Bottom 2's in row8-9 col12-13 stay 2 in generated but expected painted? Unknown why—perhaps touches_bottom misses them (i=7,8 < n-3=15? n=18, n-3=15, so i=7<15 misses). Flood overfills enclosed/open distinction.
 * For train2 (bg=9): Generated paints almost entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., top row all 3's but expected mostly 9's with some 5/3), treating bg=9 as object and flooding everything; no preservation of bg or correct components (e.g., expected keeps 9's as bg, paints specific 3/4/6/7 areas differently). Color groups wrong—9 should not be in "greens."
 * For train3 (bg=7? Expected shows 7 as bg): Generated uses 3 as pseudo-bg? (all borders 3, but paints inner to 5/3), but expected uses 7 as bg and selectively paints (e.g., row1 col2-3=3,3 expected but generated row1 all 3's; row4 col2=5 expected but generated=3; bottom row17-18=2,2 expected but generated all 3's). Overpaints bg and ignores correct visibility (e.g., some 1/6 components not painted right). Component extraction likely merges wrongly due to wrong target_vals.
 * extract_components is essential and seems correct (8-connected BFS works for blobs).
 * touches_bottom is partially helpful but broken for non-strict bottom (n-3 too loose, misses mid-bottom objects in train1).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is unhelpful/broken: Overfloods 0's to 5 without respecting enclosure (e.g., fills open spaces in train1 that should stay 0); seeds {1,3,5} too broad post-repaint.
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is helpful but misused: Called on original g after floods, but should integrate better (e.g., flood on updated out); in train1, it leaves some enclosed 0's unfilled wrongly.
 * Overall: No adaptation for varying bg (hardcodes greens/oranges assuming bg!= those); program ignores input colors like 5/7 properly in non-8 cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It floods massive border areas to 5 (e.g., entire top/bottom/left/right rows/columns are 5's, suggesting bg=5? But input not provided—assuming bg !=5, this overpaints bg/objects). Inner structures show partial logic (e.g., horizontal 3's in rows 2-3 cols2-22 look like a top-visible "green" bar painted to 3; vertical 4's in cols13-21 rows4-25 seem like orange components painted/kept? But mixed with 1's and 9's that should perhaps be repainted). However, large 5-flooded regions (e.g., rows 0-1 all 5's, right cols22-29 all 5's) likely wrongly fill open space instead of preserving 0's or bg; enclosed areas (e.g., potential holes in the 4/1/9 structures) may not be filled to 5 correctly, as some 1/9 persist inside. 9's appear in lower middle (rows12-15 cols13-15,21-23), suggesting unreached "greens" but if bg!=9, this mismatches. Without input, hard to confirm, but it doesn't match expected patterns from trains (e.g., should have more 0's for open space, selective 3/5 only on visible components); looks like overflooding similar to train failures, missing enclosure distinction and bg preservation. To handle test, need better bg-adaptive color groups (e.g., exclude bg from objects) and stricter visibility/flood rules.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to transform a colored grid by identifying the background, detecting connected components (blobs or objects) of non-background colors, preserving large or key structures (including potential holes), and selectively modifying small components based on their position relative to the grid's center, while leaving holes (often color 0) intact and applying specific color changes (e.g., to green=3 or orange=5) for certain small blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is reliably the most frequent color in the flattened grid; do not change it (e.g., no observed shifts from magenta to yellow in examples).
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); use bounding boxes (bbox) and positions to determine size, location (e.g., midpoint relative to grid center at n/2, m/2), and whether they are "large" (e.g., threshold like >20 or half the max size) or small—large ones must stay unchanged, including any with holes.
 * Holes appear as color 0 within objects; they should remain 0 (not filled with 5 or other colors), as seen in expected outputs where 0's persist in interiors while surrounding colors may change.
 * Small components (size < threshold) change color based on position: top (mid_r < center_r) often to 3 (green), left/bottom to 5 (orange), but only for non-hole, non-large blobs—subtle rule may involve quadrant or relative positioning, and not all small blobs change (e.g., some stay original if right/bottom).
 * No changes to numbers or representations within objects; preserve shapes but recolor small isolated blobs.
 * Components with holes (e.g., enclosed 0's) are treated as single units—do not modify internals unless specified; large holed components are unchanged.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, test 30x30); rules must scale without hardcoding.
 * Subtle: Some small blobs in bottom-left quadrants change to 3 in train1 expected (not 5), suggesting position rules may prioritize vertical over horizontal or have exceptions for certain colors/origins.
 * All non-background colors are considered for components, but bg=8/9/7/4 in examples—exclude bg from component search.
 * Potential for multiple components of same color; track individually by bbox/position.

```
(This is helpful and mostly correct; it accurately detects components, sizes, and bbox for positioning—essential for identifying small vs. large and locations. Use DFS/stack for efficiency on large grids like test 30x30.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3) and finds connected components via 4-connectivity, which works for blob detection.
 * change_small_components_based_on_position partially understands position-based recoloring (uses center and midpoints), but misapplies: fills holes (0) with 5 incorrectly (expected keeps 0's as holes); changes some small blobs to 3/5 but wrong ones (e.g., train1 generated swaps 5's and 0's in right-side holes, adds extra 5's where expected has 0's, and puts 3's only in bottom where expected has them but misses top/left specifics).
 * keep_large_holed_component_unchanged is a good idea but broken—does nothing useful, as it just copies grid; needs to explicitly detect/ preserve holed/large components (e.g., by checking enclosed 0's or size > threshold).
 * change_background_color is unhelpful and broken—does nothing but comments suggest irrelevant magenta-to-yellow change not seen in any examples (ignore/discard it).
 * program overall structure is helpful (bg -> components -> modify small -> output), but thresholds like size >20 or >= large/2 are arbitrary and fail: train1 large blob (e.g., the '8' shape) preserved but small holes filled wrong; train2 top blobs changed to 3/7 instead of expected 5/3/4 swaps; train3 left blobs partially preserved but small 3's/5's not recolored correctly (e.g., generated keeps some 3's as-is where expected changes to 5/2/6).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has 5's in hole positions (e.g., row3 col15=5 vs expected 0; row8 col11=0 missing); bottom blobs changed to 3's correctly in some spots but adds extra 5's; overall, too many changes to small/right components.
 * Train2 mismatches: top row1 has 3,7,7,3 vs expected 5,3,3,5 (wrong colors for small top/left blobs); row3 col13=3 vs expected 4; mid changes like row10 col4=5 vs expected 4 (fills wrong).
 * Train3 mismatches: row2 has 3's unchanged where expected changes some to 5; row4 col2=6 unchanged but expected 5; bottom row17/18 has 5's where expected 2's; misses hole preservation and position-specific changes (e.g., left small to 5, but generated keeps originals).
 * Function change_small_components_based_on_position is partially helpful for position logic but broken for holes/color rules (don't fill 0's; refine thresholds/conditions).
 * No attempt handles hole detection (e.g., count enclosed 0's in bbox); add to components dict for 'holes' to preserve large holed ones.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it arbitrarily changes small clusters of 1's, 3's, and 5's (e.g., top-mid 3's and 1's mostly preserved but some 1's in row5-8 changed to 4's? Wait, no—generated shows many original 1's/3's/5's intact but scatters 5's into positions like row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where input likely has different, and fills some apparent holes/spaces inconsistently.
 * It seems to apply position rules poorly: e.g., upper-left 3's/1's partially changed (row3-4 col2-5=3's kept, but row16-18 bottom 5's added where input has 5's already?); lower-right 1's/3's modified to 4's in scattered ways, but without clear quadrant logic—looks like over-changing small components without preserving shapes/holes (e.g., row22 col20-21=1,1 added/changed vs input).
 * Missing key: no evident hole preservation (if input has 0's, likely filled); changes don't align with train patterns (e.g., no consistent top-to-3 or left-to-5); overall, output looks like noisy recoloring rather than structured puzzle solution—probably wrong because it fails on similar position/size logic as trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or "tiles" of the same color) must be identified and selectively recolored based on structural rules like size, position, adjacency to background, and relationships to larger elements (e.g., a "frame"). The goal is to transform an input grid into a target output by applying color changes (e.g., to 3/green or 5/orange) to specific small components while leaving others unchanged, with the background color (often 8, 9, 7, or 4) remaining dominant.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; the code uses these directions but adds diagonals in some checks, which may overcount adjacency).
 * Small tiles are defined narrowly (≤4 pixels, bounding box ≤2x2), but this may miss some targets if they are slightly larger or irregularly shaped; expected outputs show small groups (1-4 pixels) being recolored, but not all.
 * A "large frame" is hypothesized as a big enclosing component (19-86 pixels, span 10-15), but this criterion fails to consistently identify the relevant structure across examples—e.g., in Train 1, the frame seems vertical/horizontal borders, but the rule doesn't trigger correctly.
 * Overlap with frame: Only changes small tiles of the same color as the frame if overlap ≥0.5, but this doesn't match expectations (e.g., Train 1 expects some 0s and 1s to stay or change differently, not to 5).
 * Lower position: Tiles in the bottom half (center_y ≥ n/2) that are adjacent to background (including diagonals) and not frame-colored change to 3, but this over-applies (e.g., Train 1 generates extra 3s in bottom where expected has 5s or 0s) and misses upper placements.
 * Zero-filling: Small 0-components adjacent to background change to 5, but this interacts poorly with other rules (applied after, so overrides might miss cases).
 * Background is top-left cell, assumed uniform, but grids have consistent borders (e.g., 8 in Train 1, 9 in Train 2).
 * Order of rules matters: Overlap first, then lower position, then zeros— but this sequence causes cascading errors (e.g., a tile changed to 5 early skips green rule).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes diagonals in some checks, but may not for component finding; zeros (0) are treated specially but may represent "empty" small tiles needing context-specific colors; not all small tiles change—some stay original (e.g., 1s, 2s in expectations); large components (e.g., frames) must not be altered; grids are square (18x18, 15x15, 20x20), but test is 30x30—scale rules accordingly.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected changes are to 5 in upper areas (not just lower), suggesting position rule is inverted or conditional; Train 3 shows symmetric changes (e.g., 1s to nothing, but 3s expand); colors like 1,2,6 may be "noise" or fixed; no rule for propagating colors between similar components.
 * All rules assume one large frame, but examples may have multiple large structures or none; pixel counts and bbox spans are heuristics that don't fit all (e.g., Train 2's frame seems irregular).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it fails all three training examples by applying incorrect color changes based on flawed rule heuristics.
 * Train 1: Generated changes several upper small tiles (e.g., positions around row 2-3, col 7-10 from 0/8 to 5; row 3 col 14-15 from 8 to 5) where expected keeps 0s or changes to other colors; bottom greens (3s) are placed too broadly (e.g., row 9-15 col 3-4 are 3s, but expected has 1s there initially changing differently); zeros filled to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 3 col 9 stays 0 in expected but becomes 5? Wait, no—generated has 0s in places expected has 5s, like row 3 col 16); overall, too many 5s in mid-upper, missing 5s in right column (e.g., row 3-9 col 16 expected 5, generated 0/8).
 * Train 2: Generated keeps some 7s as 3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 col 7-8 to nothing, but expected 5/3; row 7 col 7-8 stay 3 but expected 7); changes bottom 3s too early (row 9-14 col 2-3 to 3, expected 7/4); misses frame overlap (e.g., left frame 4s not propagating to 5); small tiles like row 0 col 6-9 expected 5/3 but generated 4/7; unknown why adjacency rule skips some lower 7s to 3 when expected keeps them.
 * Train 3: Generated fails to change upper 1s/6s to 5/3 (e.g., row 1 col 2-3 stay 1, expected 3; row 8-9 col 1-2 stay 6/5? Expected has 5s expanding left); bottom 3s over-applied (row 10-16 col 7-8 to 3/1, but expected 1/6); frame (background 7) adjacency changes zeros/ smalls wrong (no zeros here, but small 1s/2s not recolored correctly); misses symmetric left-side changes (e.g., row 7-10 col 1 to 5 in expected, generated 6).
 * Rule_orange_from_frame_overlap is broken/not helpful: Triggers too few/often on wrong color matches, missing cases where non-same-color tiles need orange.
 * Rule_green_from_lower_position over-applies to non-adjacent tiles and skips upper ones that need green/orange.
 * Rule_fill_small_zeros helps partially (fills some 0s to 5 adjacent to bg), but interacts badly (e.g., Train 1 fills upper 0s to 5 where expected keeps 0 or changes later).
 * Rule_stabilize_large_frame is unhelpful/irrelevant: Does nothing, but large components need protection—consider expanding to avoid any large changes.
 * Find_large_frame is flawed: Pixel/span ranges don't capture irregular frames (e.g., Train 3's vertical bars not 10-15 span); may return None, skipping rules.
 * Overall, component extraction works (find_components correctly identifies blobs), but rule logic demonstrates poor understanding—changes don't align with patterns like "fill gaps in frames" or "color based on enclosure."

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It appears to copy the input almost unchanged (e.g., all 1s, 9s, 0s stay as-is, no recoloring observed in the printed grid), suggesting rules failed to trigger (e.g., no 3s or 5s added, despite small 0s/1s tiles present like row 8 col 6-8 0s adjacent to 4 bg; upper 9s/1s not changed to frame-like 5). This mismatches puzzle intent, as trainings show small tiles (e.g., 0s,1s) should recolor to 3/5 based on position/adjacency—here, lower 0s (row 19-21 col 21-23) stay 0, upper 1s stay 1. Likely, large_frame detection fails on the 30x30 scale (borders are 4, but inner structures like horizontal 9s/1s bars may not fit 19-86 pixels), and small_tile filter misses some (e.g., the 7-pixel 1s in row 2-4 col 5-11). No changes mean the program didn't apply rules effectively, making output senseless for the puzzle—expect more 5s in frame-overlaps (e.g., inner 1s bars) and 3s in lower isolated tiles.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

(These are helpful for edge visibility checks, but has_right_visible may need fixing to not special-case 1.)

    m = len(g[0])
    for i, j in component:
        if i == n - 1 or (i == n - 2 and 0 <= j < m and g[i + 1][j] == bg):

    return False

def touches_left(component: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, m: int) -> bool:

        if j == 0 or (j == 1 and 0 <= i < n and g[i][0] == bg):
            return True
    return False
```
(These are helpful for special case edge-touching, using adjacency to bg.)

```python
def flood_fill_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])
    queue = collections.deque()
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    seeds = {1, 3, 5}
    # Enqueue initial adjacent 0s from seeds
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0:
                        out[ni][nj] = 5
                        queue.append((ni, nj))
    # Propagate
    while queue:
        i, j = queue.popleft()
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni = i + di
            nj = j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0:
                out[ni][nj] = 5
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed **across EVERY puzzle** (i.e., present in Train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties like color, position (bbox), size (pixels), and holes that show reliable cause-effect or linkage between input and output elements. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., unchanged large fills without interaction) are excluded. Inconsistent changes (e.g., addition of entirely new components, as seen only in Train 1) are not listed. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained from the data (e.g., exact trigger for specific color shifts), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Small accent components (pixels ≤ 4, holes = 0) interact with their position (bbox) relative to structural elements, resulting in color transformation**:
   - Input small accents (colors: Red, Blue, Dark Red, Yellow, Pink) consistently change color in the output to either Green or Orange, while bbox, pixels, and holes remain identical.
   - Examples across all trains:
     - Train 1: Red ([10,13,11,14], pixels=4) → Green; Red ([4,14,5,15], pixels=4) → Green.
     - Train 2: Dark Red ([7,0,8,1], pixels=4) → Green; Dark Red ([3,1,4,2], pixels=4) → Green; Yellow ([6,0,6,0], pixels=1) → Orange; Yellow ([5,1,5,1], pixels=1) → Orange.
     - Train 3: Blue ([2,1,3,2], pixels=4) → Green; Pink ([4,1,9,1], pixels=6, but effectively small/compact) → Orange; Pink ([10,2,13,2], pixels=4) → Orange.
   - Connection: Position (bbox coordinates) links the component to the fixed structural lines/background (e.g., adjacency or overlap with large Maroon/Dark Red/Light Blue blobs), triggering the color change. Not all small accents change (e.g., some Blues/Pinks/Yellows stay the same), so the exact positional rule (e.g., specific x/y thresholds or proximity distance) is unknown.
   - No movement or size alteration; purely color effect.

2. **Structural line components (pixels > 4, no holes or holes > 0) remain unchanged, serving as fixed interactors for small accents**:
   - Large components (e.g., Maroon [3,2,9,14] pixels=59 in Train 1; Light Blue [0,3,12,14] holes=4 pixels=74 in Train 2; Dark Red [2,2,13,16] pixels=86 in Train 3) show identical color, bbox, pixels, and holes in input and output.
   - Connection: These act as static "anchors" that small accents interact with via position (e.g., bbox overlap or edge adjacency), but without altering the structural components themselves. This interaction is consistent as the trigger for small accent color changes (per item 1), but the structural lines do not transform or propagate changes outward.
   - Background canvases (large hole-bearing components like Maroon holes=8 in Train 1, Light Blue holes=4 in Train 2, Dark Red holes=1 in Train 3) follow the same unchanged pattern, reinforcing positional stability for interactions.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., hole count affecting color, silhouette/edge properties influencing movement, or cross-component color propagation) are observable across all examples, as they either vary (e.g., only Train 1 adds new small Oranges potentially linked to unknown position-based creation) or lack evidence in the data (e.g., no consistent bbox shifts or pixel count changes). Transformations like "Red/Dark Red/Blue → Green" vs. "Yellow/Pink → Orange" appear pattern-like but are not fully consistent (e.g., not all instances follow, and positions vary), so the precise color-to-color mapping rule is unknown.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 09:18:47] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs/objects) of specific colors in a background grid, evaluate their visibility from edges (top, left, right, bottom), and transform them to new colors (e.g., 3 or 5) based on shape ratios (width vs height), visibility conditions, and background-specific rules, before performing a flood fill from certain seed values (odd numbers like 1,3,5,7,9) to fill empty (0) spaces with 5, likely simulating some kind of object occlusion or rendering in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals) groups of the same non-background, non-zero value; empty spaces are 0.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0]; exclude bg from consideration for changes, and visibility checks ignore bg and 0.
 * For "green" colors (1,7,9 if not bg): Change to 3 if top-visible and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)).
 * For "orange" colors (4,6 if not bg): Change to 5 if (top or left visible) and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)); subtle: this seems to target horizontal-ish bars or protrusions.
 * Special case if bg==8: Change 2-components to 3 if bottom-visible (perhaps shadows or ground-level objects).
 * Flood fill: Starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9}, spreads to adjacent 0s (8 directions) filling with 5, but only if not visited; subtle: this might simulate filling hidden/empty areas behind visible objects, but it can overfill if seeds are misplaced.
 * Visibility: A component is "top-visible" if any cell has no non-bg/non-0 above it in the same column; similar for left (same row left), right (same row right), bottom (below).
 * Subtleties: Changes use a dict to avoid overwriting; components must be non-empty; shape ratio uses bounding box (min/max i/j +1 for h/w); easy to miss: visibility is per-cell then any in component, and changes only if do_change condition met; flood fill uses BFS but seeds include post-change values, so order matters (changes before fill); bg can be colors like 4,8,9 affecting which are "greens/oranges"; no diagonal-only connections—full 8-way; potential over-changing if multiple rules overlap; empty grid areas stay bg unless filled.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle variable grid sizes; ensure copy_grid preserves original; visited prevents re-flood; but flood seeds include 5 which might self-propagate if adjacent to 0; rules seem asymmetric (favor horizontal changes, right/bottom less prioritized); test inputs may have no 0s initially, so fill only creates if changes introduce them? No—changes replace to 3/5, fill only targets existing 0s; subtle miss: expected outputs have 0s where generated has 5/3, suggesting changes should introduce 0s or not fill certain areas.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

def extract_components(g: List[List[int]], target_val: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:

    # marking visited; returns list of lists of (i,j) positions per component. Accurate for blob extraction.

Note: get_size is basic/redundant; changes dict in main program is helpful for batched updates.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) passed Training example 3 (correct output matched), showing core component extraction, visibility, and flood fill work in some cases.
 * Failed Training 1: Generated filled areas with 5 and changed to 3 where expected has 0s and 2/5; specifically, upper blob (likely 2?) changed incorrectly to 3/5 instead of keeping/changing to 2 with 0s for hidden parts; flood fill over-applied 5 to what should be 0s; bottom 3s correct, but side 1s unchanged correctly; unknown why 2 not handled as special (bg=8 rule applied but wrong visibility?).
 * Failed Training 2: Generated kept some 5/3 but misplaced 4/6 vs expected (e.g., row 5 col 1-2: generated 5,5 expected 4,6; row 12 col 5: generated 4 expected 4 but surrounding mismatches); changes to 5/3 over-applied to vertical-ish components; flood fill didn't create 0s, but expected has no 0s—issue is wrong color swaps (e.g., 6s became 5?); bg=9, so greens=1,7 but input has 3,5,6,4,7—3 not changed, but oranges=4,6 changed wrong.
 * extract_components is essential and correct (used successfully in the correct example 3).
 * Visibility functions are helpful but subtle bug: they check per-cell but return if ANY visible, which is correct, but in train1, top_vis likely true but do_change wrong for vertical blobs.
 * Flood fill is mostly helpful but unhelpful in cases with no 0s (does nothing, correct) or overfills post-change seeds; in train1, it filled what should be 0s (perhaps changes didn't introduce 0s, but expected has them—suggests rule should set some to 0 instead of 3/5).
 * Changes dict avoids overlaps, helpful; greens/oranges filtering by !=bg is key but missed if bg in list (e.g., train2 bg=9 not in lists).
 * Overall: Partial rules for horizontal changes work (why example 3 passed), but vertical/square components not distinguished well; special bg=8 rule applied in train1 but wrong (changed 2 to 3, but expected kept 2 with 0s); no handling for keeping 0s or other colors like 2/5 unchanged.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have minimally changed the input (kept most 1,3,5,9 components as-is or swapped some 1/9 to 3 under rules), with no 0s introduced and flood fill doing nothing (since no 0s in input and changes don't create them), resulting in a grid full of 4(bg),1,3,5,9 without occlusions or empties.
 * Expected likely includes 0s in hidden areas (e.g., behind vertical 1s or 9s, similar to train1 where 0s represent occluded space), and possibly more changes to 5 for oranges (but bg=4, so oranges=6 only if present—input has none?); e.g., the large horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 stayed 3 (correct if not green), but vertical 9s in col 21-23 rows 5-20 probably should be partially 0 or changed if not top-visible; side 5s in row8 col6-8 stayed, but if left-visible and wide, should be 5? Wait, already 5; overall, lacks 0s where components overlap shadows, and flood fill missed because no seeds hit 0s—suggests rules need to set some component parts to 0 for depth/occlusion, not just color swap; unknown exact diffs without input grid, but output looks too "filled" vs expected sparse 0s in trains.

[2025-10-03 09:18:55] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnections and Interactions Across All Train Examples

After comparing the input-output pairs in all three train examples, below is a list of **only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections** between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically in **every** train pair (1, 2, and 3). I ignored any non-consistent changes (e.g., additions only in train 1, position-specific variations that differ across examples, or transformations that aren't uniform). No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., large background-like components with holes >0, unchanged elements, or isolated small pixels without clear ties) are included. Where a transformation lacks a clear, consistent explanation (e.g., why only specific instances change), it is noted as unknown.

- **2x2 square blocks (pixels=4, holes=0, bbox span of 1 unit in both x and y dimensions) → Color change to Green**: In every example, specific instances of these compact square blocks (regardless of original color, such as Red, Dark Red, or Blue) have their color uniformly transformed to Green. The interaction is between the block's shape properties (fixed size/pixels/holes) and an unknown positional or structural factor (e.g., attachment to paths or ends), as not all such blocks change—only a subset does consistently. Unchanged 2x2 blocks (e.g., middle-positioned ones) show no interaction.
  
- **Small linear or single-pixel elements (pixels=1–6, holes=0, bbox indicating thin/horizontal/vertical extension, original color matching apparent background like Yellow, Pink, or implied purple/Maroon fragments) → Color change to Orange**: In every example, these thin or point-like elements (often 1–2 pixels wide, forming short segments) interact with their original color (background-associated) to change specifically to Orange. The connection ties the element's shape (linearity/thinness) and low pixel count to a color override, consistently across examples. The trigger for which exact ones change (vs. those that stay) is unknown, as it varies by position without a uniform rule.

No other interactions (e.g., hole count affecting color, position directly transforming shape, or interactions between specific colors like Blue and Red) are consistent across all three examples. Large elements (e.g., >10 pixels, holes >0) show no consistent changes or ties to smaller ones. Pixel counts and bbox positions do not have uniform effects (e.g., no consistent "bottom → Green" or "top → Orange" rule).

[2025-10-03 09:20:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where numbers represent colors or object types (e.g., 1,2,3,5 for different elements, 8/7/9/4 likely for borders or backgrounds), and zeros indicate empty spaces that may or may not need filling based on rules. The goal appears to be transforming the input grid by applying color mappings, completing shapes, or filling specific regions while preserving empties in certain areas, rather than a uniform fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Zeros (empty spaces) are not always filled; in expected outputs, some remain 0 (e.g., scattered empties inside shapes in training example 1), suggesting selective filling based on proximity to objects, containment, or pattern completion—uniform filling with 5 (orange) overwrites these and fails.
 * Existing numbers sometimes change values (e.g., in training example 1, bottom-right 2,2 pairs become 3,3 in expected, while top 2,2 stay 2,2; in example 2, some 7's become 3's and 4's become 5's), indicating rule-based recoloring, possibly mapping colors by object type, size, or position (e.g., symmetric or mirrored changes).
 * Background/border values (8 in ex1, 9 in ex2, 7 in ex3, 4 in test) remain unchanged, but inner regions show pattern extensions or fills (e.g., in ex1, new 3,3 blocks appear where input might have had partials or empties; in ex3, 1,1 and 6,6 extend into 5's or 3's).
 * Shapes seem to be "objects" like blobs or lines (e.g., pairs of 1's, 2's, 6's), which may need extraction for analysis—rules could involve counting connected components, filling enclosed areas, or applying color swaps based on global patterns (e.g., orange 5 fills some but not all voids).
 * Subtle: Outputs maintain grid structure but alter internals; empties near borders or outside shapes stay 0, while those inside get filled (but not always with 5—e.g., ex1 has 0's inside what looks like a frame). Possible symmetry or mirroring (e.g., ex1 has mirrored 1,1 and 2,2 placements). Avoid over-filling, as it breaks expected 0 preservation. Consider object adjacency or flooding from seeds.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): No object extraction, so misses identifying regions; uniform fill ignores why some 0's stay (e.g., non-contiguous empties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid without modification—useful as a base for safe transformations."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Extract positions of connected regions (e.g., blobs of same number) using flood-fill; helpful for identifying objects to recolor or fill around.
    Assumes 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right). Returns list of (i,j) positions."""
    if g[start_i][start_j] != target_val:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    component = []
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == target_val:
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```

(Note: No other functions from the attempt are helpful; `fill_zeros_with_orange` is broken as it uniformly fills all 0's, ignoring selective rules, and should not be reused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly copies the grid and fills all 0's with 5 (orange), which works for preserving non-zero values and borders but fails entirely on selective filling—e.g., in train1, it turns expected internal 0's (like row2 col7=0) into 5's, but expected keeps them 0; also mismatches recoloring (e.g., row14 col10-11=2,2 becomes 3,3 in expected, but attempt leaves as 2,2).
 * In train1, generated has extra 5's in places like row3 col6=5 (expected 0), and bottom 2,2 unchanged where expected has 3,3—difference unknown but likely due to missing color mapping for specific object types (e.g., bottom blobs are a different "color" class).
 * In train2, generated leaves some values like 7's and 4's unchanged (e.g., row1 col7-8=7,7 becomes 3,3 in expected), filling 0's with 5's incorrectly (e.g., row1 col6=5 in expected but was 0? Wait, input not shown, but output shows mismatches like row0 col6=4 in generated vs 5 in expected)—indicates no recoloring logic.
 * In train3, generated keeps 1's as 1's and 6's as 6's (e.g., row1 col2-3=1,1 unchanged, but expected has 3,3), and fills 0's with 5's where expected extends patterns differently (e.g., row2 col10-13=6,6,6,6 becomes 5,5,5,5)—suggests missing blob extension or type-based filling.
 * No extraction of objects, so can't identify why some regions (e.g., enclosed 0's) get filled vs. others stay empty; uniform approach misses all subtleties like color swaps (2->3, 1->3? patterns).
 * `fill_zeros_with_orange` is unhelpful/broken: it over-fills and ignores recoloring, leading to all training failures; do not reuse without conditions (e.g., only fill if adjacent to certain objects).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of the input with 0's filled as 5's (e.g., row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where likely 0's were), but preserves input numbers like 9's,1's, and a single 5, while borders are 4's unchanged. This mismatches the pattern from training, where outputs involve recoloring (e.g., no 2->3-like changes here, and scattered 0's should likely remain in non-shape areas like inside the 9/1 frames). It looks incorrect because it doesn't complete or alter shapes (e.g., the 1,1 pairs and 9 blocks seem unextended, unlike train1's 3,3 additions); instead, it's just a lazy fill, ignoring why train examples needed specific changes. To fix, need rules for object detection (e.g., treat 1's as one type to extend/fill around) and handle larger grid (30 cols) with possible symmetry in the 9/1/5 regions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids containing various numbers (representing colors or components like 0 for empty, 1 for blue, 2 for something else, etc.) are modified according to specific rules to produce output grids, likely involving selective filling of empties (0s) with orange (5), conditional color changes (e.g., blue 1 to green 3 in some areas), and preserving structural elements (e.g., backgrounds like 8, 9, 7, 4). The goal is to identify patterns from training examples, such as connected components or regions, to apply transformations only where rules match, rather than globally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Not all empty spaces (0s) are filled with orange (5); in train example 1 expected output, many 0s remain unfilled (e.g., positions like row 1 col 7 is 0, row 3 col 5 is 0), suggesting filling is selective, possibly only in certain connected regions, bounded areas, or non-structural empties, while others (e.g., in outlines or specific shapes) stay 0 to maintain transparency or separation.
 * Blue (1) changes to green (3) are not universal; in train example 1 expected, some 1s remain 1 (e.g., row 1-2 col 15-16 are 1s), while others become 3 (e.g., row 14-15 col 4-5 are 3s, possibly from original 1s or other colors); this implies changes based on connectivity, enclosure, or adjacency to other elements like 2s or 5s, not blanket replacement.
 * Structural backgrounds (e.g., 8 in train 1, 9/4/7 in train 2, 7 in train 3) are preserved unchanged, but some non-background elements like 7s in train 2 are transformed to 3s or 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9 expected 3s vs. generated 7s), indicating rules distinguish between fixed structures and mutable components, possibly via flood-fill or component detection.
 * In train example 3 expected, some areas get 5s (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 expected 3,3 but with 5s in row 2 col 10-13), and 1s appear in places like row 7 col 10-11, suggesting introductions of new colors (1 or 5) in enclosed or adjacent regions, and selective filling of 0s only in specific blobs (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 has 5s where generated has 3s incorrectly).
 * Subtle element: Transformations may involve "components" (connected groups of same-number cells, 4- or 8-connected), as hinted in the attempt's docstring; e.g., in train 1, blue components near certain shapes change, but isolated ones don't—need to detect and classify components by size, shape, or enclosure.
 * Across examples, 2s (possibly red or objects) remain unchanged, 5s (orange) are added selectively, and greens (3) replace blues (1) or other colors (like 7s in train 2) only in "interior" or bounded areas; empties in "exteriors" or outlines stay 0.
 * Potential oversight: Rules might prioritize "filling holes" in objects (e.g., enclosed 0s become 5), changing colors based on surrounding structures (e.g., 1 inside a 2-shape becomes 3), and no global changes—requires spatial analysis like bounding boxes or adjacency checks.
 * All training outputs are incorrect, showing over-application: generated fills EVERY 0 to 5 (but expected keeps many 0s) and changes EVERY 1 to 3 (but expected keeps some 1s and changes others conditionally).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No truly helpful functions were provided in this attempt; the existing ones are overly simplistic and broken for the puzzle:
```python
# This function is broken: It fills ALL 0s indiscriminately, but puzzle requires selective filling (e.g., only enclosed or specific regions). Not helpful—avoid in future.
def fill_empty_spaces_with_orange(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 0:
                new_g[i][j] = 5
    return new_g
```
```python
# This function is broken: Changes ALL 1s to 3s, but some 1s must remain (e.g., train 1 top-right). Not helpful without component detection—avoid or modify to target specific connected 1-groups.
def change_blue_components_to_green(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 1:
                new_g[i][j] = 3
    return new_g
```
```python
# This is a no-op (identity function), which is correct for preserving structures but unhelpful alone—puzzle needs it combined with conditional logic.
def keep_structural_elements_unchanged(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
Future attempts should include tools like:
```python
# Suggested: Detect connected components (e.g., using flood-fill) to classify regions for selective changes.
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Basic flood-fill to get positions of connected cells with target_val; return set of (i,j) for analysis (e.g., size, enclosure).
    # Implementation omitted for brevity, but essential for identifying "components" mentioned in attempt docstrings.
    pass
```
```python
# Suggested: Check if a region is "enclosed" (e.g., surrounded by non-0/non-target walls) to decide filling or color change.
def is_enclosed(g: List[List[int]], component_positions: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    # Analyze bounding box or adjacency to background (e.g., 8/9/7/4); true if no path to edge.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) blindly fills all 0s with 5 and all 1s with 3, ignoring selectivity—resulting in train 1 generated having extra 5s where expected has 0s (e.g., row 1 col 7: generated 5 vs. expected 0; row 3 col 5: 5 vs. 0) and extra 3s where expected has 1s (e.g., row 1 col 15-16: 3 vs. 1), and missing new 3s in bottom (e.g., row 14 col 4-5: generated 2? wait, actually 3 from change, but positions mismatch overall).
 * Train 2 mismatches heavily: generated keeps 7s and 4s unchanged where expected changes to 3s and 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9: generated 7,7 vs. expected 3,3; row 0 col 6 and 9: 4 vs. 5), and no 0-filling needed here but over-applies if any 0s present—suggests 7s or other colors change conditionally to 3/5, not just 1s.
 * Train 3 mismatches: generated changes 1s? but expected introduces 5s in places like row 2 col 2-3 (generated 3 vs. expected 5? wait, row 2: generated 3,3,7,...5,5,... but expected 3,3,7,...5,5,... wait, partial match but row 3 col 2: generated 6 vs. expected 5; and adds 1s in row 7-8 col 10-11 expected but generated likely 3 if 1s present, or unchanged—unknown input but shows over-changing.
 * Missed core: No component extraction or enclosure checks, leading to global ops instead of rule-based (e.g., fill enclosed 0s, change interior 1s).
 * The "keep_structural_elements_unchanged" is correct in intent but trivial/unhelpful without integration.
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, which is essential for subtleties like connected blues or holes—future needs flood-fill or similar.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding (e.g., orange for empties, green for blues, preserve structures) but fails execution due to lack of conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same global rules (fill 0s to 5, 1s to 3), resulting in widespread 5s (e.g., row 8 col 6-8: 5,5,5 likely from 0s) and 3s preserved/changed (e.g., many 3s in rows 2-4 and 12-15, possibly original or from 1s), but given training failures, this likely over-fills empties (e.g., scattered 5s in row 8-9 may be where expected keeps 0s or other values) and incorrectly changes components (e.g., bottom rows have 5s in row 20-21 col 21-23, which might be selective in expected but global here).
 * It mismatches puzzle subtleties: e.g., dense 4-background preserved (good), but 3-clusters in top/mid (rows 2-4 col 5-12 and 20-23) seem unchanged, yet if input had 1s there, changing all would be wrong per train 1; scattered 5s (e.g., row 8 col 20-21: 3,3 but nearby 5s) suggest unfilled areas should remain 0 or get different treatment.
 * Does not make sense as final output—looks like a naive transformation without spatial rules, e.g., no evident selective filling for enclosed regions (test grid has complex shapes like 9-blobs and 3-lines, likely needing component-based changes); expected probably keeps some 0s (not shown, but inferred from trains) and conditional 1-to-3 or other swaps (e.g., some 9s or 4s to 5/3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where cells with numeric values (0-9) represent colors, empty space (0), or background, and the task is to identify connected components (likely 8-connected, including diagonals) of specific "object" colors, evaluate their visibility or positioning relative to borders (e.g., top, left, bottom), repaint them with target colors (often 3 or 5), perform flood fills on empty (0) areas from certain seeds or borders to distinguish enclosed vs. open spaces, and handle special cases based on the background color (e.g., bg=8 triggers unique rules). The output transforms the input grid into a segmented or labeled version, preserving background and non-objects while marking "visible" or "enclosed" regions appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), not just 4-connected, as the extraction uses all 8 directions; this is crucial for identifying blob-like objects that touch diagonally.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and it varies across examples (8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3); rules must adapt to bg, e.g., non-bg cells !=0 are potential objects, but 0 is empty/space to fill or flood.
 * Visibility checks: "Top visible" means at least one cell in the component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; "left visible" similarly checks left in the same row. These determine if an object is "exposed" from edges, triggering repaints (e.g., greens to 3 if top-visible, oranges to 5 if top- or left-visible).
 * Special case for bg=8: Only components of color 2 that "touch bottom" (any cell with row >= n-3) get painted to 3; this seems like a "grounded" or "falling" object rule, but the threshold (n-3) may be too loose or arbitrary.
 * Flood filling: Two types—(1) flood_from_seeds starts from cells with values in {1,3,5} and spreads to adjacent 0's (8 directions) with 5, but only marks visited 0's without fully propagating from new 5's in the queue (potential bug: it sets to 5 but queue only adds direct neighbors, not chaining fully? Wait, it does chain via while loop); (2) fill_enclosed_zeros floods from all border 0's (top/bottom/left/right edges) using BFS on 0's (8 directions), marks open/connected-to-border 0's as visited, then paints remaining (enclosed) 0's to 5. This distinguishes holes/ enclosed spaces from outer space.
 * Color groups: "Greens" [1,7,9] painted to 3 if top-visible (perhaps "sky" or "falling from top" objects); "oranges" [4,6] to 5 if top- or left-visible (side-exposed). But in train2 (bg=9), 9 is treated as green but is actually bg in expected, causing overpainting. 2's handled specially only for bg=8.
 * Subtleties: Do not paint bg itself (e.g., in train2, 9 stays 9); 0's on borders are "open" and stay 0 if not enclosed, but enclosed 0's become 5. Components must ignore bg and 0 in connectivity. Bottom-touch in bg=8 uses a fixed offset (n-3), which might miss if grid size varies or "bottom" means stricter (e.g., i == n-1). Flood seeds {1,3,5} suggest painting after initial repaints to propagate "influence." Diagonal connectivity can merge objects unexpectedly. In train1, some 0's stay 0 in expected (open spaces), but generated fills them wrongly. No handling for other colors (e.g., 5 in input?).
 * Easy-to-miss: After repainting components, re-run floods on the updated grid (out), as new 3/5 can seed further fills. But in code, flood_from_seeds runs before fill_enclosed_zeros, which uses original g for flooding (bug: should use out?). Visited in floods must reset per call. For bg!=8, no bottom-touch logic, but train3 suggests similar positioning rules for other colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it fails all training examples due to incorrect color grouping and overpainting (e.g., treats input 9 as "green" object in train2, but 9 is bg and should stay unchanged).
 * For train1 (bg=8): Generated correctly paints some bottom 2's to 3 (e.g., row14 col4-5, row15 col4-5 match expected), and some 5's on right (e.g., row3 col16-17), but wrongly paints extra 3's (row13 col10-11 as 3,3 but expected 3,3? Wait, row13 expected has 3,3 at col10-11? No—generated has 3,3 there but expected has them lower; actually, generated fills too many 0's to 5 (e.g., row3 col14=5 but expected=0; row6 col2=5 but expected=0; row8 col2=5 but expected=8? No, row8 col3=5 expected 0), leaving open 0's filled instead of staying 0. Bottom 2's in row8-9 col12-13 stay 2 in generated but expected painted? Unknown why—perhaps touches_bottom misses them (i=7,8 < n-3=15? n=18, n-3=15, so i=7<15 misses). Flood overfills enclosed/open distinction.
 * For train2 (bg=9): Generated paints almost entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., top row all 3's but expected mostly 9's with some 5/3), treating bg=9 as object and flooding everything; no preservation of bg or correct components (e.g., expected keeps 9's as bg, paints specific 3/4/6/7 areas differently). Color groups wrong—9 should not be in "greens."
 * For train3 (bg=7? Expected shows 7 as bg): Generated uses 3 as pseudo-bg? (all borders 3, but paints inner to 5/3), but expected uses 7 as bg and selectively paints (e.g., row1 col2-3=3,3 expected but generated row1 all 3's; row4 col2=5 expected but generated=3; bottom row17-18=2,2 expected but generated all 3's). Overpaints bg and ignores correct visibility (e.g., some 1/6 components not painted right). Component extraction likely merges wrongly due to wrong target_vals.
 * extract_components is essential and seems correct (8-connected BFS works for blobs).
 * touches_bottom is partially helpful but broken for non-strict bottom (n-3 too loose, misses mid-bottom objects in train1).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is unhelpful/broken: Overfloods 0's to 5 without respecting enclosure (e.g., fills open spaces in train1 that should stay 0); seeds {1,3,5} too broad post-repaint.
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is helpful but misused: Called on original g after floods, but should integrate better (e.g., flood on updated out); in train1, it leaves some enclosed 0's unfilled wrongly.
 * Overall: No adaptation for varying bg (hardcodes greens/oranges assuming bg!= those); program ignores input colors like 5/7 properly in non-8 cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It floods massive border areas to 5 (e.g., entire top/bottom/left/right rows/columns are 5's, suggesting bg=5? But input not provided—assuming bg !=5, this overpaints bg/objects). Inner structures show partial logic (e.g., horizontal 3's in rows 2-3 cols2-22 look like a top-visible "green" bar painted to 3; vertical 4's in cols13-21 rows4-25 seem like orange components painted/kept? But mixed with 1's and 9's that should perhaps be repainted). However, large 5-flooded regions (e.g., rows 0-1 all 5's, right cols22-29 all 5's) likely wrongly fill open space instead of preserving 0's or bg; enclosed areas (e.g., potential holes in the 4/1/9 structures) may not be filled to 5 correctly, as some 1/9 persist inside. 9's appear in lower middle (rows12-15 cols13-15,21-23), suggesting unreached "greens" but if bg!=9, this mismatches. Without input, hard to confirm, but it doesn't match expected patterns from trains (e.g., should have more 0's for open space, selective 3/5 only on visible components); looks like overflooding similar to train failures, missing enclosure distinction and bg preservation. To handle test, need better bg-adaptive color groups (e.g., exclude bg from objects) and stricter visibility/flood rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to transform a colored grid by identifying the background, detecting connected components (blobs or objects) of non-background colors, preserving large or key structures (including potential holes), and selectively modifying small components based on their position relative to the grid's center, while leaving holes (often color 0) intact and applying specific color changes (e.g., to green=3 or orange=5) for certain small blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is reliably the most frequent color in the flattened grid; do not change it (e.g., no observed shifts from magenta to yellow in examples).
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); use bounding boxes (bbox) and positions to determine size, location (e.g., midpoint relative to grid center at n/2, m/2), and whether they are "large" (e.g., threshold like >20 or half the max size) or small—large ones must stay unchanged, including any with holes.
 * Holes appear as color 0 within objects; they should remain 0 (not filled with 5 or other colors), as seen in expected outputs where 0's persist in interiors while surrounding colors may change.
 * Small components (size < threshold) change color based on position: top (mid_r < center_r) often to 3 (green), left/bottom to 5 (orange), but only for non-hole, non-large blobs—subtle rule may involve quadrant or relative positioning, and not all small blobs change (e.g., some stay original if right/bottom).
 * No changes to numbers or representations within objects; preserve shapes but recolor small isolated blobs.
 * Components with holes (e.g., enclosed 0's) are treated as single units—do not modify internals unless specified; large holed components are unchanged.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, test 30x30); rules must scale without hardcoding.
 * Subtle: Some small blobs in bottom-left quadrants change to 3 in train1 expected (not 5), suggesting position rules may prioritize vertical over horizontal or have exceptions for certain colors/origins.
 * All non-background colors are considered for components, but bg=8/9/7/4 in examples—exclude bg from component search.
 * Potential for multiple components of same color; track individually by bbox/position.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for all examples; use it to exclude bg from component detection.)

                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:

    return components
```
(This is helpful and mostly correct; it accurately detects components, sizes, and bbox for positioning—essential for identifying small vs. large and locations. Use DFS/stack for efficiency on large grids like test 30x30.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3) and finds connected components via 4-connectivity, which works for blob detection.
 * change_small_components_based_on_position partially understands position-based recoloring (uses center and midpoints), but misapplies: fills holes (0) with 5 incorrectly (expected keeps 0's as holes); changes some small blobs to 3/5 but wrong ones (e.g., train1 generated swaps 5's and 0's in right-side holes, adds extra 5's where expected has 0's, and puts 3's only in bottom where expected has them but misses top/left specifics).
 * keep_large_holed_component_unchanged is a good idea but broken—does nothing useful, as it just copies grid; needs to explicitly detect/ preserve holed/large components (e.g., by checking enclosed 0's or size > threshold).
 * change_background_color is unhelpful and broken—does nothing but comments suggest irrelevant magenta-to-yellow change not seen in any examples (ignore/discard it).
 * program overall structure is helpful (bg -> components -> modify small -> output), but thresholds like size >20 or >= large/2 are arbitrary and fail: train1 large blob (e.g., the '8' shape) preserved but small holes filled wrong; train2 top blobs changed to 3/7 instead of expected 5/3/4 swaps; train3 left blobs partially preserved but small 3's/5's not recolored correctly (e.g., generated keeps some 3's as-is where expected changes to 5/2/6).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has 5's in hole positions (e.g., row3 col15=5 vs expected 0; row8 col11=0 missing); bottom blobs changed to 3's correctly in some spots but adds extra 5's; overall, too many changes to small/right components.
 * Train2 mismatches: top row1 has 3,7,7,3 vs expected 5,3,3,5 (wrong colors for small top/left blobs); row3 col13=3 vs expected 4; mid changes like row10 col4=5 vs expected 4 (fills wrong).
 * Train3 mismatches: row2 has 3's unchanged where expected changes some to 5; row4 col2=6 unchanged but expected 5; bottom row17/18 has 5's where expected 2's; misses hole preservation and position-specific changes (e.g., left small to 5, but generated keeps originals).
 * Function change_small_components_based_on_position is partially helpful for position logic but broken for holes/color rules (don't fill 0's; refine thresholds/conditions).
 * No attempt handles hole detection (e.g., count enclosed 0's in bbox); add to components dict for 'holes' to preserve large holed ones.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it arbitrarily changes small clusters of 1's, 3's, and 5's (e.g., top-mid 3's and 1's mostly preserved but some 1's in row5-8 changed to 4's? Wait, no—generated shows many original 1's/3's/5's intact but scatters 5's into positions like row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where input likely has different, and fills some apparent holes/spaces inconsistently.
 * It seems to apply position rules poorly: e.g., upper-left 3's/1's partially changed (row3-4 col2-5=3's kept, but row16-18 bottom 5's added where input has 5's already?); lower-right 1's/3's modified to 4's in scattered ways, but without clear quadrant logic—looks like over-changing small components without preserving shapes/holes (e.g., row22 col20-21=1,1 added/changed vs input).
 * Missing key: no evident hole preservation (if input has 0's, likely filled); changes don't align with train patterns (e.g., no consistent top-to-3 or left-to-5); overall, output looks like noisy recoloring rather than structured puzzle solution—probably wrong because it fails on similar position/size logic as trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or "tiles" of the same color) must be identified and selectively recolored based on structural rules like size, position, adjacency to background, and relationships to larger elements (e.g., a "frame"). The goal is to transform an input grid into a target output by applying color changes (e.g., to 3/green or 5/orange) to specific small components while leaving others unchanged, with the background color (often 8, 9, 7, or 4) remaining dominant.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; the code uses these directions but adds diagonals in some checks, which may overcount adjacency).
 * Small tiles are defined narrowly (≤4 pixels, bounding box ≤2x2), but this may miss some targets if they are slightly larger or irregularly shaped; expected outputs show small groups (1-4 pixels) being recolored, but not all.
 * A "large frame" is hypothesized as a big enclosing component (19-86 pixels, span 10-15), but this criterion fails to consistently identify the relevant structure across examples—e.g., in Train 1, the frame seems vertical/horizontal borders, but the rule doesn't trigger correctly.
 * Overlap with frame: Only changes small tiles of the same color as the frame if overlap ≥0.5, but this doesn't match expectations (e.g., Train 1 expects some 0s and 1s to stay or change differently, not to 5).
 * Lower position: Tiles in the bottom half (center_y ≥ n/2) that are adjacent to background (including diagonals) and not frame-colored change to 3, but this over-applies (e.g., Train 1 generates extra 3s in bottom where expected has 5s or 0s) and misses upper placements.
 * Zero-filling: Small 0-components adjacent to background change to 5, but this interacts poorly with other rules (applied after, so overrides might miss cases).
 * Background is top-left cell, assumed uniform, but grids have consistent borders (e.g., 8 in Train 1, 9 in Train 2).
 * Order of rules matters: Overlap first, then lower position, then zeros— but this sequence causes cascading errors (e.g., a tile changed to 5 early skips green rule).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes diagonals in some checks, but may not for component finding; zeros (0) are treated specially but may represent "empty" small tiles needing context-specific colors; not all small tiles change—some stay original (e.g., 1s, 2s in expectations); large components (e.g., frames) must not be altered; grids are square (18x18, 15x15, 20x20), but test is 30x30—scale rules accordingly.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected changes are to 5 in upper areas (not just lower), suggesting position rule is inverted or conditional; Train 3 shows symmetric changes (e.g., 1s to nothing, but 3s expand); colors like 1,2,6 may be "noise" or fixed; no rule for propagating colors between similar components.
 * All rules assume one large frame, but examples may have multiple large structures or none; pixel counts and bbox spans are heuristics that don't fit all (e.g., Train 2's frame seems irregular).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it fails all three training examples by applying incorrect color changes based on flawed rule heuristics.
 * Train 1: Generated changes several upper small tiles (e.g., positions around row 2-3, col 7-10 from 0/8 to 5; row 3 col 14-15 from 8 to 5) where expected keeps 0s or changes to other colors; bottom greens (3s) are placed too broadly (e.g., row 9-15 col 3-4 are 3s, but expected has 1s there initially changing differently); zeros filled to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 3 col 9 stays 0 in expected but becomes 5? Wait, no—generated has 0s in places expected has 5s, like row 3 col 16); overall, too many 5s in mid-upper, missing 5s in right column (e.g., row 3-9 col 16 expected 5, generated 0/8).
 * Train 2: Generated keeps some 7s as 3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 col 7-8 to nothing, but expected 5/3; row 7 col 7-8 stay 3 but expected 7); changes bottom 3s too early (row 9-14 col 2-3 to 3, expected 7/4); misses frame overlap (e.g., left frame 4s not propagating to 5); small tiles like row 0 col 6-9 expected 5/3 but generated 4/7; unknown why adjacency rule skips some lower 7s to 3 when expected keeps them.
 * Train 3: Generated fails to change upper 1s/6s to 5/3 (e.g., row 1 col 2-3 stay 1, expected 3; row 8-9 col 1-2 stay 6/5? Expected has 5s expanding left); bottom 3s over-applied (row 10-16 col 7-8 to 3/1, but expected 1/6); frame (background 7) adjacency changes zeros/ smalls wrong (no zeros here, but small 1s/2s not recolored correctly); misses symmetric left-side changes (e.g., row 7-10 col 1 to 5 in expected, generated 6).
 * Rule_orange_from_frame_overlap is broken/not helpful: Triggers too few/often on wrong color matches, missing cases where non-same-color tiles need orange.
 * Rule_green_from_lower_position over-applies to non-adjacent tiles and skips upper ones that need green/orange.
 * Rule_fill_small_zeros helps partially (fills some 0s to 5 adjacent to bg), but interacts badly (e.g., Train 1 fills upper 0s to 5 where expected keeps 0 or changes later).
 * Rule_stabilize_large_frame is unhelpful/irrelevant: Does nothing, but large components need protection—consider expanding to avoid any large changes.
 * Find_large_frame is flawed: Pixel/span ranges don't capture irregular frames (e.g., Train 3's vertical bars not 10-15 span); may return None, skipping rules.
 * Overall, component extraction works (find_components correctly identifies blobs), but rule logic demonstrates poor understanding—changes don't align with patterns like "fill gaps in frames" or "color based on enclosure."

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It appears to copy the input almost unchanged (e.g., all 1s, 9s, 0s stay as-is, no recoloring observed in the printed grid), suggesting rules failed to trigger (e.g., no 3s or 5s added, despite small 0s/1s tiles present like row 8 col 6-8 0s adjacent to 4 bg; upper 9s/1s not changed to frame-like 5). This mismatches puzzle intent, as trainings show small tiles (e.g., 0s,1s) should recolor to 3/5 based on position/adjacency—here, lower 0s (row 19-21 col 21-23) stay 0, upper 1s stay 1. Likely, large_frame detection fails on the 30x30 scale (borders are 4, but inner structures like horizontal 9s/1s bars may not fit 19-86 pixels), and small_tile filter misses some (e.g., the 7-pixel 1s in row 2-4 col 5-11). No changes mean the program didn't apply rules effectively, making output senseless for the puzzle—expect more 5s in frame-overlaps (e.g., inner 1s bars) and 3s in lower isolated tiles.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

(These are helpful for edge visibility checks, but has_right_visible may need fixing to not special-case 1.)

(These are helpful for special case edge-touching, using adjacency to bg.)

                out[ni][nj] = 5
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs/objects) of specific colors in a background grid, evaluate their visibility from edges (top, left, right, bottom), and transform them to new colors (e.g., 3 or 5) based on shape ratios (width vs height), visibility conditions, and background-specific rules, before performing a flood fill from certain seed values (odd numbers like 1,3,5,7,9) to fill empty (0) spaces with 5, likely simulating some kind of object occlusion or rendering in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals) groups of the same non-background, non-zero value; empty spaces are 0.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0]; exclude bg from consideration for changes, and visibility checks ignore bg and 0.
 * For "green" colors (1,7,9 if not bg): Change to 3 if top-visible and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)).
 * For "orange" colors (4,6 if not bg): Change to 5 if (top or left visible) and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)); subtle: this seems to target horizontal-ish bars or protrusions.
 * Special case if bg==8: Change 2-components to 3 if bottom-visible (perhaps shadows or ground-level objects).
 * Flood fill: Starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9}, spreads to adjacent 0s (8 directions) filling with 5, but only if not visited; subtle: this might simulate filling hidden/empty areas behind visible objects, but it can overfill if seeds are misplaced.
 * Visibility: A component is "top-visible" if any cell has no non-bg/non-0 above it in the same column; similar for left (same row left), right (same row right), bottom (below).
 * Subtleties: Changes use a dict to avoid overwriting; components must be non-empty; shape ratio uses bounding box (min/max i/j +1 for h/w); easy to miss: visibility is per-cell then any in component, and changes only if do_change condition met; flood fill uses BFS but seeds include post-change values, so order matters (changes before fill); bg can be colors like 4,8,9 affecting which are "greens/oranges"; no diagonal-only connections—full 8-way; potential over-changing if multiple rules overlap; empty grid areas stay bg unless filled.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle variable grid sizes; ensure copy_grid preserves original; visited prevents re-flood; but flood seeds include 5 which might self-propagate if adjacent to 0; rules seem asymmetric (favor horizontal changes, right/bottom less prioritized); test inputs may have no 0s initially, so fill only creates if changes introduce them? No—changes replace to 3/5, fill only targets existing 0s; subtle miss: expected outputs have 0s where generated has 5/3, suggesting changes should introduce 0s or not fill certain areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) passed Training example 3 (correct output matched), showing core component extraction, visibility, and flood fill work in some cases.
 * Failed Training 1: Generated filled areas with 5 and changed to 3 where expected has 0s and 2/5; specifically, upper blob (likely 2?) changed incorrectly to 3/5 instead of keeping/changing to 2 with 0s for hidden parts; flood fill over-applied 5 to what should be 0s; bottom 3s correct, but side 1s unchanged correctly; unknown why 2 not handled as special (bg=8 rule applied but wrong visibility?).
 * Failed Training 2: Generated kept some 5/3 but misplaced 4/6 vs expected (e.g., row 5 col 1-2: generated 5,5 expected 4,6; row 12 col 5: generated 4 expected 4 but surrounding mismatches); changes to 5/3 over-applied to vertical-ish components; flood fill didn't create 0s, but expected has no 0s—issue is wrong color swaps (e.g., 6s became 5?); bg=9, so greens=1,7 but input has 3,5,6,4,7—3 not changed, but oranges=4,6 changed wrong.
 * extract_components is essential and correct (used successfully in the correct example 3).
 * Visibility functions are helpful but subtle bug: they check per-cell but return if ANY visible, which is correct, but in train1, top_vis likely true but do_change wrong for vertical blobs.
 * Flood fill is mostly helpful but unhelpful in cases with no 0s (does nothing, correct) or overfills post-change seeds; in train1, it filled what should be 0s (perhaps changes didn't introduce 0s, but expected has them—suggests rule should set some to 0 instead of 3/5).
 * Changes dict avoids overlaps, helpful; greens/oranges filtering by !=bg is key but missed if bg in list (e.g., train2 bg=9 not in lists).
 * Overall: Partial rules for horizontal changes work (why example 3 passed), but vertical/square components not distinguished well; special bg=8 rule applied in train1 but wrong (changed 2 to 3, but expected kept 2 with 0s); no handling for keeping 0s or other colors like 2/5 unchanged.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have minimally changed the input (kept most 1,3,5,9 components as-is or swapped some 1/9 to 3 under rules), with no 0s introduced and flood fill doing nothing (since no 0s in input and changes don't create them), resulting in a grid full of 4(bg),1,3,5,9 without occlusions or empties.
 * Expected likely includes 0s in hidden areas (e.g., behind vertical 1s or 9s, similar to train1 where 0s represent occluded space), and possibly more changes to 5 for oranges (but bg=4, so oranges=6 only if present—input has none?); e.g., the large horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 stayed 3 (correct if not green), but vertical 9s in col 21-23 rows 5-20 probably should be partially 0 or changed if not top-visible; side 5s in row8 col6-8 stayed, but if left-visible and wide, should be 5? Wait, already 5; overall, lacks 0s where components overlap shadows, and flood fill missed because no seeds hit 0s—suggests rules need to set some component parts to 0 for depth/occlusion, not just color swap; unknown exact diffs without input grid, but output looks too "filled" vs expected sparse 0s in trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnections and Interactions Across All Train Examples

After comparing the input-output pairs in all three train examples, below is a list of **only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections** between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically in **every** train pair (1, 2, and 3). I ignored any non-consistent changes (e.g., additions only in train 1, position-specific variations that differ across examples, or transformations that aren't uniform). No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., large background-like components with holes >0, unchanged elements, or isolated small pixels without clear ties) are included. Where a transformation lacks a clear, consistent explanation (e.g., why only specific instances change), it is noted as unknown.

- **2x2 square blocks (pixels=4, holes=0, bbox span of 1 unit in both x and y dimensions) → Color change to Green**: In every example, specific instances of these compact square blocks (regardless of original color, such as Red, Dark Red, or Blue) have their color uniformly transformed to Green. The interaction is between the block's shape properties (fixed size/pixels/holes) and an unknown positional or structural factor (e.g., attachment to paths or ends), as not all such blocks change—only a subset does consistently. Unchanged 2x2 blocks (e.g., middle-positioned ones) show no interaction.
  
- **Small linear or single-pixel elements (pixels=1–6, holes=0, bbox indicating thin/horizontal/vertical extension, original color matching apparent background like Yellow, Pink, or implied purple/Maroon fragments) → Color change to Orange**: In every example, these thin or point-like elements (often 1–2 pixels wide, forming short segments) interact with their original color (background-associated) to change specifically to Orange. The connection ties the element's shape (linearity/thinness) and low pixel count to a color override, consistently across examples. The trigger for which exact ones change (vs. those that stay) is unknown, as it varies by position without a uniform rule.

No other interactions (e.g., hole count affecting color, position directly transforming shape, or interactions between specific colors like Blue and Red) are consistent across all three examples. Large elements (e.g., >10 pixels, holes >0) show no consistent changes or ties to smaller ones. Pixel counts and bbox positions do not have uniform effects (e.g., no consistent "bottom → Green" or "top → Orange" rule).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 09:41:52] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to classify and recolor connected components (blobs) of specific colors based on rules like visibility from edges (top, left, right), size, position (e.g., near bottom or top rows), and background color, then flood-filling empty spaces (0's) with 5's starting from seed colors like 1,3,5,7,9 using 8-connectivity. The goal is to produce a modified grid where certain blobs are changed to 3 (green-like) or 5 (orange-like or fill), while preserving others, and ensuring the fill propagates correctly without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is determined from g[0][0] and excludes certain colors from processing (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} - {bg}).
 * Components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals), which is crucial for blob shapes but can merge unexpectedly if not handled.
 * Visibility rules: Top-visible if any cell in component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; left-visible if no blockers left in row; right-visible similarly but checking right side (note: right-visible check in code looks for blockers to the right, but logic may invert intent).
 * Size and position filters: For green (1,7,9), skip if >4 cells; use bounding box height/width (h,w) where w > h or (h==w and top position <=2 and not right-visible) triggers change to 3. For orange (4,6), skip if >6 cells or min row >3; change to 5 if top- or left-visible.
 * Special case for bg==8: Change bottom-touching 2-components to 3, but only if they touch near bottom (i >= n-5, which is arbitrary and may miss subtle bottom definitions).
 * Flood fill starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and spreads to adjacent 0's with 5, using 8-connectivity and visited to avoid revisits, but seeds themselves are not changed (only propagate from them).
 * Empty cells (0's) remain 0 unless filled; non-seed colors like 2,4,6 may stay or change based on rules.
 * Subtle: Flood fill uses directions including diagonals, but only fills 0's; it marks visited but sets to 5 immediately, which could block further spread if not careful. Also, components of size 1-4 for green or <=6 for orange with visibility/position are targeted, but over-application can change non-target blobs.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, 30x29?), so n,m dynamic; bottom-touching defined loosely (e.g., last 5 rows).
 * Potential misses: Right-visibility may be overused or inverted; flood fill seeds include changed colors (3,5), so order matters (changes before fill). No handling for vertical/horizontal dominance beyond w>h. Components must be fully connected; isolated cells count as components.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import collections

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]

def extract_components(g: List[List[int]], target_val: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n, m = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] == target_val:
                component = []
                queue = collections.deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                component.append((i, j))
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == target_val:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                            component.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This extracts 8-connected components for a target color, essential for identifying blobs.)

```python
def has_top_visible(component: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    for i, j in component:
        visible = True
        for k in range(i):
            if g[k][j] != bg and g[k][j] != 0:
                visible = False
                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False

def has_left_visible(component: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    m = len(g[0])
    for i, j in component:
        visible = True
        for l in range(j):
            if g[i][l] != bg and g[i][l] != 0:
                visible = False
                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False

def has_right_visible(component: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    m = len(g[0])
    for i, j in component:
        visible = True
        for l in range(j + 1, m):
            cell = g[i][l]
            if cell != bg and cell != 0:
                visible = False
                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False
```
(These check edge visibility per component cell, key for classification; right_visible may need inversion for "unblocked from right edge".)

```python
def touches_bottom(component: List[Tuple[int, int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return any(i >= n - 5 for i, _ in component)
```
(Helper for bottom position, but threshold n-5 is heuristic and may be too loose/tight.)

```python
def flood_fill_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])
    queue = collections.deque()
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    seeds = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                        out[ni][nj] = 5
                        visited[ni][nj] = True
                        queue.append((ni, nj))
    while queue:
        i, j = queue.popleft()
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni = i + di
            nj = j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                out[ni][nj] = 5
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(Flood fills 0's from seeds using BFS with 8-connectivity; works but seeds propagate immediately from neighbors, which is correct if seeds are unchanged.)

 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated incorrectly changed left-side 2-blob cells (rows 3-7, cols 2-3) to 5 instead of leaving as 0/2, over-applied orange rules or flood; bottom 2's (rows 14-15, cols 10-11) correctly to 3, but some 5's in cols 14-16 overfilled where expected 0's; right 1's stayed 1 (correct), but flood missed some 0's turning to 5.
 * In training example 1, special bg=8 rule for bottom 2's worked partially (changed to 3), but green/orange rules over-applied to non-visible or large components, e.g., vertical structure in cols 9-10 got 5's where expected 0's.
 * In training example 2 (bg=9), generated kept some 5's and 3's correctly top-left but failed on right-side 6's (row2 col11-12 as 5 instead of 6, row3 col13 as 5? Wait, expected has 6,6,4 so under-changed); orange 4/6 blobs in rows5-6 cols1-3 stayed 4/6 (correct) but flood over-applied 5's in row1 col6? No major flood issue, but component extraction missed splitting or visibility for mid-grid 6's.
 * In training example 2, green 3's top-left correct, but size filter skipped some small components incorrectly; right-bottom 7's stayed 7 (correct, as non-green/orange), but a 5 in row1 col10 incorrect (expected 9? bg).
 * In training example 3 (bg=7), generated under-applied 5's to left 6-blob (rows1-2 cols4-5 as 3? No, as 6, but expected 5's for top parts); over-kept 6's in rows3-9 col2-3 where expected 5's in some; bottom 2's stayed 2 (correct); 1's stayed 1 (correct, perhaps non-target).
 * In training example 3, touches_bottom not triggered correctly for some, and visibility (top/left) missed for horizontal dominance; flood fill under-applied, leaving some 0's? But outputs show no 0's visible, differences in 3 vs 5 for 6-blobs.
 * extract_components is helpful and seems correct (8-connectivity matches blob shapes in diffs).
 * has_top_visible, has_left_visible, has_right_visible are essential but right_visible logic checks for no blockers to right (meaning visible from right edge?), which may be inverted—generated often fails when right-visible should block change.
 * flood_fill_from_seeds works for propagation but starts only from seeds' neighbors, not overwriting seeds; in trains, it overfills some 0's to 5 where expected 0 (e.g., train1 left structure).
 * Special bg==8 rule partially worked (bottom 2 to 3) but applied too broadly; general green/orange rules too aggressive on size/position (e.g., min_i <=3 too loose, len>4 skip misses small visible).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but touches_bottom with fixed -5 is heuristic and not general (breaks for varying grid heights).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (30x29? grid, bg=4) has many 5's already placed (e.g., row8 cols6-8 as 5,5,5; row19-21 cols21-23 as 5's), suggesting pre-flood changes, but looks over-filled—e.g., scattered 5's in row8 col6-8 may be from orange rule on 5? Input has 5's? Wait, the "generated output" includes original colors like 9's,1's,4's unchanged in places, with some 5's added (e.g., row8), but no visible 0's left, implying flood filled everything adjacent to seeds.
 * Test output does not look fully correct: It preserves large 1-blobs (e.g., rows3-4 cols5-12 as 1's, expected perhaps change to 3 if small/visible green), but adds 5's in isolated spots like row8 cols6-8 (possibly erroneous flood from nearby 5? Input has 5 there? No, input not given, but output has them as 5 while surrounding 1's/4's); bottom rows have 5's in row19-21 cols21-23, which may be correct fill but over-spreads to row22 col21 as 1? Wait, row22 has 1's.
 * Test output misses potential 3-changes for top 9/1 blobs (rows2-3 cols2-5,14-21 as 9/1, visible from top/left but stayed, violating green rule if size<=4); flood seems to have filled some but left paths open incorrectly (e.g., row12 col24-26 as 9's, possibly unfilled 0's? But output shows no 0's, all filled or colored).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (fills from seeds like 1,5,9 to 5 in empties), but incorrect due to unchanged green-like blobs (1,9) that should be 3 if visible/small, and possible over-change of 4's to 5 without position check; looks like rules applied but visibility/size thresholds wrong, leading to under-classification.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 09:41:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 10:06:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where regions of uniform colors represent connected components (blobs) that must be recolored based on structural rules, likely modeling plant-like objects such as leaves (colored 3), stems or branches (colored 5), flowers or centers (possibly 1 or 2), and empty spaces (0), while preserving the background color (b, e.g., 8, 9, 7, 4) and avoiding recoloring irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (b) is the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test); never recolor it, and use it to define "non-background" for adjacency checks.
 * Identify 2x2 squares of the same non-b, non-0 color c; recolor them to 3 (green/leaves) only if they have horizontal adjacency to a non-b, non-c cell (subtle: check left/right for each of the 4 cells in the square, but code checks only horizontal, missing vertical/diagonal adjacencies that might be required).
 * Stem color is the first non-b, non-3 color (including 0) that is 4-way adjacent to any 3; then recolor entire connected components (4-way) of that stem color to 5 if the component is in the same row as a 3 OR 8-way adjacent to a 3 (subtle: components must satisfy both conditions in some cases, but code uses OR, leading to over-coloring; also, prioritize "first" stem by iterating used colors + 0).
 * For blue (hardcoded as 1), recolor 0-components (4-way connected) to 5 if attached 4-way to blue AND have at least one upward (north) neighbor that is blue (subtle: "upward attachment" means specifically checking above each cell in the component, not just any attachment).
 * Isolated single 0 cells (size-1 components with no 4-way adjacent non-b) get recolored to 5 (subtle: count adjacencies correctly during flood-fill, but code increments adj_non_b per neighbor, which may overcount if shared).
 * 0 represents empty/fillable space; it can act as a stem or be colored based on attachments, but not all 0s are recolored—only those meeting criteria (subtle: some 0s remain 0 if not isolated or not attached properly, e.g., in training 1 expected has many 0s unchanged).
 * Connected components are 4-way for flooding (up/down/left/right), but 8-way for some attachment checks to 3 (subtle: inconsistency in code's directions usage can miss diagonal touches).
 * Colors like 2,6 may represent petals or other elements; they aren't recolored in this attempt but appear in expectations (e.g., training 1 has 2s unchanged, training 2 has 6s, training 3 has 2s and 6s).
 * Order matters: Color 3s first, then stems to 5, then blue-attached 0s to 5, then isolated 0s to 5 (subtle: later steps may overwrite earlier ones if not careful, e.g., a 0 stem colored to 5 could conflict).
 * Grids vary in size (18x18 for training 1/3, 15x15 for 2, 30x30 for test); ensure n=len(g) handles all.
 * Subtle miss: In qualifying 2x2 for 3, adjacency check is flawed—code only checks horizontal left/right for the square's cells, but expectations suggest broader "exposed" or "leaf-like" criteria (e.g., not fully enclosed).
 * 0 can be part of larger structures but only recolored if criteria met; many 0s in expectations remain 0, indicating not all empties are stems or isolations.
 * Blue=1 interactions are specific to "upward" (vertical above), suggesting directionality like growth from base.
 * No recoloring of other colors (e.g., 2,6 stay as-is in expectations).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple

def is_valid(x: int, y: int, n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n

def get_used_colors(grid: List[List[int]], b: int) -> Set[int]:
    s: Set[int] = set()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != b:
                s.add(cell)
    return s
```

```python
directions4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
directions8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]
```
These are useful for validation, color extraction, and adjacency (4-way for components, 8-way for attachments). The color_qualifying_squares function is partially helpful for 2x2 detection but broken in adjacency logic (only horizontal checks, misses cases). Flood-fill with stack for components is good but needs better condition checks (e.g., for has_same_row and attached_to_green).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of rules.
 * Training 1: Generated over-colored many areas to 3 and 5 (e.g., bottom-right 3s and 5s where expected has 3s but keeps 0s and 2s unchanged; top-left 2x2 became 3 but expected keeps as 2; isolated 0s partially colored to 5 but some 5s appear where expected has 0s or 2s; stem logic misidentified, coloring extra 5s in rows without proper attachment).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Expected has 2s in top-left and bottom-left unchanged, many 0s preserved (e.g., vertical chains of 0s next to 2s stay 0, not 5); generated has 3s there and extra 5s (e.g., row 3 col 16-17 as 5 but expected 5 only in specific spots); unknown why stem=2 wasn't chosen correctly, leading to wrong 5 placements.
 * Training 2: Generated colored some 0s/empties to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 11-12 as 5 but expected 6; row 5 col 0 as 5 but expected 4; bottom 7s partially to 5 but expected keeps 7s); 3s correct in some 2x2 but missed propagating to adjacent 6s or 4s; blue=1 logic absent, so no upward 0 coloring; over-colored stems without row/adjacency checks.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Expected has 6s as a separate component (possibly petals) unchanged, 4s in specific chains, 7s at bottom; generated has 5s overwriting potential 6/4/7 areas (e.g., row 7 col 0 as 5 but expected 4); subtle: missed that some 3s attach to non-stem colors like 6, not coloring them to 5.
 * Training 3: Generated under-colored some areas (e.g., row 4 col 13-14 as 3 but expected 2; row 5 col 12 as 6 but expected 2; many 1s and 6s unchanged correctly but 5s over-applied in left column); stem logic colored extra 5s (e.g., row 10 col 14 as 5 but expected 6 or unchanged); isolated 0s not present, but blue=1 attachments missed upward specificity.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Expected has 2s in mid-left (rows 4-5 col 13-14) as a distinct element, 6s in chains (e.g., row 11 col 6-7 as 1 but wait, expected has 1s there? No, generated has 3s where expected 1/6; unknown why 2x2 detection failed for certain colors); 5s in top but generated spreads them incorrectly.
 * Overall: 2x2 to 3 works in some spots (e.g., training 1 top 3s) but over-applies without proper adjacency; stem selection picks wrong color (e.g., colors 0 as stem instead of 2); 0 to 5 rules partial (isolated good, but blue-upward misses directionality, and components over-colored if OR instead of AND); no handling for other colors like 2/6 as potential centers/petal unchanged.
 * Function color_qualifying_squares is partially helpful but broken (adjacency only horizontal, should be broader exposure check); get_used_colors and flood-fill stack are essential and correct for components.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but hardcoded blue=1 limits generality (if blue varies, fails); visited matrices reset per rule is good but inefficient for large grids like test.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3s in long horizontal/vertical lines (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 3-11 and 15-21 as solid 3s, but likely input has sparse colors needing only specific 2x2 qualified; this suggests 2x2 detection generalized wrongly to lines, not just squares).
 * Many 5s appear in scattered spots (e.g., row 8 col 6-7,9 as 5/0/5, but 0 remains—isolated rule partial; row 10 col 6-8 as 5s where possibly stem but over-colored without row match).
 * 1s and 9s preserved in clusters (good for unchanged elements), but 0s like row 8 col 7 remain 0 (correct if not isolated/attached), yet surrounding 5s suggest missed component merging.
 * Bottom sections (rows 18-25) have 5s in row 18-20 col 21-23, possibly from isolated 0s or stems, but chains of 1s and 9s unchanged—looks plausible for attachments but likely incorrect due to training failures (e.g., no upward blue checks visible, and 3s in row 25 col 13-15 may be wrong 2x2).
 * Overall, test output has too many 3s (line-filling instead of square-specific) and partial 5s, missing preservation of 0s/2-like elements; doesn't make sense as a "plant" structure—appears noisy, not structured like expectations' clean components.

[2025-10-03 10:06:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 10:25:00] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or modification, likely a type of logic puzzle (e.g., similar to nonogram, fillomino, or region-based filling) where input grids with partial numbers (0-9 representing colors, sizes, or fills) need to be updated by setting specific cells to correct values based on patterns, symmetries, or rules like matching adjacent regions or completing shapes. The goal is to produce an exact output grid that matches hidden rules, but the current approach uses size-specific hardcoding of cell changes, which partially mimics patterns but fails to generalize or apply the correct values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 15x15, 18x18, 20x20, 30x30), and rules may depend on size, but hardcoding per size misses underlying logic like symmetry, region grouping, or number propagation (e.g., filling regions with consistent numbers like 3s for size-3 areas).
 * Numbers represent distinct elements: e.g., 0 might be empty/blank, 1-9 could be fills for shapes/objects (possibly region sizes in fillomino-style puzzles where equal numbers form connected regions of that size), and backgrounds are consistent (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test).
 * Subtle elements: Changes often cluster in specific areas (e.g., corners, centers, or borders), suggesting rules for completing incomplete shapes (e.g., extending lines or filling blobs); mismatches occur when wrong numbers are used (e.g., 7 instead of 5), indicating values must derive from puzzle logic like counting adjacent cells or matching patterns, not arbitrary assignment.
 * Symmetry is common (e.g., mirrored patterns in trainings), but not always perfect; avoid over-applying changes that break existing structures.
 * Background numbers differ per puzzle (e.g., 8=background in train1, but 7/9 are fills); overwriting incorrectly can corrupt inputs.
 * For larger grids like 30x30, sparse changes (e.g., only 18 cells) suggest focused completions, but rules might require detecting multiple objects/regions.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have new numbers (e.g., 3,5) not in the hardcoded 7/9, implying dynamic value calculation (e.g., based on region size); also, some positions remain unchanged if already correct.
 * All attempts assume input grids are partial and need targeted fills, but no validation of connectivity or rule satisfaction (e.g., no region size checks).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No truly helpful general functions in the attempt; the program relies on hardcoded lists, which are brittle and size-specific. The deepcopy is useful for preserving inputs but not puzzle-solving.

```python
from copy import deepcopy  # Useful for non-destructive modification of input grid
```

```python
# No extraction functions provided; a potential helpful one (not in attempt) could be for identifying regions:
def find_regions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Placeholder: DFS/BFS to group connected same-number cells, returning list of region coords and size
    # This would help detect what needs filling (e.g., incomplete regions of size X get filled with X)
    pass  # Not implemented; attempt lacks anything like this, making it unhelpful for generalization
```

The hardcoded changes list is somewhat helpful for pattern observation (e.g., clustering in rows 8-10 for n=30) but broken for correctness—it's not rule-based and fails all tests; avoid reusing without logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) is hardcoded per grid size, correctly identifying some change locations (e.g., in train1, it sets bottom-right clusters near expected 3/5 areas, and row 13-15 cols 10-11 to 9 where expected has 3s) but uses wrong values (e.g., 7s instead of 5s in train1 rows 3/11/12 col16 and equivalents; 9s instead of 3s in train1 rows 13-15; misses introducing 3s entirely).
 * Worked: Partial positional accuracy (e.g., train2 changes top rows to 7/9 in areas where expected has 5/3, suggesting it detects "top banner" patterns; train3 places some 1/2/6 in mid-grid matching expected positions but wrong values like 9s instead of 3/5 in rows 1-2; for n=30, it targets two 3x3 blocks to 9, which might align with expected clusters but value wrong).
 * Didn't work: All three trainings fully incorrect due to value mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 7/9 where expected 5/3, corrupting shape colors; train2 top row generated [9s and 7s] vs expected [9s with 5/3/5]; train3 rows 1-2 generated 9s vs expected 3s/5s, and misses extending 5s leftward in row8-9; no changes for unlisted sizes, but test is 30x30 with partial changes only). Fails to propagate numbers correctly (e.g., doesn't fill entire regions consistently).
 * Missed dynamic value assignment (e.g., why 5/3 in expected? Possibly region sizes—e.g., count connected 0s or blanks to assign); over-relies on 7/9 without basis.
 * Train1: Mismatches in bottom (e.g., row12 col3: gen8 exp nothing changed? but overall 7 vs5 in col16; row13 col10-11: gen9 exp3; unknown why 9 chosen over 3—perhaps mispatterned from other grids).
 * Train2: Top mismatches (row0: gen7/9/9/7 vs exp5/3/3/5; row1 partial 9/7/9 vs3/5/3/3/5); middle unchanged correctly but top "header" wrong.
 * Train3: Upper mismatches (row1-2: gen9/9 vs3/3 and5/5; misses left extension of5s in row8-9: gen7/5? wait gen has7s background but fills wrong); lower matches better (e.g., 2s in rows17-18 correct pos but context wrong).
 * No extraction functions; attempting to add region-finding (as placeholder) is essential for future, as hardcoding ignores object detection.
 * deepcopy is helpful but trivial; no broken functions beyond the changes list being non-generalizable.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for presumed 30x30 input) does not look correct; it shows extensive patterns of 1s, 9s, and 4s forming what appear to be symmetric shapes/clusters (e.g., 9s in cols2-4 rows2-4 and symmetric on right; 1s forming borders or frames around centers in rows5-25), but this seems over-modified beyond the program's sparse changes (only 18 cells to9 in two 3x3 blocks at rows8-10 cols6-8 and rows18-20 cols21-23), suggesting the input already had 1s/9s and the output is mostly input + minor9s, but patterns don't form coherent objects (e.g., 1s clusters look like incomplete frames without consistent region sizes; 9s blocks are isolated and may not match expected fills like 2/3/5 from trainings). It lacks the focused, rule-based completion seen in expected trainings (e.g., no evidence of region-size filling), and since trainings failed similarly (wrong values in clusters), this likely has incorrect values (e.g., 1s/9s where expected might need 2/6 or similar for size-matching). Doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle—shapes are asymmetric in fills and miss background purity (4s interrupted oddly); to handle test, need general region detection to assign correct numbers dynamically, not just add9s.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 10:25:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where numbers represent colors or object types (e.g., 1,2,3,5 for different elements, 8/7/9/4 likely for borders or backgrounds), and zeros indicate empty spaces that may or may not need filling based on rules. The goal appears to be transforming the input grid by applying color mappings, completing shapes, or filling specific regions while preserving empties in certain areas, rather than a uniform fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Zeros (empty spaces) are not always filled; in expected outputs, some remain 0 (e.g., scattered empties inside shapes in training example 1), suggesting selective filling based on proximity to objects, containment, or pattern completion—uniform filling with 5 (orange) overwrites these and fails.
 * Existing numbers sometimes change values (e.g., in training example 1, bottom-right 2,2 pairs become 3,3 in expected, while top 2,2 stay 2,2; in example 2, some 7's become 3's and 4's become 5's), indicating rule-based recoloring, possibly mapping colors by object type, size, or position (e.g., symmetric or mirrored changes).
 * Background/border values (8 in ex1, 9 in ex2, 7 in ex3, 4 in test) remain unchanged, but inner regions show pattern extensions or fills (e.g., in ex1, new 3,3 blocks appear where input might have had partials or empties; in ex3, 1,1 and 6,6 extend into 5's or 3's).
 * Shapes seem to be "objects" like blobs or lines (e.g., pairs of 1's, 2's, 6's), which may need extraction for analysis—rules could involve counting connected components, filling enclosed areas, or applying color swaps based on global patterns (e.g., orange 5 fills some but not all voids).
 * Subtle: Outputs maintain grid structure but alter internals; empties near borders or outside shapes stay 0, while those inside get filled (but not always with 5—e.g., ex1 has 0's inside what looks like a frame). Possible symmetry or mirroring (e.g., ex1 has mirrored 1,1 and 2,2 placements). Avoid over-filling, as it breaks expected 0 preservation. Consider object adjacency or flooding from seeds.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): No object extraction, so misses identifying regions; uniform fill ignores why some 0's stay (e.g., non-contiguous empties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid without modification—useful as a base for safe transformations."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Extract positions of connected regions (e.g., blobs of same number) using flood-fill; helpful for identifying objects to recolor or fill around.
    Assumes 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right). Returns list of (i,j) positions."""
    if g[start_i][start_j] != target_val:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    component = []
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == target_val:
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```

(Note: No other functions from the attempt are helpful; `fill_zeros_with_orange` is broken as it uniformly fills all 0's, ignoring selective rules, and should not be reused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly copies the grid and fills all 0's with 5 (orange), which works for preserving non-zero values and borders but fails entirely on selective filling—e.g., in train1, it turns expected internal 0's (like row2 col7=0) into 5's, but expected keeps them 0; also mismatches recoloring (e.g., row14 col10-11=2,2 becomes 3,3 in expected, but attempt leaves as 2,2).
 * In train1, generated has extra 5's in places like row3 col6=5 (expected 0), and bottom 2,2 unchanged where expected has 3,3—difference unknown but likely due to missing color mapping for specific object types (e.g., bottom blobs are a different "color" class).
 * In train2, generated leaves some values like 7's and 4's unchanged (e.g., row1 col7-8=7,7 becomes 3,3 in expected), filling 0's with 5's incorrectly (e.g., row1 col6=5 in expected but was 0? Wait, input not shown, but output shows mismatches like row0 col6=4 in generated vs 5 in expected)—indicates no recoloring logic.
 * In train3, generated keeps 1's as 1's and 6's as 6's (e.g., row1 col2-3=1,1 unchanged, but expected has 3,3), and fills 0's with 5's where expected extends patterns differently (e.g., row2 col10-13=6,6,6,6 becomes 5,5,5,5)—suggests missing blob extension or type-based filling.
 * No extraction of objects, so can't identify why some regions (e.g., enclosed 0's) get filled vs. others stay empty; uniform approach misses all subtleties like color swaps (2->3, 1->3? patterns).
 * `fill_zeros_with_orange` is unhelpful/broken: it over-fills and ignores recoloring, leading to all training failures; do not reuse without conditions (e.g., only fill if adjacent to certain objects).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of the input with 0's filled as 5's (e.g., row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where likely 0's were), but preserves input numbers like 9's,1's, and a single 5, while borders are 4's unchanged. This mismatches the pattern from training, where outputs involve recoloring (e.g., no 2->3-like changes here, and scattered 0's should likely remain in non-shape areas like inside the 9/1 frames). It looks incorrect because it doesn't complete or alter shapes (e.g., the 1,1 pairs and 9 blocks seem unextended, unlike train1's 3,3 additions); instead, it's just a lazy fill, ignoring why train examples needed specific changes. To fix, need rules for object detection (e.g., treat 1's as one type to extend/fill around) and handle larger grid (30 cols) with possible symmetry in the 9/1/5 regions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids containing various numbers (representing colors or components like 0 for empty, 1 for blue, 2 for something else, etc.) are modified according to specific rules to produce output grids, likely involving selective filling of empties (0s) with orange (5), conditional color changes (e.g., blue 1 to green 3 in some areas), and preserving structural elements (e.g., backgrounds like 8, 9, 7, 4). The goal is to identify patterns from training examples, such as connected components or regions, to apply transformations only where rules match, rather than globally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Not all empty spaces (0s) are filled with orange (5); in train example 1 expected output, many 0s remain unfilled (e.g., positions like row 1 col 7 is 0, row 3 col 5 is 0), suggesting filling is selective, possibly only in certain connected regions, bounded areas, or non-structural empties, while others (e.g., in outlines or specific shapes) stay 0 to maintain transparency or separation.
 * Blue (1) changes to green (3) are not universal; in train example 1 expected, some 1s remain 1 (e.g., row 1-2 col 15-16 are 1s), while others become 3 (e.g., row 14-15 col 4-5 are 3s, possibly from original 1s or other colors); this implies changes based on connectivity, enclosure, or adjacency to other elements like 2s or 5s, not blanket replacement.
 * Structural backgrounds (e.g., 8 in train 1, 9/4/7 in train 2, 7 in train 3) are preserved unchanged, but some non-background elements like 7s in train 2 are transformed to 3s or 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9 expected 3s vs. generated 7s), indicating rules distinguish between fixed structures and mutable components, possibly via flood-fill or component detection.
 * In train example 3 expected, some areas get 5s (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 expected 3,3 but with 5s in row 2 col 10-13), and 1s appear in places like row 7 col 10-11, suggesting introductions of new colors (1 or 5) in enclosed or adjacent regions, and selective filling of 0s only in specific blobs (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 has 5s where generated has 3s incorrectly).
 * Subtle element: Transformations may involve "components" (connected groups of same-number cells, 4- or 8-connected), as hinted in the attempt's docstring; e.g., in train 1, blue components near certain shapes change, but isolated ones don't—need to detect and classify components by size, shape, or enclosure.
 * Across examples, 2s (possibly red or objects) remain unchanged, 5s (orange) are added selectively, and greens (3) replace blues (1) or other colors (like 7s in train 2) only in "interior" or bounded areas; empties in "exteriors" or outlines stay 0.
 * Potential oversight: Rules might prioritize "filling holes" in objects (e.g., enclosed 0s become 5), changing colors based on surrounding structures (e.g., 1 inside a 2-shape becomes 3), and no global changes—requires spatial analysis like bounding boxes or adjacency checks.
 * All training outputs are incorrect, showing over-application: generated fills EVERY 0 to 5 (but expected keeps many 0s) and changes EVERY 1 to 3 (but expected keeps some 1s and changes others conditionally).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No truly helpful functions were provided in this attempt; the existing ones are overly simplistic and broken for the puzzle:
```python
# This function is broken: It fills ALL 0s indiscriminately, but puzzle requires selective filling (e.g., only enclosed or specific regions). Not helpful—avoid in future.
def fill_empty_spaces_with_orange(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 0:
                new_g[i][j] = 5
    return new_g
```
```python
# This function is broken: Changes ALL 1s to 3s, but some 1s must remain (e.g., train 1 top-right). Not helpful without component detection—avoid or modify to target specific connected 1-groups.
def change_blue_components_to_green(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 1:
                new_g[i][j] = 3
    return new_g
```
```python
# This is a no-op (identity function), which is correct for preserving structures but unhelpful alone—puzzle needs it combined with conditional logic.
def keep_structural_elements_unchanged(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
Future attempts should include tools like:
```python
# Suggested: Detect connected components (e.g., using flood-fill) to classify regions for selective changes.
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Basic flood-fill to get positions of connected cells with target_val; return set of (i,j) for analysis (e.g., size, enclosure).
    # Implementation omitted for brevity, but essential for identifying "components" mentioned in attempt docstrings.
    pass
```
```python
# Suggested: Check if a region is "enclosed" (e.g., surrounded by non-0/non-target walls) to decide filling or color change.
def is_enclosed(g: List[List[int]], component_positions: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    # Analyze bounding box or adjacency to background (e.g., 8/9/7/4); true if no path to edge.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) blindly fills all 0s with 5 and all 1s with 3, ignoring selectivity—resulting in train 1 generated having extra 5s where expected has 0s (e.g., row 1 col 7: generated 5 vs. expected 0; row 3 col 5: 5 vs. 0) and extra 3s where expected has 1s (e.g., row 1 col 15-16: 3 vs. 1), and missing new 3s in bottom (e.g., row 14 col 4-5: generated 2? wait, actually 3 from change, but positions mismatch overall).
 * Train 2 mismatches heavily: generated keeps 7s and 4s unchanged where expected changes to 3s and 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9: generated 7,7 vs. expected 3,3; row 0 col 6 and 9: 4 vs. 5), and no 0-filling needed here but over-applies if any 0s present—suggests 7s or other colors change conditionally to 3/5, not just 1s.
 * Train 3 mismatches: generated changes 1s? but expected introduces 5s in places like row 2 col 2-3 (generated 3 vs. expected 5? wait, row 2: generated 3,3,7,...5,5,... but expected 3,3,7,...5,5,... wait, partial match but row 3 col 2: generated 6 vs. expected 5; and adds 1s in row 7-8 col 10-11 expected but generated likely 3 if 1s present, or unchanged—unknown input but shows over-changing.
 * Missed core: No component extraction or enclosure checks, leading to global ops instead of rule-based (e.g., fill enclosed 0s, change interior 1s).
 * The "keep_structural_elements_unchanged" is correct in intent but trivial/unhelpful without integration.
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, which is essential for subtleties like connected blues or holes—future needs flood-fill or similar.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding (e.g., orange for empties, green for blues, preserve structures) but fails execution due to lack of conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same global rules (fill 0s to 5, 1s to 3), resulting in widespread 5s (e.g., row 8 col 6-8: 5,5,5 likely from 0s) and 3s preserved/changed (e.g., many 3s in rows 2-4 and 12-15, possibly original or from 1s), but given training failures, this likely over-fills empties (e.g., scattered 5s in row 8-9 may be where expected keeps 0s or other values) and incorrectly changes components (e.g., bottom rows have 5s in row 20-21 col 21-23, which might be selective in expected but global here).
 * It mismatches puzzle subtleties: e.g., dense 4-background preserved (good), but 3-clusters in top/mid (rows 2-4 col 5-12 and 20-23) seem unchanged, yet if input had 1s there, changing all would be wrong per train 1; scattered 5s (e.g., row 8 col 20-21: 3,3 but nearby 5s) suggest unfilled areas should remain 0 or get different treatment.
 * Does not make sense as final output—looks like a naive transformation without spatial rules, e.g., no evident selective filling for enclosed regions (test grid has complex shapes like 9-blobs and 3-lines, likely needing component-based changes); expected probably keeps some 0s (not shown, but inferred from trains) and conditional 1-to-3 or other swaps (e.g., some 9s or 4s to 5/3?).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or modification, likely a type of logic puzzle (e.g., similar to nonogram, fillomino, or region-based filling) where input grids with partial numbers (0-9 representing colors, sizes, or fills) need to be updated by setting specific cells to correct values based on patterns, symmetries, or rules like matching adjacent regions or completing shapes. The goal is to produce an exact output grid that matches hidden rules, but the current approach uses size-specific hardcoding of cell changes, which partially mimics patterns but fails to generalize or apply the correct values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 15x15, 18x18, 20x20, 30x30), and rules may depend on size, but hardcoding per size misses underlying logic like symmetry, region grouping, or number propagation (e.g., filling regions with consistent numbers like 3s for size-3 areas).
 * Numbers represent distinct elements: e.g., 0 might be empty/blank, 1-9 could be fills for shapes/objects (possibly region sizes in fillomino-style puzzles where equal numbers form connected regions of that size), and backgrounds are consistent (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test).
 * Subtle elements: Changes often cluster in specific areas (e.g., corners, centers, or borders), suggesting rules for completing incomplete shapes (e.g., extending lines or filling blobs); mismatches occur when wrong numbers are used (e.g., 7 instead of 5), indicating values must derive from puzzle logic like counting adjacent cells or matching patterns, not arbitrary assignment.
 * Symmetry is common (e.g., mirrored patterns in trainings), but not always perfect; avoid over-applying changes that break existing structures.
 * Background numbers differ per puzzle (e.g., 8=background in train1, but 7/9 are fills); overwriting incorrectly can corrupt inputs.
 * For larger grids like 30x30, sparse changes (e.g., only 18 cells) suggest focused completions, but rules might require detecting multiple objects/regions.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have new numbers (e.g., 3,5) not in the hardcoded 7/9, implying dynamic value calculation (e.g., based on region size); also, some positions remain unchanged if already correct.
 * All attempts assume input grids are partial and need targeted fills, but no validation of connectivity or rule satisfaction (e.g., no region size checks).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No truly helpful general functions in the attempt; the program relies on hardcoded lists, which are brittle and size-specific. The deepcopy is useful for preserving inputs but not puzzle-solving.

```python
from copy import deepcopy  # Useful for non-destructive modification of input grid
```

```python
# No extraction functions provided; a potential helpful one (not in attempt) could be for identifying regions:
def find_regions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Placeholder: DFS/BFS to group connected same-number cells, returning list of region coords and size
    # This would help detect what needs filling (e.g., incomplete regions of size X get filled with X)
    pass  # Not implemented; attempt lacks anything like this, making it unhelpful for generalization
```

The hardcoded changes list is somewhat helpful for pattern observation (e.g., clustering in rows 8-10 for n=30) but broken for correctness—it's not rule-based and fails all tests; avoid reusing without logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) is hardcoded per grid size, correctly identifying some change locations (e.g., in train1, it sets bottom-right clusters near expected 3/5 areas, and row 13-15 cols 10-11 to 9 where expected has 3s) but uses wrong values (e.g., 7s instead of 5s in train1 rows 3/11/12 col16 and equivalents; 9s instead of 3s in train1 rows 13-15; misses introducing 3s entirely).
 * Worked: Partial positional accuracy (e.g., train2 changes top rows to 7/9 in areas where expected has 5/3, suggesting it detects "top banner" patterns; train3 places some 1/2/6 in mid-grid matching expected positions but wrong values like 9s instead of 3/5 in rows 1-2; for n=30, it targets two 3x3 blocks to 9, which might align with expected clusters but value wrong).
 * Didn't work: All three trainings fully incorrect due to value mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 7/9 where expected 5/3, corrupting shape colors; train2 top row generated [9s and 7s] vs expected [9s with 5/3/5]; train3 rows 1-2 generated 9s vs expected 3s/5s, and misses extending 5s leftward in row8-9; no changes for unlisted sizes, but test is 30x30 with partial changes only). Fails to propagate numbers correctly (e.g., doesn't fill entire regions consistently).
 * Missed dynamic value assignment (e.g., why 5/3 in expected? Possibly region sizes—e.g., count connected 0s or blanks to assign); over-relies on 7/9 without basis.
 * Train1: Mismatches in bottom (e.g., row12 col3: gen8 exp nothing changed? but overall 7 vs5 in col16; row13 col10-11: gen9 exp3; unknown why 9 chosen over 3—perhaps mispatterned from other grids).
 * Train2: Top mismatches (row0: gen7/9/9/7 vs exp5/3/3/5; row1 partial 9/7/9 vs3/5/3/3/5); middle unchanged correctly but top "header" wrong.
 * Train3: Upper mismatches (row1-2: gen9/9 vs3/3 and5/5; misses left extension of5s in row8-9: gen7/5? wait gen has7s background but fills wrong); lower matches better (e.g., 2s in rows17-18 correct pos but context wrong).
 * No extraction functions; attempting to add region-finding (as placeholder) is essential for future, as hardcoding ignores object detection.
 * deepcopy is helpful but trivial; no broken functions beyond the changes list being non-generalizable.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for presumed 30x30 input) does not look correct; it shows extensive patterns of 1s, 9s, and 4s forming what appear to be symmetric shapes/clusters (e.g., 9s in cols2-4 rows2-4 and symmetric on right; 1s forming borders or frames around centers in rows5-25), but this seems over-modified beyond the program's sparse changes (only 18 cells to9 in two 3x3 blocks at rows8-10 cols6-8 and rows18-20 cols21-23), suggesting the input already had 1s/9s and the output is mostly input + minor9s, but patterns don't form coherent objects (e.g., 1s clusters look like incomplete frames without consistent region sizes; 9s blocks are isolated and may not match expected fills like 2/3/5 from trainings). It lacks the focused, rule-based completion seen in expected trainings (e.g., no evidence of region-size filling), and since trainings failed similarly (wrong values in clusters), this likely has incorrect values (e.g., 1s/9s where expected might need 2/6 or similar for size-matching). Doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle—shapes are asymmetric in fills and miss background purity (4s interrupted oddly); to handle test, need general region detection to assign correct numbers dynamically, not just add9s.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where cells with numeric values (0-9) represent colors, empty space (0), or background, and the task is to identify connected components (likely 8-connected, including diagonals) of specific "object" colors, evaluate their visibility or positioning relative to borders (e.g., top, left, bottom), repaint them with target colors (often 3 or 5), perform flood fills on empty (0) areas from certain seeds or borders to distinguish enclosed vs. open spaces, and handle special cases based on the background color (e.g., bg=8 triggers unique rules). The output transforms the input grid into a segmented or labeled version, preserving background and non-objects while marking "visible" or "enclosed" regions appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), not just 4-connected, as the extraction uses all 8 directions; this is crucial for identifying blob-like objects that touch diagonally.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and it varies across examples (8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3); rules must adapt to bg, e.g., non-bg cells !=0 are potential objects, but 0 is empty/space to fill or flood.
 * Visibility checks: "Top visible" means at least one cell in the component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; "left visible" similarly checks left in the same row. These determine if an object is "exposed" from edges, triggering repaints (e.g., greens to 3 if top-visible, oranges to 5 if top- or left-visible).
 * Special case for bg=8: Only components of color 2 that "touch bottom" (any cell with row >= n-3) get painted to 3; this seems like a "grounded" or "falling" object rule, but the threshold (n-3) may be too loose or arbitrary.
 * Flood filling: Two types—(1) flood_from_seeds starts from cells with values in {1,3,5} and spreads to adjacent 0's (8 directions) with 5, but only marks visited 0's without fully propagating from new 5's in the queue (potential bug: it sets to 5 but queue only adds direct neighbors, not chaining fully? Wait, it does chain via while loop); (2) fill_enclosed_zeros floods from all border 0's (top/bottom/left/right edges) using BFS on 0's (8 directions), marks open/connected-to-border 0's as visited, then paints remaining (enclosed) 0's to 5. This distinguishes holes/ enclosed spaces from outer space.
 * Color groups: "Greens" [1,7,9] painted to 3 if top-visible (perhaps "sky" or "falling from top" objects); "oranges" [4,6] to 5 if top- or left-visible (side-exposed). But in train2 (bg=9), 9 is treated as green but is actually bg in expected, causing overpainting. 2's handled specially only for bg=8.
 * Subtleties: Do not paint bg itself (e.g., in train2, 9 stays 9); 0's on borders are "open" and stay 0 if not enclosed, but enclosed 0's become 5. Components must ignore bg and 0 in connectivity. Bottom-touch in bg=8 uses a fixed offset (n-3), which might miss if grid size varies or "bottom" means stricter (e.g., i == n-1). Flood seeds {1,3,5} suggest painting after initial repaints to propagate "influence." Diagonal connectivity can merge objects unexpectedly. In train1, some 0's stay 0 in expected (open spaces), but generated fills them wrongly. No handling for other colors (e.g., 5 in input?).
 * Easy-to-miss: After repainting components, re-run floods on the updated grid (out), as new 3/5 can seed further fills. But in code, flood_from_seeds runs before fill_enclosed_zeros, which uses original g for flooding (bug: should use out?). Visited in floods must reset per call. For bg!=8, no bottom-touch logic, but train3 suggests similar positioning rules for other colors.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it fails all training examples due to incorrect color grouping and overpainting (e.g., treats input 9 as "green" object in train2, but 9 is bg and should stay unchanged).
 * For train1 (bg=8): Generated correctly paints some bottom 2's to 3 (e.g., row14 col4-5, row15 col4-5 match expected), and some 5's on right (e.g., row3 col16-17), but wrongly paints extra 3's (row13 col10-11 as 3,3 but expected 3,3? Wait, row13 expected has 3,3 at col10-11? No—generated has 3,3 there but expected has them lower; actually, generated fills too many 0's to 5 (e.g., row3 col14=5 but expected=0; row6 col2=5 but expected=0; row8 col2=5 but expected=8? No, row8 col3=5 expected 0), leaving open 0's filled instead of staying 0. Bottom 2's in row8-9 col12-13 stay 2 in generated but expected painted? Unknown why—perhaps touches_bottom misses them (i=7,8 < n-3=15? n=18, n-3=15, so i=7<15 misses). Flood overfills enclosed/open distinction.
 * For train2 (bg=9): Generated paints almost entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., top row all 3's but expected mostly 9's with some 5/3), treating bg=9 as object and flooding everything; no preservation of bg or correct components (e.g., expected keeps 9's as bg, paints specific 3/4/6/7 areas differently). Color groups wrong—9 should not be in "greens."
 * For train3 (bg=7? Expected shows 7 as bg): Generated uses 3 as pseudo-bg? (all borders 3, but paints inner to 5/3), but expected uses 7 as bg and selectively paints (e.g., row1 col2-3=3,3 expected but generated row1 all 3's; row4 col2=5 expected but generated=3; bottom row17-18=2,2 expected but generated all 3's). Overpaints bg and ignores correct visibility (e.g., some 1/6 components not painted right). Component extraction likely merges wrongly due to wrong target_vals.
 * extract_components is essential and seems correct (8-connected BFS works for blobs).
 * touches_bottom is partially helpful but broken for non-strict bottom (n-3 too loose, misses mid-bottom objects in train1).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is unhelpful/broken: Overfloods 0's to 5 without respecting enclosure (e.g., fills open spaces in train1 that should stay 0); seeds {1,3,5} too broad post-repaint.
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is helpful but misused: Called on original g after floods, but should integrate better (e.g., flood on updated out); in train1, it leaves some enclosed 0's unfilled wrongly.
 * Overall: No adaptation for varying bg (hardcodes greens/oranges assuming bg!= those); program ignores input colors like 5/7 properly in non-8 cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It floods massive border areas to 5 (e.g., entire top/bottom/left/right rows/columns are 5's, suggesting bg=5? But input not provided—assuming bg !=5, this overpaints bg/objects). Inner structures show partial logic (e.g., horizontal 3's in rows 2-3 cols2-22 look like a top-visible "green" bar painted to 3; vertical 4's in cols13-21 rows4-25 seem like orange components painted/kept? But mixed with 1's and 9's that should perhaps be repainted). However, large 5-flooded regions (e.g., rows 0-1 all 5's, right cols22-29 all 5's) likely wrongly fill open space instead of preserving 0's or bg; enclosed areas (e.g., potential holes in the 4/1/9 structures) may not be filled to 5 correctly, as some 1/9 persist inside. 9's appear in lower middle (rows12-15 cols13-15,21-23), suggesting unreached "greens" but if bg!=9, this mismatches. Without input, hard to confirm, but it doesn't match expected patterns from trains (e.g., should have more 0's for open space, selective 3/5 only on visible components); looks like overflooding similar to train failures, missing enclosure distinction and bg preservation. To handle test, need better bg-adaptive color groups (e.g., exclude bg from objects) and stricter visibility/flood rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to transform a colored grid by identifying the background, detecting connected components (blobs or objects) of non-background colors, preserving large or key structures (including potential holes), and selectively modifying small components based on their position relative to the grid's center, while leaving holes (often color 0) intact and applying specific color changes (e.g., to green=3 or orange=5) for certain small blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is reliably the most frequent color in the flattened grid; do not change it (e.g., no observed shifts from magenta to yellow in examples).
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); use bounding boxes (bbox) and positions to determine size, location (e.g., midpoint relative to grid center at n/2, m/2), and whether they are "large" (e.g., threshold like >20 or half the max size) or small—large ones must stay unchanged, including any with holes.
 * Holes appear as color 0 within objects; they should remain 0 (not filled with 5 or other colors), as seen in expected outputs where 0's persist in interiors while surrounding colors may change.
 * Small components (size < threshold) change color based on position: top (mid_r < center_r) often to 3 (green), left/bottom to 5 (orange), but only for non-hole, non-large blobs—subtle rule may involve quadrant or relative positioning, and not all small blobs change (e.g., some stay original if right/bottom).
 * No changes to numbers or representations within objects; preserve shapes but recolor small isolated blobs.
 * Components with holes (e.g., enclosed 0's) are treated as single units—do not modify internals unless specified; large holed components are unchanged.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, test 30x30); rules must scale without hardcoding.
 * Subtle: Some small blobs in bottom-left quadrants change to 3 in train1 expected (not 5), suggesting position rules may prioritize vertical over horizontal or have exceptions for certain colors/origins.
 * All non-background colors are considered for components, but bg=8/9/7/4 in examples—exclude bg from component search.
 * Potential for multiple components of same color; track individually by bbox/position.

                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:

                        'color': color,
                        'positions': positions,

```
(This is helpful and mostly correct; it accurately detects components, sizes, and bbox for positioning—essential for identifying small vs. large and locations. Use DFS/stack for efficiency on large grids like test 30x30.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3) and finds connected components via 4-connectivity, which works for blob detection.
 * change_small_components_based_on_position partially understands position-based recoloring (uses center and midpoints), but misapplies: fills holes (0) with 5 incorrectly (expected keeps 0's as holes); changes some small blobs to 3/5 but wrong ones (e.g., train1 generated swaps 5's and 0's in right-side holes, adds extra 5's where expected has 0's, and puts 3's only in bottom where expected has them but misses top/left specifics).
 * keep_large_holed_component_unchanged is a good idea but broken—does nothing useful, as it just copies grid; needs to explicitly detect/ preserve holed/large components (e.g., by checking enclosed 0's or size > threshold).
 * change_background_color is unhelpful and broken—does nothing but comments suggest irrelevant magenta-to-yellow change not seen in any examples (ignore/discard it).
 * program overall structure is helpful (bg -> components -> modify small -> output), but thresholds like size >20 or >= large/2 are arbitrary and fail: train1 large blob (e.g., the '8' shape) preserved but small holes filled wrong; train2 top blobs changed to 3/7 instead of expected 5/3/4 swaps; train3 left blobs partially preserved but small 3's/5's not recolored correctly (e.g., generated keeps some 3's as-is where expected changes to 5/2/6).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has 5's in hole positions (e.g., row3 col15=5 vs expected 0; row8 col11=0 missing); bottom blobs changed to 3's correctly in some spots but adds extra 5's; overall, too many changes to small/right components.
 * Train2 mismatches: top row1 has 3,7,7,3 vs expected 5,3,3,5 (wrong colors for small top/left blobs); row3 col13=3 vs expected 4; mid changes like row10 col4=5 vs expected 4 (fills wrong).
 * Train3 mismatches: row2 has 3's unchanged where expected changes some to 5; row4 col2=6 unchanged but expected 5; bottom row17/18 has 5's where expected 2's; misses hole preservation and position-specific changes (e.g., left small to 5, but generated keeps originals).
 * Function change_small_components_based_on_position is partially helpful for position logic but broken for holes/color rules (don't fill 0's; refine thresholds/conditions).
 * No attempt handles hole detection (e.g., count enclosed 0's in bbox); add to components dict for 'holes' to preserve large holed ones.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it arbitrarily changes small clusters of 1's, 3's, and 5's (e.g., top-mid 3's and 1's mostly preserved but some 1's in row5-8 changed to 4's? Wait, no—generated shows many original 1's/3's/5's intact but scatters 5's into positions like row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where input likely has different, and fills some apparent holes/spaces inconsistently.
 * It seems to apply position rules poorly: e.g., upper-left 3's/1's partially changed (row3-4 col2-5=3's kept, but row16-18 bottom 5's added where input has 5's already?); lower-right 1's/3's modified to 4's in scattered ways, but without clear quadrant logic—looks like over-changing small components without preserving shapes/holes (e.g., row22 col20-21=1,1 added/changed vs input).
 * Missing key: no evident hole preservation (if input has 0's, likely filled); changes don't align with train patterns (e.g., no consistent top-to-3 or left-to-5); overall, output looks like noisy recoloring rather than structured puzzle solution—probably wrong because it fails on similar position/size logic as trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or "tiles" of the same color) must be identified and selectively recolored based on structural rules like size, position, adjacency to background, and relationships to larger elements (e.g., a "frame"). The goal is to transform an input grid into a target output by applying color changes (e.g., to 3/green or 5/orange) to specific small components while leaving others unchanged, with the background color (often 8, 9, 7, or 4) remaining dominant.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; the code uses these directions but adds diagonals in some checks, which may overcount adjacency).
 * Small tiles are defined narrowly (≤4 pixels, bounding box ≤2x2), but this may miss some targets if they are slightly larger or irregularly shaped; expected outputs show small groups (1-4 pixels) being recolored, but not all.
 * A "large frame" is hypothesized as a big enclosing component (19-86 pixels, span 10-15), but this criterion fails to consistently identify the relevant structure across examples—e.g., in Train 1, the frame seems vertical/horizontal borders, but the rule doesn't trigger correctly.
 * Overlap with frame: Only changes small tiles of the same color as the frame if overlap ≥0.5, but this doesn't match expectations (e.g., Train 1 expects some 0s and 1s to stay or change differently, not to 5).
 * Lower position: Tiles in the bottom half (center_y ≥ n/2) that are adjacent to background (including diagonals) and not frame-colored change to 3, but this over-applies (e.g., Train 1 generates extra 3s in bottom where expected has 5s or 0s) and misses upper placements.
 * Zero-filling: Small 0-components adjacent to background change to 5, but this interacts poorly with other rules (applied after, so overrides might miss cases).
 * Background is top-left cell, assumed uniform, but grids have consistent borders (e.g., 8 in Train 1, 9 in Train 2).
 * Order of rules matters: Overlap first, then lower position, then zeros— but this sequence causes cascading errors (e.g., a tile changed to 5 early skips green rule).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes diagonals in some checks, but may not for component finding; zeros (0) are treated specially but may represent "empty" small tiles needing context-specific colors; not all small tiles change—some stay original (e.g., 1s, 2s in expectations); large components (e.g., frames) must not be altered; grids are square (18x18, 15x15, 20x20), but test is 30x30—scale rules accordingly.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected changes are to 5 in upper areas (not just lower), suggesting position rule is inverted or conditional; Train 3 shows symmetric changes (e.g., 1s to nothing, but 3s expand); colors like 1,2,6 may be "noise" or fixed; no rule for propagating colors between similar components.
 * All rules assume one large frame, but examples may have multiple large structures or none; pixel counts and bbox spans are heuristics that don't fit all (e.g., Train 2's frame seems irregular).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it fails all three training examples by applying incorrect color changes based on flawed rule heuristics.
 * Train 1: Generated changes several upper small tiles (e.g., positions around row 2-3, col 7-10 from 0/8 to 5; row 3 col 14-15 from 8 to 5) where expected keeps 0s or changes to other colors; bottom greens (3s) are placed too broadly (e.g., row 9-15 col 3-4 are 3s, but expected has 1s there initially changing differently); zeros filled to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 3 col 9 stays 0 in expected but becomes 5? Wait, no—generated has 0s in places expected has 5s, like row 3 col 16); overall, too many 5s in mid-upper, missing 5s in right column (e.g., row 3-9 col 16 expected 5, generated 0/8).
 * Train 2: Generated keeps some 7s as 3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 col 7-8 to nothing, but expected 5/3; row 7 col 7-8 stay 3 but expected 7); changes bottom 3s too early (row 9-14 col 2-3 to 3, expected 7/4); misses frame overlap (e.g., left frame 4s not propagating to 5); small tiles like row 0 col 6-9 expected 5/3 but generated 4/7; unknown why adjacency rule skips some lower 7s to 3 when expected keeps them.
 * Train 3: Generated fails to change upper 1s/6s to 5/3 (e.g., row 1 col 2-3 stay 1, expected 3; row 8-9 col 1-2 stay 6/5? Expected has 5s expanding left); bottom 3s over-applied (row 10-16 col 7-8 to 3/1, but expected 1/6); frame (background 7) adjacency changes zeros/ smalls wrong (no zeros here, but small 1s/2s not recolored correctly); misses symmetric left-side changes (e.g., row 7-10 col 1 to 5 in expected, generated 6).
 * Rule_orange_from_frame_overlap is broken/not helpful: Triggers too few/often on wrong color matches, missing cases where non-same-color tiles need orange.
 * Rule_green_from_lower_position over-applies to non-adjacent tiles and skips upper ones that need green/orange.
 * Rule_fill_small_zeros helps partially (fills some 0s to 5 adjacent to bg), but interacts badly (e.g., Train 1 fills upper 0s to 5 where expected keeps 0 or changes later).
 * Rule_stabilize_large_frame is unhelpful/irrelevant: Does nothing, but large components need protection—consider expanding to avoid any large changes.
 * Find_large_frame is flawed: Pixel/span ranges don't capture irregular frames (e.g., Train 3's vertical bars not 10-15 span); may return None, skipping rules.
 * Overall, component extraction works (find_components correctly identifies blobs), but rule logic demonstrates poor understanding—changes don't align with patterns like "fill gaps in frames" or "color based on enclosure."

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It appears to copy the input almost unchanged (e.g., all 1s, 9s, 0s stay as-is, no recoloring observed in the printed grid), suggesting rules failed to trigger (e.g., no 3s or 5s added, despite small 0s/1s tiles present like row 8 col 6-8 0s adjacent to 4 bg; upper 9s/1s not changed to frame-like 5). This mismatches puzzle intent, as trainings show small tiles (e.g., 0s,1s) should recolor to 3/5 based on position/adjacency—here, lower 0s (row 19-21 col 21-23) stay 0, upper 1s stay 1. Likely, large_frame detection fails on the 30x30 scale (borders are 4, but inner structures like horizontal 9s/1s bars may not fit 19-86 pixels), and small_tile filter misses some (e.g., the 7-pixel 1s in row 2-4 col 5-11). No changes mean the program didn't apply rules effectively, making output senseless for the puzzle—expect more 5s in frame-overlaps (e.g., inner 1s bars) and 3s in lower isolated tiles.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where regions of uniform colors represent connected components (blobs) that must be recolored based on structural rules, likely modeling plant-like objects such as leaves (colored 3), stems or branches (colored 5), flowers or centers (possibly 1 or 2), and empty spaces (0), while preserving the background color (b, e.g., 8, 9, 7, 4) and avoiding recoloring irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (b) is the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test); never recolor it, and use it to define "non-background" for adjacency checks.
 * Identify 2x2 squares of the same non-b, non-0 color c; recolor them to 3 (green/leaves) only if they have horizontal adjacency to a non-b, non-c cell (subtle: check left/right for each of the 4 cells in the square, but code checks only horizontal, missing vertical/diagonal adjacencies that might be required).
 * Stem color is the first non-b, non-3 color (including 0) that is 4-way adjacent to any 3; then recolor entire connected components (4-way) of that stem color to 5 if the component is in the same row as a 3 OR 8-way adjacent to a 3 (subtle: components must satisfy both conditions in some cases, but code uses OR, leading to over-coloring; also, prioritize "first" stem by iterating used colors + 0).
 * For blue (hardcoded as 1), recolor 0-components (4-way connected) to 5 if attached 4-way to blue AND have at least one upward (north) neighbor that is blue (subtle: "upward attachment" means specifically checking above each cell in the component, not just any attachment).
 * Isolated single 0 cells (size-1 components with no 4-way adjacent non-b) get recolored to 5 (subtle: count adjacencies correctly during flood-fill, but code increments adj_non_b per neighbor, which may overcount if shared).
 * 0 represents empty/fillable space; it can act as a stem or be colored based on attachments, but not all 0s are recolored—only those meeting criteria (subtle: some 0s remain 0 if not isolated or not attached properly, e.g., in training 1 expected has many 0s unchanged).
 * Connected components are 4-way for flooding (up/down/left/right), but 8-way for some attachment checks to 3 (subtle: inconsistency in code's directions usage can miss diagonal touches).
 * Colors like 2,6 may represent petals or other elements; they aren't recolored in this attempt but appear in expectations (e.g., training 1 has 2s unchanged, training 2 has 6s, training 3 has 2s and 6s).
 * Order matters: Color 3s first, then stems to 5, then blue-attached 0s to 5, then isolated 0s to 5 (subtle: later steps may overwrite earlier ones if not careful, e.g., a 0 stem colored to 5 could conflict).
 * Grids vary in size (18x18 for training 1/3, 15x15 for 2, 30x30 for test); ensure n=len(g) handles all.
 * Subtle miss: In qualifying 2x2 for 3, adjacency check is flawed—code only checks horizontal left/right for the square's cells, but expectations suggest broader "exposed" or "leaf-like" criteria (e.g., not fully enclosed).
 * 0 can be part of larger structures but only recolored if criteria met; many 0s in expectations remain 0, indicating not all empties are stems or isolations.
 * Blue=1 interactions are specific to "upward" (vertical above), suggesting directionality like growth from base.
 * No recoloring of other colors (e.g., 2,6 stay as-is in expectations).

    s: Set[int] = set()
    for row in grid:

directions8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]
```
These are useful for validation, color extraction, and adjacency (4-way for components, 8-way for attachments). The color_qualifying_squares function is partially helpful for 2x2 detection but broken in adjacency logic (only horizontal checks, misses cases). Flood-fill with stack for components is good but needs better condition checks (e.g., for has_same_row and attached_to_green).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of rules.
 * Training 1: Generated over-colored many areas to 3 and 5 (e.g., bottom-right 3s and 5s where expected has 3s but keeps 0s and 2s unchanged; top-left 2x2 became 3 but expected keeps as 2; isolated 0s partially colored to 5 but some 5s appear where expected has 0s or 2s; stem logic misidentified, coloring extra 5s in rows without proper attachment).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Expected has 2s in top-left and bottom-left unchanged, many 0s preserved (e.g., vertical chains of 0s next to 2s stay 0, not 5); generated has 3s there and extra 5s (e.g., row 3 col 16-17 as 5 but expected 5 only in specific spots); unknown why stem=2 wasn't chosen correctly, leading to wrong 5 placements.
 * Training 2: Generated colored some 0s/empties to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 11-12 as 5 but expected 6; row 5 col 0 as 5 but expected 4; bottom 7s partially to 5 but expected keeps 7s); 3s correct in some 2x2 but missed propagating to adjacent 6s or 4s; blue=1 logic absent, so no upward 0 coloring; over-colored stems without row/adjacency checks.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Expected has 6s as a separate component (possibly petals) unchanged, 4s in specific chains, 7s at bottom; generated has 5s overwriting potential 6/4/7 areas (e.g., row 7 col 0 as 5 but expected 4); subtle: missed that some 3s attach to non-stem colors like 6, not coloring them to 5.
 * Training 3: Generated under-colored some areas (e.g., row 4 col 13-14 as 3 but expected 2; row 5 col 12 as 6 but expected 2; many 1s and 6s unchanged correctly but 5s over-applied in left column); stem logic colored extra 5s (e.g., row 10 col 14 as 5 but expected 6 or unchanged); isolated 0s not present, but blue=1 attachments missed upward specificity.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Expected has 2s in mid-left (rows 4-5 col 13-14) as a distinct element, 6s in chains (e.g., row 11 col 6-7 as 1 but wait, expected has 1s there? No, generated has 3s where expected 1/6; unknown why 2x2 detection failed for certain colors); 5s in top but generated spreads them incorrectly.
 * Overall: 2x2 to 3 works in some spots (e.g., training 1 top 3s) but over-applies without proper adjacency; stem selection picks wrong color (e.g., colors 0 as stem instead of 2); 0 to 5 rules partial (isolated good, but blue-upward misses directionality, and components over-colored if OR instead of AND); no handling for other colors like 2/6 as potential centers/petal unchanged.
 * Function color_qualifying_squares is partially helpful but broken (adjacency only horizontal, should be broader exposure check); get_used_colors and flood-fill stack are essential and correct for components.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but hardcoded blue=1 limits generality (if blue varies, fails); visited matrices reset per rule is good but inefficient for large grids like test.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3s in long horizontal/vertical lines (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 3-11 and 15-21 as solid 3s, but likely input has sparse colors needing only specific 2x2 qualified; this suggests 2x2 detection generalized wrongly to lines, not just squares).
 * Many 5s appear in scattered spots (e.g., row 8 col 6-7,9 as 5/0/5, but 0 remains—isolated rule partial; row 10 col 6-8 as 5s where possibly stem but over-colored without row match).
 * 1s and 9s preserved in clusters (good for unchanged elements), but 0s like row 8 col 7 remain 0 (correct if not isolated/attached), yet surrounding 5s suggest missed component merging.
 * Bottom sections (rows 18-25) have 5s in row 18-20 col 21-23, possibly from isolated 0s or stems, but chains of 1s and 9s unchanged—looks plausible for attachments but likely incorrect due to training failures (e.g., no upward blue checks visible, and 3s in row 25 col 13-15 may be wrong 2x2).
 * Overall, test output has too many 3s (line-filling instead of square-specific) and partial 5s, missing preservation of 0s/2-like elements; doesn't make sense as a "plant" structure—appears noisy, not structured like expectations' clean components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to classify and recolor connected components (blobs) of specific colors based on rules like visibility from edges (top, left, right), size, position (e.g., near bottom or top rows), and background color, then flood-filling empty spaces (0's) with 5's starting from seed colors like 1,3,5,7,9 using 8-connectivity. The goal is to produce a modified grid where certain blobs are changed to 3 (green-like) or 5 (orange-like or fill), while preserving others, and ensuring the fill propagates correctly without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is determined from g[0][0] and excludes certain colors from processing (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} - {bg}).
 * Components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals), which is crucial for blob shapes but can merge unexpectedly if not handled.
 * Visibility rules: Top-visible if any cell in component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; left-visible if no blockers left in row; right-visible similarly but checking right side (note: right-visible check in code looks for blockers to the right, but logic may invert intent).
 * Size and position filters: For green (1,7,9), skip if >4 cells; use bounding box height/width (h,w) where w > h or (h==w and top position <=2 and not right-visible) triggers change to 3. For orange (4,6), skip if >6 cells or min row >3; change to 5 if top- or left-visible.
 * Special case for bg==8: Change bottom-touching 2-components to 3, but only if they touch near bottom (i >= n-5, which is arbitrary and may miss subtle bottom definitions).
 * Flood fill starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and spreads to adjacent 0's with 5, using 8-connectivity and visited to avoid revisits, but seeds themselves are not changed (only propagate from them).
 * Empty cells (0's) remain 0 unless filled; non-seed colors like 2,4,6 may stay or change based on rules.
 * Subtle: Flood fill uses directions including diagonals, but only fills 0's; it marks visited but sets to 5 immediately, which could block further spread if not careful. Also, components of size 1-4 for green or <=6 for orange with visibility/position are targeted, but over-application can change non-target blobs.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, 30x29?), so n,m dynamic; bottom-touching defined loosely (e.g., last 5 rows).
 * Potential misses: Right-visibility may be overused or inverted; flood fill seeds include changed colors (3,5), so order matters (changes before fill). No handling for vertical/horizontal dominance beyond w>h. Components must be fully connected; isolated cells count as components.

(Flood fills 0's from seeds using BFS with 8-connectivity; works but seeds propagate immediately from neighbors, which is correct if seeds are unchanged.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated incorrectly changed left-side 2-blob cells (rows 3-7, cols 2-3) to 5 instead of leaving as 0/2, over-applied orange rules or flood; bottom 2's (rows 14-15, cols 10-11) correctly to 3, but some 5's in cols 14-16 overfilled where expected 0's; right 1's stayed 1 (correct), but flood missed some 0's turning to 5.
 * In training example 1, special bg=8 rule for bottom 2's worked partially (changed to 3), but green/orange rules over-applied to non-visible or large components, e.g., vertical structure in cols 9-10 got 5's where expected 0's.
 * In training example 2 (bg=9), generated kept some 5's and 3's correctly top-left but failed on right-side 6's (row2 col11-12 as 5 instead of 6, row3 col13 as 5? Wait, expected has 6,6,4 so under-changed); orange 4/6 blobs in rows5-6 cols1-3 stayed 4/6 (correct) but flood over-applied 5's in row1 col6? No major flood issue, but component extraction missed splitting or visibility for mid-grid 6's.
 * In training example 2, green 3's top-left correct, but size filter skipped some small components incorrectly; right-bottom 7's stayed 7 (correct, as non-green/orange), but a 5 in row1 col10 incorrect (expected 9? bg).
 * In training example 3 (bg=7), generated under-applied 5's to left 6-blob (rows1-2 cols4-5 as 3? No, as 6, but expected 5's for top parts); over-kept 6's in rows3-9 col2-3 where expected 5's in some; bottom 2's stayed 2 (correct); 1's stayed 1 (correct, perhaps non-target).
 * In training example 3, touches_bottom not triggered correctly for some, and visibility (top/left) missed for horizontal dominance; flood fill under-applied, leaving some 0's? But outputs show no 0's visible, differences in 3 vs 5 for 6-blobs.
 * extract_components is helpful and seems correct (8-connectivity matches blob shapes in diffs).
 * has_top_visible, has_left_visible, has_right_visible are essential but right_visible logic checks for no blockers to right (meaning visible from right edge?), which may be inverted—generated often fails when right-visible should block change.
 * flood_fill_from_seeds works for propagation but starts only from seeds' neighbors, not overwriting seeds; in trains, it overfills some 0's to 5 where expected 0 (e.g., train1 left structure).
 * Special bg==8 rule partially worked (bottom 2 to 3) but applied too broadly; general green/orange rules too aggressive on size/position (e.g., min_i <=3 too loose, len>4 skip misses small visible).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but touches_bottom with fixed -5 is heuristic and not general (breaks for varying grid heights).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (30x29? grid, bg=4) has many 5's already placed (e.g., row8 cols6-8 as 5,5,5; row19-21 cols21-23 as 5's), suggesting pre-flood changes, but looks over-filled—e.g., scattered 5's in row8 col6-8 may be from orange rule on 5? Input has 5's? Wait, the "generated output" includes original colors like 9's,1's,4's unchanged in places, with some 5's added (e.g., row8), but no visible 0's left, implying flood filled everything adjacent to seeds.
 * Test output does not look fully correct: It preserves large 1-blobs (e.g., rows3-4 cols5-12 as 1's, expected perhaps change to 3 if small/visible green), but adds 5's in isolated spots like row8 cols6-8 (possibly erroneous flood from nearby 5? Input has 5 there? No, input not given, but output has them as 5 while surrounding 1's/4's); bottom rows have 5's in row19-21 cols21-23, which may be correct fill but over-spreads to row22 col21 as 1? Wait, row22 has 1's.
 * Test output misses potential 3-changes for top 9/1 blobs (rows2-3 cols2-5,14-21 as 9/1, visible from top/left but stayed, violating green rule if size<=4); flood seems to have filled some but left paths open incorrectly (e.g., row12 col24-26 as 9's, possibly unfilled 0's? But output shows no 0's, all filled or colored).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (fills from seeds like 1,5,9 to 5 in empties), but incorrect due to unchanged green-like blobs (1,9) that should be 3 if visible/small, and possible over-change of 4's to 5 without position check; looks like rules applied but visibility/size thresholds wrong, leading to under-classification.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs/objects) of specific colors in a background grid, evaluate their visibility from edges (top, left, right, bottom), and transform them to new colors (e.g., 3 or 5) based on shape ratios (width vs height), visibility conditions, and background-specific rules, before performing a flood fill from certain seed values (odd numbers like 1,3,5,7,9) to fill empty (0) spaces with 5, likely simulating some kind of object occlusion or rendering in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals) groups of the same non-background, non-zero value; empty spaces are 0.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0]; exclude bg from consideration for changes, and visibility checks ignore bg and 0.
 * For "green" colors (1,7,9 if not bg): Change to 3 if top-visible and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)).
 * For "orange" colors (4,6 if not bg): Change to 5 if (top or left visible) and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)); subtle: this seems to target horizontal-ish bars or protrusions.
 * Special case if bg==8: Change 2-components to 3 if bottom-visible (perhaps shadows or ground-level objects).
 * Flood fill: Starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9}, spreads to adjacent 0s (8 directions) filling with 5, but only if not visited; subtle: this might simulate filling hidden/empty areas behind visible objects, but it can overfill if seeds are misplaced.
 * Visibility: A component is "top-visible" if any cell has no non-bg/non-0 above it in the same column; similar for left (same row left), right (same row right), bottom (below).
 * Subtleties: Changes use a dict to avoid overwriting; components must be non-empty; shape ratio uses bounding box (min/max i/j +1 for h/w); easy to miss: visibility is per-cell then any in component, and changes only if do_change condition met; flood fill uses BFS but seeds include post-change values, so order matters (changes before fill); bg can be colors like 4,8,9 affecting which are "greens/oranges"; no diagonal-only connections—full 8-way; potential over-changing if multiple rules overlap; empty grid areas stay bg unless filled.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle variable grid sizes; ensure copy_grid preserves original; visited prevents re-flood; but flood seeds include 5 which might self-propagate if adjacent to 0; rules seem asymmetric (favor horizontal changes, right/bottom less prioritized); test inputs may have no 0s initially, so fill only creates if changes introduce them? No—changes replace to 3/5, fill only targets existing 0s; subtle miss: expected outputs have 0s where generated has 5/3, suggesting changes should introduce 0s or not fill certain areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) passed Training example 3 (correct output matched), showing core component extraction, visibility, and flood fill work in some cases.
 * Failed Training 1: Generated filled areas with 5 and changed to 3 where expected has 0s and 2/5; specifically, upper blob (likely 2?) changed incorrectly to 3/5 instead of keeping/changing to 2 with 0s for hidden parts; flood fill over-applied 5 to what should be 0s; bottom 3s correct, but side 1s unchanged correctly; unknown why 2 not handled as special (bg=8 rule applied but wrong visibility?).
 * Failed Training 2: Generated kept some 5/3 but misplaced 4/6 vs expected (e.g., row 5 col 1-2: generated 5,5 expected 4,6; row 12 col 5: generated 4 expected 4 but surrounding mismatches); changes to 5/3 over-applied to vertical-ish components; flood fill didn't create 0s, but expected has no 0s—issue is wrong color swaps (e.g., 6s became 5?); bg=9, so greens=1,7 but input has 3,5,6,4,7—3 not changed, but oranges=4,6 changed wrong.
 * extract_components is essential and correct (used successfully in the correct example 3).
 * Visibility functions are helpful but subtle bug: they check per-cell but return if ANY visible, which is correct, but in train1, top_vis likely true but do_change wrong for vertical blobs.
 * Flood fill is mostly helpful but unhelpful in cases with no 0s (does nothing, correct) or overfills post-change seeds; in train1, it filled what should be 0s (perhaps changes didn't introduce 0s, but expected has them—suggests rule should set some to 0 instead of 3/5).
 * Changes dict avoids overlaps, helpful; greens/oranges filtering by !=bg is key but missed if bg in list (e.g., train2 bg=9 not in lists).
 * Overall: Partial rules for horizontal changes work (why example 3 passed), but vertical/square components not distinguished well; special bg=8 rule applied in train1 but wrong (changed 2 to 3, but expected kept 2 with 0s); no handling for keeping 0s or other colors like 2/5 unchanged.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have minimally changed the input (kept most 1,3,5,9 components as-is or swapped some 1/9 to 3 under rules), with no 0s introduced and flood fill doing nothing (since no 0s in input and changes don't create them), resulting in a grid full of 4(bg),1,3,5,9 without occlusions or empties.
 * Expected likely includes 0s in hidden areas (e.g., behind vertical 1s or 9s, similar to train1 where 0s represent occluded space), and possibly more changes to 5 for oranges (but bg=4, so oranges=6 only if present—input has none?); e.g., the large horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 stayed 3 (correct if not green), but vertical 9s in col 21-23 rows 5-20 probably should be partially 0 or changed if not top-visible; side 5s in row8 col6-8 stayed, but if left-visible and wide, should be 5? Wait, already 5; overall, lacks 0s where components overlap shadows, and flood fill missed because no seeds hit 0s—suggests rules need to set some component parts to 0 for depth/occlusion, not just color swap; unknown exact diffs without input grid, but output looks too "filled" vs expected sparse 0s in trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 10:46:06] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where components (connected groups of cells with the same non-background value) are identified and recolored based on visibility from the left or top edges, with special rules for certain backgrounds (e.g., bg=8 treats bottom 2's as 3's), followed by vertical downward filling and connected flooding to propagate color 5 into empty (0) areas from seeds like 1,3,5. The goal appears to be rendering or "painting" visible structures and their shadows or fills correctly, leaving internal holes or occluded areas as 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells properly; 4-connected would split some objects incorrectly.
 * Visibility from left: A component is "visible" if any of its cells has no non-background/non-zero cells to its left in the same row.
 * Visibility from top: Similar, but checked column-wise upward; however, the current check is per-cell and may overcount if not aggregated properly.
 * Recoloring rules: Odds (except 5) to 3 if left-visible or (top-visible with specific row/width conditions like min_i <=1 and width=1, or min_i=2 and width>1); evens (non-2) to 5 under similar visibility. For bg=8, override bottom-touching 2's to 3 regardless.
 * Post-recoloring: Vertical fill downward from {1,3,5} seeds into 0's (column-wise, like gravity), then flood-fill (8-directional) from {3,5} into remaining 0's, but this seems to overfill occluded/hole areas that should stay 0.
 * Subtleties: Internal 0's (holes) must remain 0 even if floodable; visibility conditions are heuristic and fail for complex shapes (e.g., the width-based top-visibility hacks suggest trying to detect "protrusions" but miss multi-row objects). Background varies (8,9,7,4), and present colors include evens/odds but exclude bg and sometimes 2/5. Bottom-touching for special cases uses a threshold like n-4, which is arbitrary and may not generalize. Flooding ignores boundaries, leading to spillover into unintended areas. No handling for diagonal occlusions or layered visibility. Ensure out-grid starts as copy to preserve originals before modifications.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import collections

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]

def get_size(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return len(g)

def extract_components(g: List[List[int]], target_val: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n, m = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] == target_val:
                component = []
                queue = collections.deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                component.append((i, j))
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == target_val:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                            component.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This extracts 8-connected components for a specific value, essential for isolating objects.)

```python
def get_bbox(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    min_i = min(i for i, j in comp)
    max_i = max(i for i, j in comp)
    min_j = min(j for i, j in comp)
    max_j = max(j for i, j in comp)
    return min_i, max_i, min_j, max_j
```
(Computes bounding box for component analysis, like width for visibility heuristics.)

```python
def has_top_visible(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    for i, j in comp:
        visible = True
        for k in range(i):
            if g[k][j] != bg and g[k][j] != 0:
                visible = False
                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False

def has_left_visible(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    m = len(g[0])
    for i, j in comp:
        visible = True
        for l in range(j):
            if g[i][l] != bg and g[i][l] != 0:
                visible = False
                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False
```
(These check per-component visibility from top/left by testing if any cell in the component has a clear line of sight; useful but overly permissive as they return True if ANY cell is visible, potentially recoloring whole components incorrectly.)

```python
def touches_bottom(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return max((i for i, j in comp), default=-1) >= n - 4
```
(Checks if component reaches near bottom; the n-4 threshold is specific/heuristic and may need tuning.)

```python
def fill_vertical_down(out: List[List[int]], seeds: set, target: int):
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])
    for j in range(m):
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                i += 1
                while i < n and out[i][j] == 0:
                    out[i][j] = target
                    i += 1
            i += 1
```
(Fills 0's downward from seed columns; simulates gravity but doesn't stop at obstacles, leading to overfill.)

```python
def flood_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]], seeds: set, target: int):
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    queue = collections.deque()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                        out[ni][nj] = target
                        visited[ni][nj] = True
                        queue.append((ni, nj))
    while queue:
        i, j = queue.popleft()
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                out[ni][nj] = target
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(8-directional flood from seeds into 0's; helpful for connected fills but overfills closed holes and ignores visibility/occlusion.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by over-recoloring and over-filling 0 areas that should remain empty (holes or shadows).
 * Train 1 (bg=8): Generated incorrectly recolored internal 5's (e.g., row 3 col 9=5 vs expected 0; row 4 col 9=5 vs 0) and filled vertical/horizontal 5's into what should be 0 holes (e.g., row 8 col 10=5 vs 0); special bottom 2-to-3 worked partially but flood overdid it in columns 16-17. Visibility heuristics failed to leave central voids empty.
 * Train 2 (bg=9): Generated mismatched recoloring, e.g., top row col 7-8=7 (odds) stayed 7 but expected 3; row 1 col 3-4=3 (odds to 3) but row 0 col 7-8 should be 3 not 7; evens like 4 stayed but some 6's (evens) not recolored to 5 where visible; vertical fill from 3/5 overfilled unrelated areas (e.g., row 2 col 13=5 vs expected 4).
 * Train 3 (bg=7): Generated left some odds as 3 where expected 5 (e.g., row 1 col 4-9=6? Wait, 6 even but code treats evens non-2 to 5; actually row 1 col 4-5=3 vs expected 5, suggesting wrong source sets—odds to 3 but some should be 5?); under-recolored top structures (row 1-2 col 4-9 should be 5's but partial 3's); no overfill noted but mismatches in blob shapes (e.g., row 2 col 10-13=6 vs expected 5).
 * extract_components and visibility functions are essential and mostly correct but visibility logic (e.g., width conditions) is too rigid/heuristic, missing multi-part objects or diagonal views.
 * fill_vertical_down and flood_from_seeds are helpful for propagation but broken for this puzzle as they don't respect occlusions/holes—cause main errors by filling everything reachable.
 * Special bg=8 handling for bottom 2's is relevant but threshold (n-4) is arbitrary and may not catch all "bottom" cases.
 * Overall, source sets (odds to green_src=3, evens non-2 to orange_src=5) seem partially right but fail when colors like 5/2 are present or visibility is blocked subtly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=4) does not look correct; it over-recolors large horizontal 3's in rows 2-4 cols 2-22 (likely odds visible from left/top) but leaves some internals as 3 instead of filling to 5 or leaving 0; vertical fills propagate 5's downward in cols 6-8 (from row 8 5's) and flood 5's into scattered areas (e.g., row 9 col 22-24=9? Wait, 9's stay but nearby 1's flood to 5 incorrectly, like row 5 col 21=9 vs should probably stay if occluded). It mismatches expected behavior by filling holes (e.g., around the 1's and 9's clusters in rows 5-7, where isolated 0's get 5'd) and not handling the complex L-shapes/ protrusions properly—e.g., the bottom-right 5's in row 19-21 seem underfilled compared to training patterns. Without exact expected, it appears over-aggressive like training fails, missing subtle occlusions in the dense 3/1/5/9 layout.

[2025-10-03 10:46:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 11:11:35] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Detect the background color as the most frequent value in the grid."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    counts = Counter(flat)
    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0]

def fill_enclosed_zeros(g: List[List[int]], new_color: int = 5) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill all zeros with a new color (simple rule for enclosed or empty spaces)."""
    return [[new_color if cell == 0 else cell for cell in row] for row in g]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Compose rules to transform the grid: detect background and fill zeros with orange (5)."""
    # Note: This implements a basic rule inferred from training - fill empty spaces (0) with a new color.
    # For more complex recoloring, additional functions can be added based on further observations.
    _ = detect_background(g)  # Detect but not used in this simple version
    return fill_enclosed_zeros(g, 5)
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:12:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by numbers (colors), where the task appears to be transforming the grid by detecting the background color, identifying and selectively recoloring empty spaces (0s) that are enclosed or part of specific regions (likely via flood fill or connected components), and possibly recoloring certain existing shapes or objects based on structural rules like enclosure, connectivity, or topology (e.g., filling holes with one color like 5 and altering object colors like 2 to 3).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color (e.g., 8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3, 4 in test), and transformations should not alter it unless it's part of a rule.
 * Not all 0s are filled; only enclosed or bounded 0 regions seem to be targeted with a new color (e.g., 5), while open or boundary-touching 0s remain 0— the provided fill_enclosed_zeros function blindly fills all 0s, ignoring enclosure, which causes overfilling.
 * Existing non-zero colors are sometimes recolored based on context (e.g., in train1, bottom-left 2s become 3s in expected, suggesting a rule for certain object types like filled shapes or blobs; in train3, 1s and 6s get surrounded or altered to introduce 3s and 5s in specific patterns).
 * Connected components matter: shapes like blobs of 1s, 2s, or 6s may need extraction to determine if they enclose areas (e.g., train1 has 1s and 2s forming potential enclosures; train3 shows 1s and 6s with 5s filling inner areas and 3s for outer blobs).
 * Subtle topology: "Enclosed" likely means fully surrounded by non-background/non-zero cells, not touching the grid edge—missing this leads to filling edge-adjacent 0s incorrectly.
 * Color choices: New colors like 5 (orange?) for fills and 3 for certain objects are consistent across examples, but depend on input (e.g., 5 for holes, 3 for specific shapes).
 * Grid boundaries and padding: All examples have background borders; transformations preserve structure but alter internals—ensure no spillover.
 * Potential object rules: Blobs may be classified by size, shape, or holes (e.g., train1 bottom changes suggest a "key" or "object" recoloring if it has certain features like no holes).
 * Avoid global changes: The program ignores connectivity, so it fails on partial enclosures (e.g., train2 has scattered 3s and 5s in expected, suggesting selective blob recoloring around 4s,6s,7s).
 * Edge cases: Irregular shapes (train3's winding 1s and 6s) require robust connected component labeling; test input has complex interleaving of 1s,5s,9s, suggesting multiple enclosed regions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from collections import deque, Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Detect the background color as the most frequent value in the grid."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    counts = Counter(flat)
    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is useful for identifying the outer color to avoid filling background-adjacent 0s.)

```python
def find_enclosed_regions(g: List[List[int]], background: int, fill_color: int = 5) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Flood fill to identify and fill only 0 regions not touching the background or edges."""
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    output = [row[:] for row in g]
    
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    # Mark all background-touching 0s as "open" (don't fill)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] == 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                # Check if this 0 touches edge or background
                touches_open = False
                queue = deque([(r, c)])
                component = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    if (x == 0 or x == rows-1 or y == 0 or y == cols-1) or g[x][y] == background:
                        touches_open = True
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == 0 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                            component.append((nx, ny))
                if not touches_open:
                    # Fill enclosed component
                    for x, y in component:
                        output[x][y] = fill_color
    return output
```
(This would be an improvement over the broken fill_enclosed_zeros; it uses BFS flood fill to detect enclosed 0s. Not yet implemented in the program, but essential for selectivity.)

```python
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int, background: int) -> List[Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Extract connected components (blobs) of a specific color, ignoring background."""
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] == color and not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != background:
                component = set()
                queue = deque([(r, c)])
                visited[r][c] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.add((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                if component:  # Only add non-empty
                    blobs.append(component)
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for identifying and potentially recoloring specific objects like 2s to 3s or 1s/6s in train3; could classify by size or enclosure to decide recoloring.)

The original `fill_enclosed_zeros` is broken/not helpful (fills all 0s indiscriminately, ignoring enclosure/connectivity—do not use in future).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly fills all 0s with 5, which works partially for obvious empty spaces but fails by overfilling open/enclosed 0s that should remain 0 (e.g., train1 generated fills all 0s like in row3 col6/9/14 but expected keeps them as 0; also doesn't recolor 2s to 3s in bottom rows 13-15).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated introduces 5s everywhere 0 was (e.g., row4 col4/9/14 filled, but expected keeps 0 there); bottom 2s unchanged to 3s (unknown rule, perhaps for non-enclosed blobs); extra 5s in positions like row7 col3 where expected has 0.
 * Train2 mismatches: Minimal changes in generated (no 5s or 3s added, e.g., row0 col6-9 remain 4,7,7,4 but expected has 5,3,3,5—suggests input had 0s or needs blob recoloring around 7s/4s); generated ignores enclosures, leaving 7s/4s intact where 3s/5s expected (e.g., row1 col3-5: 7,7,4 vs expected 3,3,5).
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated fills some 0s with 5 but incorrectly (e.g., row1 col4-9: 6s unchanged but expected has 5s there? Wait, generated shows 6s, suggesting few 0s or wrong filling; row2 col10-13: 6s vs expected 5s; doesn't introduce 3s for top blobs like row1 col2-3: 1,1 vs expected 3,3); overfills or underfills enclosures around 1s/6s.
 * detect_background is correctly implemented but unused effectively (called but ignored in program).
 * No object extraction, so misses recoloring rules for blobs (e.g., 1s to 3s in train1/3, 7s to 3s? in train2).
 * Function `fill_enclosed_zeros` is incorrect and not relevant (too simplistic; causes all mismatches by non-selective filling—don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it indiscriminately fills presumed 0s with 5s (e.g., row8 col6-8: 5,5,5; row9 col6-8:5,5,5; scattered 5s in rows 10-11,19-21), but given the training failures, this likely overfills open regions (e.g., the interleaving 1s and 9s in rows 2-4 suggest complex enclosures that need selective filling, not global 5s; bottom rows 19-22 have 5s where probably enclosed holes, but unchanged 1s/9s may need recoloring to 3 or similar). Without expected, it doesn't make sense as a puzzle solution—ignores blob extraction (e.g., large 1-blobs in rows 2-3 col5-12/15-22 likely need surrounding or altering) and enclosure checks (edge 0s filled wrongly). To handle test, need flood fill for enclosures and blob classification for 1/9 changes.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 11:12:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

```python
from typing import List

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def fill_zeros(g: List[List[int]], color: int = 5) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[color if cell == 0 else cell for cell in row] for row in g]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy_grid(g)
    grid = fill_zeros(grid)
    return grid

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:23:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where input grids contain numbers representing colors or regions (e.g., 1-9 for shapes, 0 for empty/background spaces), and the goal is to process the grid to complete or correct patterns, likely by filling specific 0s with matching colors based on connected components or shape continuity while preserving or adjusting certain regions, and leaving some 0s as-is or changing mismatched numbers.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires identifying connected regions of the same number (blobs or shapes) and extending or filling adjacent 0s to complete those shapes, but not all 0s are filled—some must remain 0 to act as separators or backgrounds.
 * Existing non-zero numbers may need adjustment if they don't fit the pattern (e.g., in training example 1, some 2s become 3s; in example 2, 7s become 3s or 5s), suggesting rules for recoloring based on proximity or overall shape consistency.
 * Border/background is often a consistent number (e.g., 8 in example 1, 9 in example 2, 7 in example 3, 4 in test), which should not be altered, and inner patterns must respect shape boundaries without bleeding into borders.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes that span multiple rows/columns, avoiding over-filling that connects unrelated regions, and recognizing that some 0s are structural (e.g., gaps between shapes) and should stay 0.
 * Patterns often involve symmetric or repeating motifs (e.g., pairs like 1,1 or 2,2), and filling must propagate colors correctly without assuming a single filler value.
 * Consider grid dimensions varying (18x18 in ex1, 15x15 in ex2, 20x20 in ex3, 30x30? in test), so solutions must be general.
 * Key rule: Fill 0s only if they are enclosed or adjacent to a specific shape's color, but leave exposed or separating 0s as 0; also, detect and correct "intruder" numbers that belong to other shapes.

    """Safe deep copy of grid."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The previous program only copied the grid and blindly filled all 0s with a fixed color (5), which worked for preserving non-zero cells but failed completely by over-filling every empty space, ignoring shape-specific rules—e.g., in training example 1, it turned structural 0s into 5s (like positions that should stay 0) and didn't correct mismatched numbers like 2s to 3s.
 * No region detection or pattern analysis was attempted, leading to uniform filling that connected unrelated areas (e.g., in example 2, it filled with 5s but expected has 3s/5s in specific spots and kept some implicit 0s? but outputs show no 0s in generated, while expected has none visible but mismatches colors).
 * In training example 1, generated mismatched colors in lower regions (e.g., row 14 has 2,2 vs expected 3,3; many 5s where 0s should be, like row 2 col 7: 5 vs 0), and overfilled borders/edges incorrectly.
 * Training example 2: Generated used wrong filler (5s) and didn't adjust existing numbers (e.g., row 1 has 4,7,7,4 vs expected 5,3,3,5; row 2 has 7,7,4 vs 3,3,5), showing no understanding of shape completion.
 * Training example 3: Similar overfill with 5s where 0s or other colors like 3/5 should be (e.g., row 2 has 1,1,6,6,... vs expected 3,3,5,5,...; many positions like row 4 col 2: 6 vs 5), and failed to extend shapes properly.
 * The fill_zeros function is unhelpful and broken for this puzzle as it doesn't discriminate based on context—avoid using blanket fillers; instead, use region-based propagation.
 * copy_grid is helpful and correct for preserving input without mutation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not make sense and is clearly incorrect—it appears to fill most of the grid with 4s (likely the border color), but inserts existing patterns like 9s,1s,5s without proper completion or filling of 0s, resulting in fragmented shapes (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 1-runs broken by 9s and 4s, but no evident rule-based filling; row 8 has isolated 5s and 1s that don't connect logically).
 * It fails to fill or adjust 0s appropriately, as many positions seem unchanged or wrongly bordered (e.g., row 9 has 5,5,5 in middle but surrounded by 4s/1s without extension; lower rows have repeated 1,1 pairs but no color propagation to adjacent empties).
 * Unlike training examples, the test output doesn't even attempt a consistent filler (mixes 4,5,9,1 without pattern), suggesting the program wasn't applied correctly or is from an earlier mismatched attempt— it doesn't match any expected logic, as shapes like the 9-blocks and 1-runs look incomplete or unprocessed.
 * To handle the test, future programs must detect large border (4 here) vs inner shapes and fill 0s only within shape bounding boxes, avoiding the over-bordering seen.

[2025-10-03 11:23:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based patterns where numbers represent colors or object types (e.g., 1,2,3,5 for different elements, 8/7/9/4 likely for borders or backgrounds), and zeros indicate empty spaces that may or may not need filling based on rules. The goal appears to be transforming the input grid by applying color mappings, completing shapes, or filling specific regions while preserving empties in certain areas, rather than a uniform fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Zeros (empty spaces) are not always filled; in expected outputs, some remain 0 (e.g., scattered empties inside shapes in training example 1), suggesting selective filling based on proximity to objects, containment, or pattern completion—uniform filling with 5 (orange) overwrites these and fails.
 * Existing numbers sometimes change values (e.g., in training example 1, bottom-right 2,2 pairs become 3,3 in expected, while top 2,2 stay 2,2; in example 2, some 7's become 3's and 4's become 5's), indicating rule-based recoloring, possibly mapping colors by object type, size, or position (e.g., symmetric or mirrored changes).
 * Background/border values (8 in ex1, 9 in ex2, 7 in ex3, 4 in test) remain unchanged, but inner regions show pattern extensions or fills (e.g., in ex1, new 3,3 blocks appear where input might have had partials or empties; in ex3, 1,1 and 6,6 extend into 5's or 3's).
 * Shapes seem to be "objects" like blobs or lines (e.g., pairs of 1's, 2's, 6's), which may need extraction for analysis—rules could involve counting connected components, filling enclosed areas, or applying color swaps based on global patterns (e.g., orange 5 fills some but not all voids).
 * Subtle: Outputs maintain grid structure but alter internals; empties near borders or outside shapes stay 0, while those inside get filled (but not always with 5—e.g., ex1 has 0's inside what looks like a frame). Possible symmetry or mirroring (e.g., ex1 has mirrored 1,1 and 2,2 placements). Avoid over-filling, as it breaks expected 0 preservation. Consider object adjacency or flooding from seeds.
 * Across attempts (only one shown): No object extraction, so misses identifying regions; uniform fill ignores why some 0's stay (e.g., non-contiguous empties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid without modification—useful as a base for safe transformations."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Extract positions of connected regions (e.g., blobs of same number) using flood-fill; helpful for identifying objects to recolor or fill around.
    Assumes 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right). Returns list of (i,j) positions."""
    if g[start_i][start_j] != target_val:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    component = []
    stack = [(start_i, start_j)]
    visited[start_i][start_j] = True
    while stack:
        i, j = stack.pop()
        component.append((i, j))
        for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and not visited[ni][nj] and g[ni][nj] == target_val:
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                stack.append((ni, nj))
    return component
```

(Note: No other functions from the attempt are helpful; `fill_zeros_with_orange` is broken as it uniformly fills all 0's, ignoring selective rules, and should not be reused.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly copies the grid and fills all 0's with 5 (orange), which works for preserving non-zero values and borders but fails entirely on selective filling—e.g., in train1, it turns expected internal 0's (like row2 col7=0) into 5's, but expected keeps them 0; also mismatches recoloring (e.g., row14 col10-11=2,2 becomes 3,3 in expected, but attempt leaves as 2,2).
 * In train1, generated has extra 5's in places like row3 col6=5 (expected 0), and bottom 2,2 unchanged where expected has 3,3—difference unknown but likely due to missing color mapping for specific object types (e.g., bottom blobs are a different "color" class).
 * In train2, generated leaves some values like 7's and 4's unchanged (e.g., row1 col7-8=7,7 becomes 3,3 in expected), filling 0's with 5's incorrectly (e.g., row1 col6=5 in expected but was 0? Wait, input not shown, but output shows mismatches like row0 col6=4 in generated vs 5 in expected)—indicates no recoloring logic.
 * In train3, generated keeps 1's as 1's and 6's as 6's (e.g., row1 col2-3=1,1 unchanged, but expected has 3,3), and fills 0's with 5's where expected extends patterns differently (e.g., row2 col10-13=6,6,6,6 becomes 5,5,5,5)—suggests missing blob extension or type-based filling.
 * No extraction of objects, so can't identify why some regions (e.g., enclosed 0's) get filled vs. others stay empty; uniform approach misses all subtleties like color swaps (2->3, 1->3? patterns).
 * `fill_zeros_with_orange` is unhelpful/broken: it over-fills and ignores recoloring, leading to all training failures; do not reuse without conditions (e.g., only fill if adjacent to certain objects).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a near-copy of the input with 0's filled as 5's (e.g., row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where likely 0's were), but preserves input numbers like 9's,1's, and a single 5, while borders are 4's unchanged. This mismatches the pattern from training, where outputs involve recoloring (e.g., no 2->3-like changes here, and scattered 0's should likely remain in non-shape areas like inside the 9/1 frames). It looks incorrect because it doesn't complete or alter shapes (e.g., the 1,1 pairs and 9 blocks seem unextended, unlike train1's 3,3 additions); instead, it's just a lazy fill, ignoring why train examples needed specific changes. To fix, need rules for object detection (e.g., treat 1's as one type to extend/fill around) and handle larger grid (30 cols) with possible symmetry in the 9/1/5 regions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid transformation puzzle where input grids containing various numbers (representing colors or components like 0 for empty, 1 for blue, 2 for something else, etc.) are modified according to specific rules to produce output grids, likely involving selective filling of empties (0s) with orange (5), conditional color changes (e.g., blue 1 to green 3 in some areas), and preserving structural elements (e.g., backgrounds like 8, 9, 7, 4). The goal is to identify patterns from training examples, such as connected components or regions, to apply transformations only where rules match, rather than globally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Not all empty spaces (0s) are filled with orange (5); in train example 1 expected output, many 0s remain unfilled (e.g., positions like row 1 col 7 is 0, row 3 col 5 is 0), suggesting filling is selective, possibly only in certain connected regions, bounded areas, or non-structural empties, while others (e.g., in outlines or specific shapes) stay 0 to maintain transparency or separation.
 * Blue (1) changes to green (3) are not universal; in train example 1 expected, some 1s remain 1 (e.g., row 1-2 col 15-16 are 1s), while others become 3 (e.g., row 14-15 col 4-5 are 3s, possibly from original 1s or other colors); this implies changes based on connectivity, enclosure, or adjacency to other elements like 2s or 5s, not blanket replacement.
 * Structural backgrounds (e.g., 8 in train 1, 9/4/7 in train 2, 7 in train 3) are preserved unchanged, but some non-background elements like 7s in train 2 are transformed to 3s or 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9 expected 3s vs. generated 7s), indicating rules distinguish between fixed structures and mutable components, possibly via flood-fill or component detection.
 * In train example 3 expected, some areas get 5s (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 expected 3,3 but with 5s in row 2 col 10-13), and 1s appear in places like row 7 col 10-11, suggesting introductions of new colors (1 or 5) in enclosed or adjacent regions, and selective filling of 0s only in specific blobs (e.g., row 2 col 2-3 has 5s where generated has 3s incorrectly).
 * Subtle element: Transformations may involve "components" (connected groups of same-number cells, 4- or 8-connected), as hinted in the attempt's docstring; e.g., in train 1, blue components near certain shapes change, but isolated ones don't—need to detect and classify components by size, shape, or enclosure.
 * Across examples, 2s (possibly red or objects) remain unchanged, 5s (orange) are added selectively, and greens (3) replace blues (1) or other colors (like 7s in train 2) only in "interior" or bounded areas; empties in "exteriors" or outlines stay 0.
 * Potential oversight: Rules might prioritize "filling holes" in objects (e.g., enclosed 0s become 5), changing colors based on surrounding structures (e.g., 1 inside a 2-shape becomes 3), and no global changes—requires spatial analysis like bounding boxes or adjacency checks.
 * All training outputs are incorrect, showing over-application: generated fills EVERY 0 to 5 (but expected keeps many 0s) and changes EVERY 1 to 3 (but expected keeps some 1s and changes others conditionally).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No truly helpful functions were provided in this attempt; the existing ones are overly simplistic and broken for the puzzle:
```python
# This function is broken: It fills ALL 0s indiscriminately, but puzzle requires selective filling (e.g., only enclosed or specific regions). Not helpful—avoid in future.

    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 0:
                new_g[i][j] = 5
    return new_g
```
```python
# This function is broken: Changes ALL 1s to 3s, but some 1s must remain (e.g., train 1 top-right). Not helpful without component detection—avoid or modify to target specific connected 1-groups.
def change_blue_components_to_green(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    size = len(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if new_g[i][j] == 1:
                new_g[i][j] = 3
    return new_g
```
```python
# This is a no-op (identity function), which is correct for preserving structures but unhelpful alone—puzzle needs it combined with conditional logic.
def keep_structural_elements_unchanged(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
Future attempts should include tools like:
```python
# Suggested: Detect connected components (e.g., using flood-fill) to classify regions for selective changes.
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], start_i: int, start_j: int, target_val: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Basic flood-fill to get positions of connected cells with target_val; return set of (i,j) for analysis (e.g., size, enclosure).
    # Implementation omitted for brevity, but essential for identifying "components" mentioned in attempt docstrings.
    pass
```
```python
# Suggested: Check if a region is "enclosed" (e.g., surrounded by non-0/non-target walls) to decide filling or color change.
def is_enclosed(g: List[List[int]], component_positions: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    # Analyze bounding box or adjacency to background (e.g., 8/9/7/4); true if no path to edge.

 * This attempt (the only one provided) blindly fills all 0s with 5 and all 1s with 3, ignoring selectivity—resulting in train 1 generated having extra 5s where expected has 0s (e.g., row 1 col 7: generated 5 vs. expected 0; row 3 col 5: 5 vs. 0) and extra 3s where expected has 1s (e.g., row 1 col 15-16: 3 vs. 1), and missing new 3s in bottom (e.g., row 14 col 4-5: generated 2? wait, actually 3 from change, but positions mismatch overall).
 * Train 2 mismatches heavily: generated keeps 7s and 4s unchanged where expected changes to 3s and 5s (e.g., row 0 col 7-9: generated 7,7 vs. expected 3,3; row 0 col 6 and 9: 4 vs. 5), and no 0-filling needed here but over-applies if any 0s present—suggests 7s or other colors change conditionally to 3/5, not just 1s.
 * Train 3 mismatches: generated changes 1s? but expected introduces 5s in places like row 2 col 2-3 (generated 3 vs. expected 5? wait, row 2: generated 3,3,7,...5,5,... but expected 3,3,7,...5,5,... wait, partial match but row 3 col 2: generated 6 vs. expected 5; and adds 1s in row 7-8 col 10-11 expected but generated likely 3 if 1s present, or unchanged—unknown input but shows over-changing.
 * Missed core: No component extraction or enclosure checks, leading to global ops instead of rule-based (e.g., fill enclosed 0s, change interior 1s).
 * The "keep_structural_elements_unchanged" is correct in intent but trivial/unhelpful without integration.
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, which is essential for subtleties like connected blues or holes—future needs flood-fill or similar.
 * Overall, demonstrates partial understanding (e.g., orange for empties, green for blues, preserve structures) but fails execution due to lack of conditions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to apply the same global rules (fill 0s to 5, 1s to 3), resulting in widespread 5s (e.g., row 8 col 6-8: 5,5,5 likely from 0s) and 3s preserved/changed (e.g., many 3s in rows 2-4 and 12-15, possibly original or from 1s), but given training failures, this likely over-fills empties (e.g., scattered 5s in row 8-9 may be where expected keeps 0s or other values) and incorrectly changes components (e.g., bottom rows have 5s in row 20-21 col 21-23, which might be selective in expected but global here).
 * It mismatches puzzle subtleties: e.g., dense 4-background preserved (good), but 3-clusters in top/mid (rows 2-4 col 5-12 and 20-23) seem unchanged, yet if input had 1s there, changing all would be wrong per train 1; scattered 5s (e.g., row 8 col 20-21: 3,3 but nearby 5s) suggest unfilled areas should remain 0 or get different treatment.
 * Does not make sense as final output—looks like a naive transformation without spatial rules, e.g., no evident selective filling for enclosed regions (test grid has complex shapes like 9-blobs and 3-lines, likely needing component-based changes); expected probably keeps some 0s (not shown, but inferred from trains) and conditional 1-to-3 or other swaps (e.g., some 9s or 4s to 5/3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or modification, likely a type of logic puzzle (e.g., similar to nonogram, fillomino, or region-based filling) where input grids with partial numbers (0-9 representing colors, sizes, or fills) need to be updated by setting specific cells to correct values based on patterns, symmetries, or rules like matching adjacent regions or completing shapes. The goal is to produce an exact output grid that matches hidden rules, but the current approach uses size-specific hardcoding of cell changes, which partially mimics patterns but fails to generalize or apply the correct values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 15x15, 18x18, 20x20, 30x30), and rules may depend on size, but hardcoding per size misses underlying logic like symmetry, region grouping, or number propagation (e.g., filling regions with consistent numbers like 3s for size-3 areas).
 * Numbers represent distinct elements: e.g., 0 might be empty/blank, 1-9 could be fills for shapes/objects (possibly region sizes in fillomino-style puzzles where equal numbers form connected regions of that size), and backgrounds are consistent (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test).
 * Subtle elements: Changes often cluster in specific areas (e.g., corners, centers, or borders), suggesting rules for completing incomplete shapes (e.g., extending lines or filling blobs); mismatches occur when wrong numbers are used (e.g., 7 instead of 5), indicating values must derive from puzzle logic like counting adjacent cells or matching patterns, not arbitrary assignment.
 * Symmetry is common (e.g., mirrored patterns in trainings), but not always perfect; avoid over-applying changes that break existing structures.
 * Background numbers differ per puzzle (e.g., 8=background in train1, but 7/9 are fills); overwriting incorrectly can corrupt inputs.
 * For larger grids like 30x30, sparse changes (e.g., only 18 cells) suggest focused completions, but rules might require detecting multiple objects/regions.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have new numbers (e.g., 3,5) not in the hardcoded 7/9, implying dynamic value calculation (e.g., based on region size); also, some positions remain unchanged if already correct.
 * All attempts assume input grids are partial and need targeted fills, but no validation of connectivity or rule satisfaction (e.g., no region size checks).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No truly helpful general functions in the attempt; the program relies on hardcoded lists, which are brittle and size-specific. The deepcopy is useful for preserving inputs but not puzzle-solving.

```python
from copy import deepcopy  # Useful for non-destructive modification of input grid
```

```python
# No extraction functions provided; a potential helpful one (not in attempt) could be for identifying regions:
def find_regions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Placeholder: DFS/BFS to group connected same-number cells, returning list of region coords and size
    # This would help detect what needs filling (e.g., incomplete regions of size X get filled with X)
    pass  # Not implemented; attempt lacks anything like this, making it unhelpful for generalization
```

The hardcoded changes list is somewhat helpful for pattern observation (e.g., clustering in rows 8-10 for n=30) but broken for correctness—it's not rule-based and fails all tests; avoid reusing without logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) is hardcoded per grid size, correctly identifying some change locations (e.g., in train1, it sets bottom-right clusters near expected 3/5 areas, and row 13-15 cols 10-11 to 9 where expected has 3s) but uses wrong values (e.g., 7s instead of 5s in train1 rows 3/11/12 col16 and equivalents; 9s instead of 3s in train1 rows 13-15; misses introducing 3s entirely).
 * Worked: Partial positional accuracy (e.g., train2 changes top rows to 7/9 in areas where expected has 5/3, suggesting it detects "top banner" patterns; train3 places some 1/2/6 in mid-grid matching expected positions but wrong values like 9s instead of 3/5 in rows 1-2; for n=30, it targets two 3x3 blocks to 9, which might align with expected clusters but value wrong).
 * Didn't work: All three trainings fully incorrect due to value mismatches (e.g., train1 generated 7/9 where expected 5/3, corrupting shape colors; train2 top row generated [9s and 7s] vs expected [9s with 5/3/5]; train3 rows 1-2 generated 9s vs expected 3s/5s, and misses extending 5s leftward in row8-9; no changes for unlisted sizes, but test is 30x30 with partial changes only). Fails to propagate numbers correctly (e.g., doesn't fill entire regions consistently).
 * Missed dynamic value assignment (e.g., why 5/3 in expected? Possibly region sizes—e.g., count connected 0s or blanks to assign); over-relies on 7/9 without basis.
 * Train1: Mismatches in bottom (e.g., row12 col3: gen8 exp nothing changed? but overall 7 vs5 in col16; row13 col10-11: gen9 exp3; unknown why 9 chosen over 3—perhaps mispatterned from other grids).
 * Train2: Top mismatches (row0: gen7/9/9/7 vs exp5/3/3/5; row1 partial 9/7/9 vs3/5/3/3/5); middle unchanged correctly but top "header" wrong.
 * Train3: Upper mismatches (row1-2: gen9/9 vs3/3 and5/5; misses left extension of5s in row8-9: gen7/5? wait gen has7s background but fills wrong); lower matches better (e.g., 2s in rows17-18 correct pos but context wrong).
 * No extraction functions; attempting to add region-finding (as placeholder) is essential for future, as hardcoding ignores object detection.
 * deepcopy is helpful but trivial; no broken functions beyond the changes list being non-generalizable.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for presumed 30x30 input) does not look correct; it shows extensive patterns of 1s, 9s, and 4s forming what appear to be symmetric shapes/clusters (e.g., 9s in cols2-4 rows2-4 and symmetric on right; 1s forming borders or frames around centers in rows5-25), but this seems over-modified beyond the program's sparse changes (only 18 cells to9 in two 3x3 blocks at rows8-10 cols6-8 and rows18-20 cols21-23), suggesting the input already had 1s/9s and the output is mostly input + minor9s, but patterns don't form coherent objects (e.g., 1s clusters look like incomplete frames without consistent region sizes; 9s blocks are isolated and may not match expected fills like 2/3/5 from trainings). It lacks the focused, rule-based completion seen in expected trainings (e.g., no evidence of region-size filling), and since trainings failed similarly (wrong values in clusters), this likely has incorrect values (e.g., 1s/9s where expected might need 2/6 or similar for size-matching). Doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle—shapes are asymmetric in fills and miss background purity (4s interrupted oddly); to handle test, need general region detection to assign correct numbers dynamically, not just add9s.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by numbers (colors), where the task appears to be transforming the grid by detecting the background color, identifying and selectively recoloring empty spaces (0s) that are enclosed or part of specific regions (likely via flood fill or connected components), and possibly recoloring certain existing shapes or objects based on structural rules like enclosure, connectivity, or topology (e.g., filling holes with one color like 5 and altering object colors like 2 to 3).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color (e.g., 8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3, 4 in test), and transformations should not alter it unless it's part of a rule.
 * Not all 0s are filled; only enclosed or bounded 0 regions seem to be targeted with a new color (e.g., 5), while open or boundary-touching 0s remain 0— the provided fill_enclosed_zeros function blindly fills all 0s, ignoring enclosure, which causes overfilling.
 * Existing non-zero colors are sometimes recolored based on context (e.g., in train1, bottom-left 2s become 3s in expected, suggesting a rule for certain object types like filled shapes or blobs; in train3, 1s and 6s get surrounded or altered to introduce 3s and 5s in specific patterns).
 * Connected components matter: shapes like blobs of 1s, 2s, or 6s may need extraction to determine if they enclose areas (e.g., train1 has 1s and 2s forming potential enclosures; train3 shows 1s and 6s with 5s filling inner areas and 3s for outer blobs).
 * Subtle topology: "Enclosed" likely means fully surrounded by non-background/non-zero cells, not touching the grid edge—missing this leads to filling edge-adjacent 0s incorrectly.
 * Color choices: New colors like 5 (orange?) for fills and 3 for certain objects are consistent across examples, but depend on input (e.g., 5 for holes, 3 for specific shapes).
 * Grid boundaries and padding: All examples have background borders; transformations preserve structure but alter internals—ensure no spillover.
 * Potential object rules: Blobs may be classified by size, shape, or holes (e.g., train1 bottom changes suggest a "key" or "object" recoloring if it has certain features like no holes).
 * Avoid global changes: The program ignores connectivity, so it fails on partial enclosures (e.g., train2 has scattered 3s and 5s in expected, suggesting selective blob recoloring around 4s,6s,7s).
 * Edge cases: Irregular shapes (train3's winding 1s and 6s) require robust connected component labeling; test input has complex interleaving of 1s,5s,9s, suggesting multiple enclosed regions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from collections import deque, Counter

def detect_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Detect the background color as the most frequent value in the grid."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    counts = Counter(flat)
    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is useful for identifying the outer color to avoid filling background-adjacent 0s.)

```python
def find_enclosed_regions(g: List[List[int]], background: int, fill_color: int = 5) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Flood fill to identify and fill only 0 regions not touching the background or edges."""
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    output = [row[:] for row in g]
    
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    # Mark all background-touching 0s as "open" (don't fill)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] == 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                # Check if this 0 touches edge or background
                touches_open = False
                queue = deque([(r, c)])
                component = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    if (x == 0 or x == rows-1 or y == 0 or y == cols-1) or g[x][y] == background:
                        touches_open = True
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == 0 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                            component.append((nx, ny))
                if not touches_open:
                    # Fill enclosed component
                    for x, y in component:
                        output[x][y] = fill_color
    return output
```
(This would be an improvement over the broken fill_enclosed_zeros; it uses BFS flood fill to detect enclosed 0s. Not yet implemented in the program, but essential for selectivity.)

```python
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int, background: int) -> List[Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:

        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] == color and not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != background:
                component = set()
                queue = deque([(r, c)])
                visited[r][c] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.add((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny]:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                if component:  # Only add non-empty
                    blobs.append(component)
    return blobs
```
(This is helpful for identifying and potentially recoloring specific objects like 2s to 3s or 1s/6s in train3; could classify by size or enclosure to decide recoloring.)

The original `fill_enclosed_zeros` is broken/not helpful (fills all 0s indiscriminately, ignoring enclosure/connectivity—do not use in future).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt blindly fills all 0s with 5, which works partially for obvious empty spaces but fails by overfilling open/enclosed 0s that should remain 0 (e.g., train1 generated fills all 0s like in row3 col6/9/14 but expected keeps them as 0; also doesn't recolor 2s to 3s in bottom rows 13-15).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated introduces 5s everywhere 0 was (e.g., row4 col4/9/14 filled, but expected keeps 0 there); bottom 2s unchanged to 3s (unknown rule, perhaps for non-enclosed blobs); extra 5s in positions like row7 col3 where expected has 0.
 * Train2 mismatches: Minimal changes in generated (no 5s or 3s added, e.g., row0 col6-9 remain 4,7,7,4 but expected has 5,3,3,5—suggests input had 0s or needs blob recoloring around 7s/4s); generated ignores enclosures, leaving 7s/4s intact where 3s/5s expected (e.g., row1 col3-5: 7,7,4 vs expected 3,3,5).
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated fills some 0s with 5 but incorrectly (e.g., row1 col4-9: 6s unchanged but expected has 5s there? Wait, generated shows 6s, suggesting few 0s or wrong filling; row2 col10-13: 6s vs expected 5s; doesn't introduce 3s for top blobs like row1 col2-3: 1,1 vs expected 3,3); overfills or underfills enclosures around 1s/6s.
 * detect_background is correctly implemented but unused effectively (called but ignored in program).
 * No object extraction, so misses recoloring rules for blobs (e.g., 1s to 3s in train1/3, 7s to 3s? in train2).
 * Function `fill_enclosed_zeros` is incorrect and not relevant (too simplistic; causes all mismatches by non-selective filling—don't use in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it indiscriminately fills presumed 0s with 5s (e.g., row8 col6-8: 5,5,5; row9 col6-8:5,5,5; scattered 5s in rows 10-11,19-21), but given the training failures, this likely overfills open regions (e.g., the interleaving 1s and 9s in rows 2-4 suggest complex enclosures that need selective filling, not global 5s; bottom rows 19-22 have 5s where probably enclosed holes, but unchanged 1s/9s may need recoloring to 3 or similar). Without expected, it doesn't make sense as a puzzle solution—ignores blob extraction (e.g., large 1-blobs in rows 2-3 col5-12/15-22 likely need surrounding or altering) and enclosure checks (edge 0s filled wrongly). To handle test, need flood fill for enclosures and blob classification for 1/9 changes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where cells with numeric values (0-9) represent colors, empty space (0), or background, and the task is to identify connected components (likely 8-connected, including diagonals) of specific "object" colors, evaluate their visibility or positioning relative to borders (e.g., top, left, bottom), repaint them with target colors (often 3 or 5), perform flood fills on empty (0) areas from certain seeds or borders to distinguish enclosed vs. open spaces, and handle special cases based on the background color (e.g., bg=8 triggers unique rules). The output transforms the input grid into a segmented or labeled version, preserving background and non-objects while marking "visible" or "enclosed" regions appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), not just 4-connected, as the extraction uses all 8 directions; this is crucial for identifying blob-like objects that touch diagonally.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0], and it varies across examples (8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3); rules must adapt to bg, e.g., non-bg cells !=0 are potential objects, but 0 is empty/space to fill or flood.
 * Visibility checks: "Top visible" means at least one cell in the component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; "left visible" similarly checks left in the same row. These determine if an object is "exposed" from edges, triggering repaints (e.g., greens to 3 if top-visible, oranges to 5 if top- or left-visible).
 * Special case for bg=8: Only components of color 2 that "touch bottom" (any cell with row >= n-3) get painted to 3; this seems like a "grounded" or "falling" object rule, but the threshold (n-3) may be too loose or arbitrary.
 * Flood filling: Two types—(1) flood_from_seeds starts from cells with values in {1,3,5} and spreads to adjacent 0's (8 directions) with 5, but only marks visited 0's without fully propagating from new 5's in the queue (potential bug: it sets to 5 but queue only adds direct neighbors, not chaining fully? Wait, it does chain via while loop); (2) fill_enclosed_zeros floods from all border 0's (top/bottom/left/right edges) using BFS on 0's (8 directions), marks open/connected-to-border 0's as visited, then paints remaining (enclosed) 0's to 5. This distinguishes holes/ enclosed spaces from outer space.
 * Color groups: "Greens" [1,7,9] painted to 3 if top-visible (perhaps "sky" or "falling from top" objects); "oranges" [4,6] to 5 if top- or left-visible (side-exposed). But in train2 (bg=9), 9 is treated as green but is actually bg in expected, causing overpainting. 2's handled specially only for bg=8.
 * Subtleties: Do not paint bg itself (e.g., in train2, 9 stays 9); 0's on borders are "open" and stay 0 if not enclosed, but enclosed 0's become 5. Components must ignore bg and 0 in connectivity. Bottom-touch in bg=8 uses a fixed offset (n-3), which might miss if grid size varies or "bottom" means stricter (e.g., i == n-1). Flood seeds {1,3,5} suggest painting after initial repaints to propagate "influence." Diagonal connectivity can merge objects unexpectedly. In train1, some 0's stay 0 in expected (open spaces), but generated fills them wrongly. No handling for other colors (e.g., 5 in input?).
 * Easy-to-miss: After repainting components, re-run floods on the updated grid (out), as new 3/5 can seed further fills. But in code, flood_from_seeds runs before fill_enclosed_zeros, which uses original g for flooding (bug: should use out?). Visited in floods must reset per call. For bg!=8, no bottom-touch logic, but train3 suggests similar positioning rules for other colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it fails all training examples due to incorrect color grouping and overpainting (e.g., treats input 9 as "green" object in train2, but 9 is bg and should stay unchanged).
 * For train1 (bg=8): Generated correctly paints some bottom 2's to 3 (e.g., row14 col4-5, row15 col4-5 match expected), and some 5's on right (e.g., row3 col16-17), but wrongly paints extra 3's (row13 col10-11 as 3,3 but expected 3,3? Wait, row13 expected has 3,3 at col10-11? No—generated has 3,3 there but expected has them lower; actually, generated fills too many 0's to 5 (e.g., row3 col14=5 but expected=0; row6 col2=5 but expected=0; row8 col2=5 but expected=8? No, row8 col3=5 expected 0), leaving open 0's filled instead of staying 0. Bottom 2's in row8-9 col12-13 stay 2 in generated but expected painted? Unknown why—perhaps touches_bottom misses them (i=7,8 < n-3=15? n=18, n-3=15, so i=7<15 misses). Flood overfills enclosed/open distinction.
 * For train2 (bg=9): Generated paints almost entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., top row all 3's but expected mostly 9's with some 5/3), treating bg=9 as object and flooding everything; no preservation of bg or correct components (e.g., expected keeps 9's as bg, paints specific 3/4/6/7 areas differently). Color groups wrong—9 should not be in "greens."
 * For train3 (bg=7? Expected shows 7 as bg): Generated uses 3 as pseudo-bg? (all borders 3, but paints inner to 5/3), but expected uses 7 as bg and selectively paints (e.g., row1 col2-3=3,3 expected but generated row1 all 3's; row4 col2=5 expected but generated=3; bottom row17-18=2,2 expected but generated all 3's). Overpaints bg and ignores correct visibility (e.g., some 1/6 components not painted right). Component extraction likely merges wrongly due to wrong target_vals.
 * extract_components is essential and seems correct (8-connected BFS works for blobs).
 * touches_bottom is partially helpful but broken for non-strict bottom (n-3 too loose, misses mid-bottom objects in train1).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is unhelpful/broken: Overfloods 0's to 5 without respecting enclosure (e.g., fills open spaces in train1 that should stay 0); seeds {1,3,5} too broad post-repaint.
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is helpful but misused: Called on original g after floods, but should integrate better (e.g., flood on updated out); in train1, it leaves some enclosed 0's unfilled wrongly.
 * Overall: No adaptation for varying bg (hardcodes greens/oranges assuming bg!= those); program ignores input colors like 5/7 properly in non-8 cases.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It floods massive border areas to 5 (e.g., entire top/bottom/left/right rows/columns are 5's, suggesting bg=5? But input not provided—assuming bg !=5, this overpaints bg/objects). Inner structures show partial logic (e.g., horizontal 3's in rows 2-3 cols2-22 look like a top-visible "green" bar painted to 3; vertical 4's in cols13-21 rows4-25 seem like orange components painted/kept? But mixed with 1's and 9's that should perhaps be repainted). However, large 5-flooded regions (e.g., rows 0-1 all 5's, right cols22-29 all 5's) likely wrongly fill open space instead of preserving 0's or bg; enclosed areas (e.g., potential holes in the 4/1/9 structures) may not be filled to 5 correctly, as some 1/9 persist inside. 9's appear in lower middle (rows12-15 cols13-15,21-23), suggesting unreached "greens" but if bg!=9, this mismatches. Without input, hard to confirm, but it doesn't match expected patterns from trains (e.g., should have more 0's for open space, selective 3/5 only on visible components); looks like overflooding similar to train failures, missing enclosure distinction and bg preservation. To handle test, need better bg-adaptive color groups (e.g., exclude bg from objects) and stricter visibility/flood rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to transform a colored grid by identifying the background, detecting connected components (blobs or objects) of non-background colors, preserving large or key structures (including potential holes), and selectively modifying small components based on their position relative to the grid's center, while leaving holes (often color 0) intact and applying specific color changes (e.g., to green=3 or orange=5) for certain small blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is reliably the most frequent color in the flattened grid; do not change it (e.g., no observed shifts from magenta to yellow in examples).
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); use bounding boxes (bbox) and positions to determine size, location (e.g., midpoint relative to grid center at n/2, m/2), and whether they are "large" (e.g., threshold like >20 or half the max size) or small—large ones must stay unchanged, including any with holes.
 * Holes appear as color 0 within objects; they should remain 0 (not filled with 5 or other colors), as seen in expected outputs where 0's persist in interiors while surrounding colors may change.
 * Small components (size < threshold) change color based on position: top (mid_r < center_r) often to 3 (green), left/bottom to 5 (orange), but only for non-hole, non-large blobs—subtle rule may involve quadrant or relative positioning, and not all small blobs change (e.g., some stay original if right/bottom).
 * No changes to numbers or representations within objects; preserve shapes but recolor small isolated blobs.
 * Components with holes (e.g., enclosed 0's) are treated as single units—do not modify internals unless specified; large holed components are unchanged.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, test 30x30); rules must scale without hardcoding.
 * Subtle: Some small blobs in bottom-left quadrants change to 3 in train1 expected (not 5), suggesting position rules may prioritize vertical over horizontal or have exceptions for certain colors/origins.
 * All non-background colors are considered for components, but bg=8/9/7/4 in examples—exclude bg from component search.
 * Potential for multiple components of same color; track individually by bbox/position.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This is helpful and correct for all examples; use it to exclude bg from component detection.)

                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:

    return components
```
(This is helpful and mostly correct; it accurately detects components, sizes, and bbox for positioning—essential for identifying small vs. large and locations. Use DFS/stack for efficiency on large grids like test 30x30.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 9 in train2, 7 in train3) and finds connected components via 4-connectivity, which works for blob detection.
 * change_small_components_based_on_position partially understands position-based recoloring (uses center and midpoints), but misapplies: fills holes (0) with 5 incorrectly (expected keeps 0's as holes); changes some small blobs to 3/5 but wrong ones (e.g., train1 generated swaps 5's and 0's in right-side holes, adds extra 5's where expected has 0's, and puts 3's only in bottom where expected has them but misses top/left specifics).
 * keep_large_holed_component_unchanged is a good idea but broken—does nothing useful, as it just copies grid; needs to explicitly detect/ preserve holed/large components (e.g., by checking enclosed 0's or size > threshold).
 * change_background_color is unhelpful and broken—does nothing but comments suggest irrelevant magenta-to-yellow change not seen in any examples (ignore/discard it).
 * program overall structure is helpful (bg -> components -> modify small -> output), but thresholds like size >20 or >= large/2 are arbitrary and fail: train1 large blob (e.g., the '8' shape) preserved but small holes filled wrong; train2 top blobs changed to 3/7 instead of expected 5/3/4 swaps; train3 left blobs partially preserved but small 3's/5's not recolored correctly (e.g., generated keeps some 3's as-is where expected changes to 5/2/6).
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has 5's in hole positions (e.g., row3 col15=5 vs expected 0; row8 col11=0 missing); bottom blobs changed to 3's correctly in some spots but adds extra 5's; overall, too many changes to small/right components.
 * Train2 mismatches: top row1 has 3,7,7,3 vs expected 5,3,3,5 (wrong colors for small top/left blobs); row3 col13=3 vs expected 4; mid changes like row10 col4=5 vs expected 4 (fills wrong).
 * Train3 mismatches: row2 has 3's unchanged where expected changes some to 5; row4 col2=6 unchanged but expected 5; bottom row17/18 has 5's where expected 2's; misses hole preservation and position-specific changes (e.g., left small to 5, but generated keeps originals).
 * Function change_small_components_based_on_position is partially helpful for position logic but broken for holes/color rules (don't fill 0's; refine thresholds/conditions).
 * No attempt handles hole detection (e.g., count enclosed 0's in bbox); add to components dict for 'holes' to preserve large holed ones.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it arbitrarily changes small clusters of 1's, 3's, and 5's (e.g., top-mid 3's and 1's mostly preserved but some 1's in row5-8 changed to 4's? Wait, no—generated shows many original 1's/3's/5's intact but scatters 5's into positions like row8 col6-8=5,5,5 where input likely has different, and fills some apparent holes/spaces inconsistently.
 * It seems to apply position rules poorly: e.g., upper-left 3's/1's partially changed (row3-4 col2-5=3's kept, but row16-18 bottom 5's added where input has 5's already?); lower-right 1's/3's modified to 4's in scattered ways, but without clear quadrant logic—looks like over-changing small components without preserving shapes/holes (e.g., row22 col20-21=1,1 added/changed vs input).
 * Missing key: no evident hole preservation (if input has 0's, likely filled); changes don't align with train patterns (e.g., no consistent top-to-3 or left-to-5); overall, output looks like noisy recoloring rather than structured puzzle solution—probably wrong because it fails on similar position/size logic as trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs or "tiles" of the same color) must be identified and selectively recolored based on structural rules like size, position, adjacency to background, and relationships to larger elements (e.g., a "frame"). The goal is to transform an input grid into a target output by applying color changes (e.g., to 3/green or 5/orange) to specific small components while leaving others unchanged, with the background color (often 8, 9, 7, or 4) remaining dominant.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; the code uses these directions but adds diagonals in some checks, which may overcount adjacency).
 * Small tiles are defined narrowly (≤4 pixels, bounding box ≤2x2), but this may miss some targets if they are slightly larger or irregularly shaped; expected outputs show small groups (1-4 pixels) being recolored, but not all.
 * A "large frame" is hypothesized as a big enclosing component (19-86 pixels, span 10-15), but this criterion fails to consistently identify the relevant structure across examples—e.g., in Train 1, the frame seems vertical/horizontal borders, but the rule doesn't trigger correctly.
 * Overlap with frame: Only changes small tiles of the same color as the frame if overlap ≥0.5, but this doesn't match expectations (e.g., Train 1 expects some 0s and 1s to stay or change differently, not to 5).
 * Lower position: Tiles in the bottom half (center_y ≥ n/2) that are adjacent to background (including diagonals) and not frame-colored change to 3, but this over-applies (e.g., Train 1 generates extra 3s in bottom where expected has 5s or 0s) and misses upper placements.
 * Zero-filling: Small 0-components adjacent to background change to 5, but this interacts poorly with other rules (applied after, so overrides might miss cases).
 * Background is top-left cell, assumed uniform, but grids have consistent borders (e.g., 8 in Train 1, 9 in Train 2).
 * Order of rules matters: Overlap first, then lower position, then zeros— but this sequence causes cascading errors (e.g., a tile changed to 5 early skips green rule).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes diagonals in some checks, but may not for component finding; zeros (0) are treated specially but may represent "empty" small tiles needing context-specific colors; not all small tiles change—some stay original (e.g., 1s, 2s in expectations); large components (e.g., frames) must not be altered; grids are square (18x18, 15x15, 20x20), but test is 30x30—scale rules accordingly.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected changes are to 5 in upper areas (not just lower), suggesting position rule is inverted or conditional; Train 3 shows symmetric changes (e.g., 1s to nothing, but 3s expand); colors like 1,2,6 may be "noise" or fixed; no rule for propagating colors between similar components.
 * All rules assume one large frame, but examples may have multiple large structures or none; pixel counts and bbox spans are heuristics that don't fit all (e.g., Train 2's frame seems irregular).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it fails all three training examples by applying incorrect color changes based on flawed rule heuristics.
 * Train 1: Generated changes several upper small tiles (e.g., positions around row 2-3, col 7-10 from 0/8 to 5; row 3 col 14-15 from 8 to 5) where expected keeps 0s or changes to other colors; bottom greens (3s) are placed too broadly (e.g., row 9-15 col 3-4 are 3s, but expected has 1s there initially changing differently); zeros filled to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 3 col 9 stays 0 in expected but becomes 5? Wait, no—generated has 0s in places expected has 5s, like row 3 col 16); overall, too many 5s in mid-upper, missing 5s in right column (e.g., row 3-9 col 16 expected 5, generated 0/8).
 * Train 2: Generated keeps some 7s as 3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 col 7-8 to nothing, but expected 5/3; row 7 col 7-8 stay 3 but expected 7); changes bottom 3s too early (row 9-14 col 2-3 to 3, expected 7/4); misses frame overlap (e.g., left frame 4s not propagating to 5); small tiles like row 0 col 6-9 expected 5/3 but generated 4/7; unknown why adjacency rule skips some lower 7s to 3 when expected keeps them.
 * Train 3: Generated fails to change upper 1s/6s to 5/3 (e.g., row 1 col 2-3 stay 1, expected 3; row 8-9 col 1-2 stay 6/5? Expected has 5s expanding left); bottom 3s over-applied (row 10-16 col 7-8 to 3/1, but expected 1/6); frame (background 7) adjacency changes zeros/ smalls wrong (no zeros here, but small 1s/2s not recolored correctly); misses symmetric left-side changes (e.g., row 7-10 col 1 to 5 in expected, generated 6).
 * Rule_orange_from_frame_overlap is broken/not helpful: Triggers too few/often on wrong color matches, missing cases where non-same-color tiles need orange.
 * Rule_green_from_lower_position over-applies to non-adjacent tiles and skips upper ones that need green/orange.
 * Rule_fill_small_zeros helps partially (fills some 0s to 5 adjacent to bg), but interacts badly (e.g., Train 1 fills upper 0s to 5 where expected keeps 0 or changes later).
 * Rule_stabilize_large_frame is unhelpful/irrelevant: Does nothing, but large components need protection—consider expanding to avoid any large changes.
 * Find_large_frame is flawed: Pixel/span ranges don't capture irregular frames (e.g., Train 3's vertical bars not 10-15 span); may return None, skipping rules.
 * Overall, component extraction works (find_components correctly identifies blobs), but rule logic demonstrates poor understanding—changes don't align with patterns like "fill gaps in frames" or "color based on enclosure."

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It appears to copy the input almost unchanged (e.g., all 1s, 9s, 0s stay as-is, no recoloring observed in the printed grid), suggesting rules failed to trigger (e.g., no 3s or 5s added, despite small 0s/1s tiles present like row 8 col 6-8 0s adjacent to 4 bg; upper 9s/1s not changed to frame-like 5). This mismatches puzzle intent, as trainings show small tiles (e.g., 0s,1s) should recolor to 3/5 based on position/adjacency—here, lower 0s (row 19-21 col 21-23) stay 0, upper 1s stay 1. Likely, large_frame detection fails on the 30x30 scale (borders are 4, but inner structures like horizontal 9s/1s bars may not fit 19-86 pixels), and small_tile filter misses some (e.g., the 7-pixel 1s in row 2-4 col 5-11). No changes mean the program didn't apply rules effectively, making output senseless for the puzzle—expect more 5s in frame-overlaps (e.g., inner 1s bars) and 3s in lower isolated tiles.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where regions of uniform colors represent connected components (blobs) that must be recolored based on structural rules, likely modeling plant-like objects such as leaves (colored 3), stems or branches (colored 5), flowers or centers (possibly 1 or 2), and empty spaces (0), while preserving the background color (b, e.g., 8, 9, 7, 4) and avoiding recoloring irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (b) is the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test); never recolor it, and use it to define "non-background" for adjacency checks.
 * Identify 2x2 squares of the same non-b, non-0 color c; recolor them to 3 (green/leaves) only if they have horizontal adjacency to a non-b, non-c cell (subtle: check left/right for each of the 4 cells in the square, but code checks only horizontal, missing vertical/diagonal adjacencies that might be required).
 * Stem color is the first non-b, non-3 color (including 0) that is 4-way adjacent to any 3; then recolor entire connected components (4-way) of that stem color to 5 if the component is in the same row as a 3 OR 8-way adjacent to a 3 (subtle: components must satisfy both conditions in some cases, but code uses OR, leading to over-coloring; also, prioritize "first" stem by iterating used colors + 0).
 * For blue (hardcoded as 1), recolor 0-components (4-way connected) to 5 if attached 4-way to blue AND have at least one upward (north) neighbor that is blue (subtle: "upward attachment" means specifically checking above each cell in the component, not just any attachment).
 * Isolated single 0 cells (size-1 components with no 4-way adjacent non-b) get recolored to 5 (subtle: count adjacencies correctly during flood-fill, but code increments adj_non_b per neighbor, which may overcount if shared).
 * 0 represents empty/fillable space; it can act as a stem or be colored based on attachments, but not all 0s are recolored—only those meeting criteria (subtle: some 0s remain 0 if not isolated or not attached properly, e.g., in training 1 expected has many 0s unchanged).
 * Connected components are 4-way for flooding (up/down/left/right), but 8-way for some attachment checks to 3 (subtle: inconsistency in code's directions usage can miss diagonal touches).
 * Colors like 2,6 may represent petals or other elements; they aren't recolored in this attempt but appear in expectations (e.g., training 1 has 2s unchanged, training 2 has 6s, training 3 has 2s and 6s).
 * Order matters: Color 3s first, then stems to 5, then blue-attached 0s to 5, then isolated 0s to 5 (subtle: later steps may overwrite earlier ones if not careful, e.g., a 0 stem colored to 5 could conflict).
 * Grids vary in size (18x18 for training 1/3, 15x15 for 2, 30x30 for test); ensure n=len(g) handles all.
 * Subtle miss: In qualifying 2x2 for 3, adjacency check is flawed—code only checks horizontal left/right for the square's cells, but expectations suggest broader "exposed" or "leaf-like" criteria (e.g., not fully enclosed).
 * 0 can be part of larger structures but only recolored if criteria met; many 0s in expectations remain 0, indicating not all empties are stems or isolations.
 * Blue=1 interactions are specific to "upward" (vertical above), suggesting directionality like growth from base.
 * No recoloring of other colors (e.g., 2,6 stay as-is in expectations).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple

def is_valid(x: int, y: int, n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n

def get_used_colors(grid: List[List[int]], b: int) -> Set[int]:
    s: Set[int] = set()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != b:
                s.add(cell)
    return s
```

```python
directions4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
directions8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]
```
These are useful for validation, color extraction, and adjacency (4-way for components, 8-way for attachments). The color_qualifying_squares function is partially helpful for 2x2 detection but broken in adjacency logic (only horizontal checks, misses cases). Flood-fill with stack for components is good but needs better condition checks (e.g., for has_same_row and attached_to_green).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of rules.
 * Training 1: Generated over-colored many areas to 3 and 5 (e.g., bottom-right 3s and 5s where expected has 3s but keeps 0s and 2s unchanged; top-left 2x2 became 3 but expected keeps as 2; isolated 0s partially colored to 5 but some 5s appear where expected has 0s or 2s; stem logic misidentified, coloring extra 5s in rows without proper attachment).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Expected has 2s in top-left and bottom-left unchanged, many 0s preserved (e.g., vertical chains of 0s next to 2s stay 0, not 5); generated has 3s there and extra 5s (e.g., row 3 col 16-17 as 5 but expected 5 only in specific spots); unknown why stem=2 wasn't chosen correctly, leading to wrong 5 placements.
 * Training 2: Generated colored some 0s/empties to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 11-12 as 5 but expected 6; row 5 col 0 as 5 but expected 4; bottom 7s partially to 5 but expected keeps 7s); 3s correct in some 2x2 but missed propagating to adjacent 6s or 4s; blue=1 logic absent, so no upward 0 coloring; over-colored stems without row/adjacency checks.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Expected has 6s as a separate component (possibly petals) unchanged, 4s in specific chains, 7s at bottom; generated has 5s overwriting potential 6/4/7 areas (e.g., row 7 col 0 as 5 but expected 4); subtle: missed that some 3s attach to non-stem colors like 6, not coloring them to 5.
 * Training 3: Generated under-colored some areas (e.g., row 4 col 13-14 as 3 but expected 2; row 5 col 12 as 6 but expected 2; many 1s and 6s unchanged correctly but 5s over-applied in left column); stem logic colored extra 5s (e.g., row 10 col 14 as 5 but expected 6 or unchanged); isolated 0s not present, but blue=1 attachments missed upward specificity.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Expected has 2s in mid-left (rows 4-5 col 13-14) as a distinct element, 6s in chains (e.g., row 11 col 6-7 as 1 but wait, expected has 1s there? No, generated has 3s where expected 1/6; unknown why 2x2 detection failed for certain colors); 5s in top but generated spreads them incorrectly.
 * Overall: 2x2 to 3 works in some spots (e.g., training 1 top 3s) but over-applies without proper adjacency; stem selection picks wrong color (e.g., colors 0 as stem instead of 2); 0 to 5 rules partial (isolated good, but blue-upward misses directionality, and components over-colored if OR instead of AND); no handling for other colors like 2/6 as potential centers/petal unchanged.
 * Function color_qualifying_squares is partially helpful but broken (adjacency only horizontal, should be broader exposure check); get_used_colors and flood-fill stack are essential and correct for components.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but hardcoded blue=1 limits generality (if blue varies, fails); visited matrices reset per rule is good but inefficient for large grids like test.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3s in long horizontal/vertical lines (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 3-11 and 15-21 as solid 3s, but likely input has sparse colors needing only specific 2x2 qualified; this suggests 2x2 detection generalized wrongly to lines, not just squares).
 * Many 5s appear in scattered spots (e.g., row 8 col 6-7,9 as 5/0/5, but 0 remains—isolated rule partial; row 10 col 6-8 as 5s where possibly stem but over-colored without row match).
 * 1s and 9s preserved in clusters (good for unchanged elements), but 0s like row 8 col 7 remain 0 (correct if not isolated/attached), yet surrounding 5s suggest missed component merging.
 * Bottom sections (rows 18-25) have 5s in row 18-20 col 21-23, possibly from isolated 0s or stems, but chains of 1s and 9s unchanged—looks plausible for attachments but likely incorrect due to training failures (e.g., no upward blue checks visible, and 3s in row 25 col 13-15 may be wrong 2x2).
 * Overall, test output has too many 3s (line-filling instead of square-specific) and partial 5s, missing preservation of 0s/2-like elements; doesn't make sense as a "plant" structure—appears noisy, not structured like expectations' clean components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where components (connected groups of cells with the same non-background value) are identified and recolored based on visibility from the left or top edges, with special rules for certain backgrounds (e.g., bg=8 treats bottom 2's as 3's), followed by vertical downward filling and connected flooding to propagate color 5 into empty (0) areas from seeds like 1,3,5. The goal appears to be rendering or "painting" visible structures and their shadows or fills correctly, leaving internal holes or occluded areas as 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells properly; 4-connected would split some objects incorrectly.
 * Visibility from left: A component is "visible" if any of its cells has no non-background/non-zero cells to its left in the same row.
 * Visibility from top: Similar, but checked column-wise upward; however, the current check is per-cell and may overcount if not aggregated properly.
 * Recoloring rules: Odds (except 5) to 3 if left-visible or (top-visible with specific row/width conditions like min_i <=1 and width=1, or min_i=2 and width>1); evens (non-2) to 5 under similar visibility. For bg=8, override bottom-touching 2's to 3 regardless.
 * Post-recoloring: Vertical fill downward from {1,3,5} seeds into 0's (column-wise, like gravity), then flood-fill (8-directional) from {3,5} into remaining 0's, but this seems to overfill occluded/hole areas that should stay 0.
 * Subtleties: Internal 0's (holes) must remain 0 even if floodable; visibility conditions are heuristic and fail for complex shapes (e.g., the width-based top-visibility hacks suggest trying to detect "protrusions" but miss multi-row objects). Background varies (8,9,7,4), and present colors include evens/odds but exclude bg and sometimes 2/5. Bottom-touching for special cases uses a threshold like n-4, which is arbitrary and may not generalize. Flooding ignores boundaries, leading to spillover into unintended areas. No handling for diagonal occlusions or layered visibility. Ensure out-grid starts as copy to preserve originals before modifications.

(These check per-component visibility from top/left by testing if any cell in the component has a clear line of sight; useful but overly permissive as they return True if ANY cell is visible, potentially recoloring whole components incorrectly.)

```python

```
(8-directional flood from seeds into 0's; helpful for connected fills but overfills closed holes and ignores visibility/occlusion.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by over-recoloring and over-filling 0 areas that should remain empty (holes or shadows).
 * Train 1 (bg=8): Generated incorrectly recolored internal 5's (e.g., row 3 col 9=5 vs expected 0; row 4 col 9=5 vs 0) and filled vertical/horizontal 5's into what should be 0 holes (e.g., row 8 col 10=5 vs 0); special bottom 2-to-3 worked partially but flood overdid it in columns 16-17. Visibility heuristics failed to leave central voids empty.
 * Train 2 (bg=9): Generated mismatched recoloring, e.g., top row col 7-8=7 (odds) stayed 7 but expected 3; row 1 col 3-4=3 (odds to 3) but row 0 col 7-8 should be 3 not 7; evens like 4 stayed but some 6's (evens) not recolored to 5 where visible; vertical fill from 3/5 overfilled unrelated areas (e.g., row 2 col 13=5 vs expected 4).
 * Train 3 (bg=7): Generated left some odds as 3 where expected 5 (e.g., row 1 col 4-9=6? Wait, 6 even but code treats evens non-2 to 5; actually row 1 col 4-5=3 vs expected 5, suggesting wrong source sets—odds to 3 but some should be 5?); under-recolored top structures (row 1-2 col 4-9 should be 5's but partial 3's); no overfill noted but mismatches in blob shapes (e.g., row 2 col 10-13=6 vs expected 5).
 * extract_components and visibility functions are essential and mostly correct but visibility logic (e.g., width conditions) is too rigid/heuristic, missing multi-part objects or diagonal views.
 * fill_vertical_down and flood_from_seeds are helpful for propagation but broken for this puzzle as they don't respect occlusions/holes—cause main errors by filling everything reachable.
 * Special bg=8 handling for bottom 2's is relevant but threshold (n-4) is arbitrary and may not catch all "bottom" cases.
 * Overall, source sets (odds to green_src=3, evens non-2 to orange_src=5) seem partially right but fail when colors like 5/2 are present or visibility is blocked subtly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=4) does not look correct; it over-recolors large horizontal 3's in rows 2-4 cols 2-22 (likely odds visible from left/top) but leaves some internals as 3 instead of filling to 5 or leaving 0; vertical fills propagate 5's downward in cols 6-8 (from row 8 5's) and flood 5's into scattered areas (e.g., row 9 col 22-24=9? Wait, 9's stay but nearby 1's flood to 5 incorrectly, like row 5 col 21=9 vs should probably stay if occluded). It mismatches expected behavior by filling holes (e.g., around the 1's and 9's clusters in rows 5-7, where isolated 0's get 5'd) and not handling the complex L-shapes/ protrusions properly—e.g., the bottom-right 5's in row 19-21 seem underfilled compared to training patterns. Without exact expected, it appears over-aggressive like training fails, missing subtle occlusions in the dense 3/1/5/9 layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to classify and recolor connected components (blobs) of specific colors based on rules like visibility from edges (top, left, right), size, position (e.g., near bottom or top rows), and background color, then flood-filling empty spaces (0's) with 5's starting from seed colors like 1,3,5,7,9 using 8-connectivity. The goal is to produce a modified grid where certain blobs are changed to 3 (green-like) or 5 (orange-like or fill), while preserving others, and ensuring the fill propagates correctly without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is determined from g[0][0] and excludes certain colors from processing (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} - {bg}).
 * Components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals), which is crucial for blob shapes but can merge unexpectedly if not handled.
 * Visibility rules: Top-visible if any cell in component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; left-visible if no blockers left in row; right-visible similarly but checking right side (note: right-visible check in code looks for blockers to the right, but logic may invert intent).
 * Size and position filters: For green (1,7,9), skip if >4 cells; use bounding box height/width (h,w) where w > h or (h==w and top position <=2 and not right-visible) triggers change to 3. For orange (4,6), skip if >6 cells or min row >3; change to 5 if top- or left-visible.
 * Special case for bg==8: Change bottom-touching 2-components to 3, but only if they touch near bottom (i >= n-5, which is arbitrary and may miss subtle bottom definitions).
 * Flood fill starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and spreads to adjacent 0's with 5, using 8-connectivity and visited to avoid revisits, but seeds themselves are not changed (only propagate from them).
 * Empty cells (0's) remain 0 unless filled; non-seed colors like 2,4,6 may stay or change based on rules.
 * Subtle: Flood fill uses directions including diagonals, but only fills 0's; it marks visited but sets to 5 immediately, which could block further spread if not careful. Also, components of size 1-4 for green or <=6 for orange with visibility/position are targeted, but over-application can change non-target blobs.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, 30x29?), so n,m dynamic; bottom-touching defined loosely (e.g., last 5 rows).
 * Potential misses: Right-visibility may be overused or inverted; flood fill seeds include changed colors (3,5), so order matters (changes before fill). No handling for vertical/horizontal dominance beyond w>h. Components must be fully connected; isolated cells count as components.

(Flood fills 0's from seeds using BFS with 8-connectivity; works but seeds propagate immediately from neighbors, which is correct if seeds are unchanged.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated incorrectly changed left-side 2-blob cells (rows 3-7, cols 2-3) to 5 instead of leaving as 0/2, over-applied orange rules or flood; bottom 2's (rows 14-15, cols 10-11) correctly to 3, but some 5's in cols 14-16 overfilled where expected 0's; right 1's stayed 1 (correct), but flood missed some 0's turning to 5.
 * In training example 1, special bg=8 rule for bottom 2's worked partially (changed to 3), but green/orange rules over-applied to non-visible or large components, e.g., vertical structure in cols 9-10 got 5's where expected 0's.
 * In training example 2 (bg=9), generated kept some 5's and 3's correctly top-left but failed on right-side 6's (row2 col11-12 as 5 instead of 6, row3 col13 as 5? Wait, expected has 6,6,4 so under-changed); orange 4/6 blobs in rows5-6 cols1-3 stayed 4/6 (correct) but flood over-applied 5's in row1 col6? No major flood issue, but component extraction missed splitting or visibility for mid-grid 6's.
 * In training example 2, green 3's top-left correct, but size filter skipped some small components incorrectly; right-bottom 7's stayed 7 (correct, as non-green/orange), but a 5 in row1 col10 incorrect (expected 9? bg).
 * In training example 3 (bg=7), generated under-applied 5's to left 6-blob (rows1-2 cols4-5 as 3? No, as 6, but expected 5's for top parts); over-kept 6's in rows3-9 col2-3 where expected 5's in some; bottom 2's stayed 2 (correct); 1's stayed 1 (correct, perhaps non-target).
 * In training example 3, touches_bottom not triggered correctly for some, and visibility (top/left) missed for horizontal dominance; flood fill under-applied, leaving some 0's? But outputs show no 0's visible, differences in 3 vs 5 for 6-blobs.
 * extract_components is helpful and seems correct (8-connectivity matches blob shapes in diffs).
 * has_top_visible, has_left_visible, has_right_visible are essential but right_visible logic checks for no blockers to right (meaning visible from right edge?), which may be inverted—generated often fails when right-visible should block change.
 * flood_fill_from_seeds works for propagation but starts only from seeds' neighbors, not overwriting seeds; in trains, it overfills some 0's to 5 where expected 0 (e.g., train1 left structure).
 * Special bg==8 rule partially worked (bottom 2 to 3) but applied too broadly; general green/orange rules too aggressive on size/position (e.g., min_i <=3 too loose, len>4 skip misses small visible).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but touches_bottom with fixed -5 is heuristic and not general (breaks for varying grid heights).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (30x29? grid, bg=4) has many 5's already placed (e.g., row8 cols6-8 as 5,5,5; row19-21 cols21-23 as 5's), suggesting pre-flood changes, but looks over-filled—e.g., scattered 5's in row8 col6-8 may be from orange rule on 5? Input has 5's? Wait, the "generated output" includes original colors like 9's,1's,4's unchanged in places, with some 5's added (e.g., row8), but no visible 0's left, implying flood filled everything adjacent to seeds.
 * Test output does not look fully correct: It preserves large 1-blobs (e.g., rows3-4 cols5-12 as 1's, expected perhaps change to 3 if small/visible green), but adds 5's in isolated spots like row8 cols6-8 (possibly erroneous flood from nearby 5? Input has 5 there? No, input not given, but output has them as 5 while surrounding 1's/4's); bottom rows have 5's in row19-21 cols21-23, which may be correct fill but over-spreads to row22 col21 as 1? Wait, row22 has 1's.
 * Test output misses potential 3-changes for top 9/1 blobs (rows2-3 cols2-5,14-21 as 9/1, visible from top/left but stayed, violating green rule if size<=4); flood seems to have filled some but left paths open incorrectly (e.g., row12 col24-26 as 9's, possibly unfilled 0's? But output shows no 0's, all filled or colored).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (fills from seeds like 1,5,9 to 5 in empties), but incorrect due to unchanged green-like blobs (1,9) that should be 3 if visible/small, and possible over-change of 4's to 5 without position check; looks like rules applied but visibility/size thresholds wrong, leading to under-classification.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs/objects) of specific colors in a background grid, evaluate their visibility from edges (top, left, right, bottom), and transform them to new colors (e.g., 3 or 5) based on shape ratios (width vs height), visibility conditions, and background-specific rules, before performing a flood fill from certain seed values (odd numbers like 1,3,5,7,9) to fill empty (0) spaces with 5, likely simulating some kind of object occlusion or rendering in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals) groups of the same non-background, non-zero value; empty spaces are 0.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0]; exclude bg from consideration for changes, and visibility checks ignore bg and 0.
 * For "green" colors (1,7,9 if not bg): Change to 3 if top-visible and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)).
 * For "orange" colors (4,6 if not bg): Change to 5 if (top or left visible) and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)); subtle: this seems to target horizontal-ish bars or protrusions.
 * Special case if bg==8: Change 2-components to 3 if bottom-visible (perhaps shadows or ground-level objects).
 * Flood fill: Starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9}, spreads to adjacent 0s (8 directions) filling with 5, but only if not visited; subtle: this might simulate filling hidden/empty areas behind visible objects, but it can overfill if seeds are misplaced.
 * Visibility: A component is "top-visible" if any cell has no non-bg/non-0 above it in the same column; similar for left (same row left), right (same row right), bottom (below).
 * Subtleties: Changes use a dict to avoid overwriting; components must be non-empty; shape ratio uses bounding box (min/max i/j +1 for h/w); easy to miss: visibility is per-cell then any in component, and changes only if do_change condition met; flood fill uses BFS but seeds include post-change values, so order matters (changes before fill); bg can be colors like 4,8,9 affecting which are "greens/oranges"; no diagonal-only connections—full 8-way; potential over-changing if multiple rules overlap; empty grid areas stay bg unless filled.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle variable grid sizes; ensure copy_grid preserves original; visited prevents re-flood; but flood seeds include 5 which might self-propagate if adjacent to 0; rules seem asymmetric (favor horizontal changes, right/bottom less prioritized); test inputs may have no 0s initially, so fill only creates if changes introduce them? No—changes replace to 3/5, fill only targets existing 0s; subtle miss: expected outputs have 0s where generated has 5/3, suggesting changes should introduce 0s or not fill certain areas.

Note: get_size is basic/redundant; changes dict in main program is helpful for batched updates.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) passed Training example 3 (correct output matched), showing core component extraction, visibility, and flood fill work in some cases.
 * Failed Training 1: Generated filled areas with 5 and changed to 3 where expected has 0s and 2/5; specifically, upper blob (likely 2?) changed incorrectly to 3/5 instead of keeping/changing to 2 with 0s for hidden parts; flood fill over-applied 5 to what should be 0s; bottom 3s correct, but side 1s unchanged correctly; unknown why 2 not handled as special (bg=8 rule applied but wrong visibility?).
 * Failed Training 2: Generated kept some 5/3 but misplaced 4/6 vs expected (e.g., row 5 col 1-2: generated 5,5 expected 4,6; row 12 col 5: generated 4 expected 4 but surrounding mismatches); changes to 5/3 over-applied to vertical-ish components; flood fill didn't create 0s, but expected has no 0s—issue is wrong color swaps (e.g., 6s became 5?); bg=9, so greens=1,7 but input has 3,5,6,4,7—3 not changed, but oranges=4,6 changed wrong.
 * extract_components is essential and correct (used successfully in the correct example 3).
 * Visibility functions are helpful but subtle bug: they check per-cell but return if ANY visible, which is correct, but in train1, top_vis likely true but do_change wrong for vertical blobs.
 * Flood fill is mostly helpful but unhelpful in cases with no 0s (does nothing, correct) or overfills post-change seeds; in train1, it filled what should be 0s (perhaps changes didn't introduce 0s, but expected has them—suggests rule should set some to 0 instead of 3/5).
 * Changes dict avoids overlaps, helpful; greens/oranges filtering by !=bg is key but missed if bg in list (e.g., train2 bg=9 not in lists).
 * Overall: Partial rules for horizontal changes work (why example 3 passed), but vertical/square components not distinguished well; special bg=8 rule applied in train1 but wrong (changed 2 to 3, but expected kept 2 with 0s); no handling for keeping 0s or other colors like 2/5 unchanged.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have minimally changed the input (kept most 1,3,5,9 components as-is or swapped some 1/9 to 3 under rules), with no 0s introduced and flood fill doing nothing (since no 0s in input and changes don't create them), resulting in a grid full of 4(bg),1,3,5,9 without occlusions or empties.
 * Expected likely includes 0s in hidden areas (e.g., behind vertical 1s or 9s, similar to train1 where 0s represent occluded space), and possibly more changes to 5 for oranges (but bg=4, so oranges=6 only if present—input has none?); e.g., the large horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 stayed 3 (correct if not green), but vertical 9s in col 21-23 rows 5-20 probably should be partially 0 or changed if not top-visible; side 5s in row8 col6-8 stayed, but if left-visible and wide, should be 5? Wait, already 5; overall, lacks 0s where components overlap shadows, and flood fill missed because no seeds hit 0s—suggests rules need to set some component parts to 0 for depth/occlusion, not just color swap; unknown exact diffs without input grid, but output looks too "filled" vs expected sparse 0s in trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 11:28:53] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid (numbers represent colors) to identify connected components of specific "object" colors, evaluate them based on visibility from edges (top/left/right), size, shape (width vs height), and position (e.g., touching bottom), then change qualifying components to new colors like 3 (for green-like objects) or 5 (for orange-like objects), while leaving non-qualifying areas as 0 (empty) or background. Finally, perform a limited flood-fill from certain seeds (1,3,5) to propagate 5 into adjacent 0s, but only in ways that simulate "shadows" or fills without over-spreading to block visibility rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; exclude it from object colors (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} minus {bg}; similar for orange {4,6}).
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals: up/down/left/right + diagonals), extracted via BFS/DFS flood-fill on exact color matches, ignoring bg and 0.
 * For green-like (1,7,9 except bg): Only small components (size <=4); must be top-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 above it in column); shape prefers wide (w > h) or left-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 to left in row) or single-cell square at top without right visibility; change to 3 if qualified.
 * For orange-like (4,6 except bg): Slightly larger (size <=6); must have top-visible or left-visible; same shape preference as green; change to 5.
 * Special case: If bg==8, change bottom-touching (max row >= n-4? but this threshold seems arbitrary/wrong) components of 2 to 3.
 * Flood-fill: Only from seeds {1,3,5}, but propagate ONLY to adjacent 0s (8 directions), setting them to 5; however, this must be constrained to avoid filling areas that should remain 0 (e.g., "open" spaces or behind objects); current implementation over-fills indiscriminately, ignoring visibility or object blocking.
 * 0s are empty space; non-qualifying components stay as original color or become 0? But in examples, some original colors persist (e.g., 1s,2s,6s), while others are cleared to 0 or changed.
 * Subtle: Visibility checks treat bg and 0 as "transparent" (don't block), but any other color blocks; right-visible checks from right edge inward, but rarely used.
 * Shape "ok" logic is convoluted: Allows squares only if single cell and top-row or not right-visible; this may miss vertical stacks.
 * Bottom-touching for special 2: Threshold n-4 seems too loose (e.g., touches near-bottom rows); likely should be stricter (e.g., row >=n-2).
 * Flood-fill starts from seeds but immediately sets neighbors to 5 and queues them, leading to full spread; probably needs to be directional (e.g., downward/rightward only) or blocked by objects.
 * Grids vary in size; n=rows, m=cols; assume rectangular.
 * Expected outputs preserve some original colors (e.g., 1s as seeds, 2s unchanged unless special, 6s as blockers) and leave strategic 0s unfilled (e.g., holes or paths).
 * Easy to miss: Components must be fully connected; isolated pixels count as size=1; over-aggressive size limits skip valid multi-part objects; flood-fill visits 0s but shouldn't cross object boundaries or fill top/left visible areas.

These functions are helpful for component extraction (8-connected BFS), bbox/size calc, and visibility checks (treating 0/bg as transparent). They correctly identify isolated groups but need integration with stricter rules.

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
```python
def flood_fill_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Over-fills all adjacent 0s from {1,3,5} without directionality or blocking, setting to 5 indiscriminately.
    # It queues and spreads fully, but examples show selective filling (e.g., only "shadow" areas, leaving holes as 0).
    # Not helpful as-is; needs constraints like downward-only from objects or avoiding top/left visible paths.
    # Don't use without major fixes.
```
```python
def change_special_two_components(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Only triggers if bg==8, changes bottom-touching 2s to 3, but threshold n-4 is arbitrary/wrong (e.g., Train1 expected keeps some 2s).
    # Also, in Train3 (bg=7), 2s are kept as-is in expected, but logic doesn't apply. Unhelpful without generalizing or fixing threshold.
```
The change_green/orange functions are partially helpful but have wrong size/shape thresholds (e.g., skip valid >4/6? No, but misapply visibility/shape_ok, leading to wrong changes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly extracts 8-connected components and checks visibility/bg exclusion, but fails all training due to over-changing (e.g., turns non-qualifying greens/oranges to 3/5 instead of 0) and buggy flood-fill.
 * Train1 (bg=8): Generated fills too many 0s with 5 (e.g., row3 col9=5 vs exp=0; row6 col2=5 vs exp=0), changes some 1s/5s incorrectly (but 1s should be seeds?); keeps 2s but exp clears some areas to 0 without filling; special 2 logic misfires (bottom 2s changed to 3? but exp keeps 2s); shape_ok allows wrong vertical stacks as 5.
 * Train2 (bg=9): Generated changes top 7s to nothing (stay 7? but exp=3), turns some 4s to 5 correctly but misses others (e.g., row1 col10=4->? exp=5, but row2 col11-12=6 stay 6 ok); over-applies 3 to wrong 3/7 spots (e.g., row1 col3-4=3 ok, but row2 col7-8=7 vs exp=3); flood-fill absent or weak, leaving no extra 5s where exp has them (e.g., row1 col10=5).
 * Train3 (bg=7): Generated changes some 6s/1s to 3 incorrectly (e.g., row1-2 col4-5=3 ok, but row4 col2=6->? exp=5; row8 col1-2=6->? gen keeps 6 vs exp=5); misses turning vertical 6s/1s to 5 (e.g., left column 6s stay 6, but exp=5 for some); special 2 not applied (correct, but bottom 2s stay 2 ok); no flood-fill evident, as exp has 5s in empty spots but gen lacks them.
 * Overall: Visibility checks work (top/left detect edges), but shape_ok too permissive (allows non-wide as 5/3 wrongly); size limits too strict/loose; flood-fill spreads everywhere, filling "visible" 0s that should stay 0 (e.g., holes behind objects); doesn't clear non-qualifying objects to 0 (keeps originals like 5/1 where exp=0).
 * extract_components is essential and correct for grouping; get_bbox_and_size useful for h/w; visibility funcs good but has_right_visible underused/misapplied in shape_ok.
 * change_green/orange apply changes but wrong conditions (e.g., Train1 changes isolated 5s? to 5 redundantly); don't handle 1 as seed (keep as-is?).
 * Missed: Selective 0-to-5 only in "shadows" (e.g., below/right of objects, not above/left); components of same color but disconnected treated separately (ok, but aggregate? No).
 * Unknown: Why Train1 exp has 0s in a "stem" under 2s (not filled), but gen fills to 5; possibly flood only from changed 3/5, not original 1/5.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows scattered 5s (e.g., row8-10 has 5s in middle, likely from orange change) and some flood-fill (e.g., row5 col22-23=1? Wait, output has 1s persisting, but flood from them?); however, large areas of 0-implied (not shown, but gen has 4 bg everywhere else) suggest under-filling, while visible 1s/9s aren't cleared/changed properly (e.g., top 1s should be green? but bg=4, 1 is green, top-visible, size? If small/wide, to 3, then flood below to 5, but gen keeps 1s and adds random 5s). It over-relies on existing 5s for flood (row8 col6-8=5, probably wrong change of ? color), missing expected 0s in paths/holes (e.g., row12 col7-8=1s stay, but exp likely 0 or 5 shadow). Doesn't account for large grid (30 cols?); components like horizontal 1s (row3 col5-12) should be wide green to 3, flooding below, but gen keeps 1s. Looks like partial visibility detection but no clearing to 0, leading to messy unchanged areas.

[2025-10-03 11:28:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where regions of uniform colors represent connected components (blobs) that must be recolored based on structural rules, likely modeling plant-like objects such as leaves (colored 3), stems or branches (colored 5), flowers or centers (possibly 1 or 2), and empty spaces (0), while preserving the background color (b, e.g., 8, 9, 7, 4) and avoiding recoloring irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (b) is the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test); never recolor it, and use it to define "non-background" for adjacency checks.
 * Identify 2x2 squares of the same non-b, non-0 color c; recolor them to 3 (green/leaves) only if they have horizontal adjacency to a non-b, non-c cell (subtle: check left/right for each of the 4 cells in the square, but code checks only horizontal, missing vertical/diagonal adjacencies that might be required).
 * Stem color is the first non-b, non-3 color (including 0) that is 4-way adjacent to any 3; then recolor entire connected components (4-way) of that stem color to 5 if the component is in the same row as a 3 OR 8-way adjacent to a 3 (subtle: components must satisfy both conditions in some cases, but code uses OR, leading to over-coloring; also, prioritize "first" stem by iterating used colors + 0).
 * For blue (hardcoded as 1), recolor 0-components (4-way connected) to 5 if attached 4-way to blue AND have at least one upward (north) neighbor that is blue (subtle: "upward attachment" means specifically checking above each cell in the component, not just any attachment).
 * Isolated single 0 cells (size-1 components with no 4-way adjacent non-b) get recolored to 5 (subtle: count adjacencies correctly during flood-fill, but code increments adj_non_b per neighbor, which may overcount if shared).
 * 0 represents empty/fillable space; it can act as a stem or be colored based on attachments, but not all 0s are recolored—only those meeting criteria (subtle: some 0s remain 0 if not isolated or not attached properly, e.g., in training 1 expected has many 0s unchanged).
 * Connected components are 4-way for flooding (up/down/left/right), but 8-way for some attachment checks to 3 (subtle: inconsistency in code's directions usage can miss diagonal touches).
 * Colors like 2,6 may represent petals or other elements; they aren't recolored in this attempt but appear in expectations (e.g., training 1 has 2s unchanged, training 2 has 6s, training 3 has 2s and 6s).
 * Order matters: Color 3s first, then stems to 5, then blue-attached 0s to 5, then isolated 0s to 5 (subtle: later steps may overwrite earlier ones if not careful, e.g., a 0 stem colored to 5 could conflict).
 * Grids vary in size (18x18 for training 1/3, 15x15 for 2, 30x30 for test); ensure n=len(g) handles all.
 * Subtle miss: In qualifying 2x2 for 3, adjacency check is flawed—code only checks horizontal left/right for the square's cells, but expectations suggest broader "exposed" or "leaf-like" criteria (e.g., not fully enclosed).
 * 0 can be part of larger structures but only recolored if criteria met; many 0s in expectations remain 0, indicating not all empties are stems or isolations.
 * Blue=1 interactions are specific to "upward" (vertical above), suggesting directionality like growth from base.
 * No recoloring of other colors (e.g., 2,6 stay as-is in expectations).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple

def is_valid(x: int, y: int, n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n

def get_used_colors(grid: List[List[int]], b: int) -> Set[int]:
    s: Set[int] = set()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != b:
                s.add(cell)
    return s
```

```python
directions4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
directions8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]
```
These are useful for validation, color extraction, and adjacency (4-way for components, 8-way for attachments). The color_qualifying_squares function is partially helpful for 2x2 detection but broken in adjacency logic (only horizontal checks, misses cases). Flood-fill with stack for components is good but needs better condition checks (e.g., for has_same_row and attached_to_green).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of rules.
 * Training 1: Generated over-colored many areas to 3 and 5 (e.g., bottom-right 3s and 5s where expected has 3s but keeps 0s and 2s unchanged; top-left 2x2 became 3 but expected keeps as 2; isolated 0s partially colored to 5 but some 5s appear where expected has 0s or 2s; stem logic misidentified, coloring extra 5s in rows without proper attachment).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Expected has 2s in top-left and bottom-left unchanged, many 0s preserved (e.g., vertical chains of 0s next to 2s stay 0, not 5); generated has 3s there and extra 5s (e.g., row 3 col 16-17 as 5 but expected 5 only in specific spots); unknown why stem=2 wasn't chosen correctly, leading to wrong 5 placements.
 * Training 2: Generated colored some 0s/empties to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 11-12 as 5 but expected 6; row 5 col 0 as 5 but expected 4; bottom 7s partially to 5 but expected keeps 7s); 3s correct in some 2x2 but missed propagating to adjacent 6s or 4s; blue=1 logic absent, so no upward 0 coloring; over-colored stems without row/adjacency checks.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Expected has 6s as a separate component (possibly petals) unchanged, 4s in specific chains, 7s at bottom; generated has 5s overwriting potential 6/4/7 areas (e.g., row 7 col 0 as 5 but expected 4); subtle: missed that some 3s attach to non-stem colors like 6, not coloring them to 5.
 * Training 3: Generated under-colored some areas (e.g., row 4 col 13-14 as 3 but expected 2; row 5 col 12 as 6 but expected 2; many 1s and 6s unchanged correctly but 5s over-applied in left column); stem logic colored extra 5s (e.g., row 10 col 14 as 5 but expected 6 or unchanged); isolated 0s not present, but blue=1 attachments missed upward specificity.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Expected has 2s in mid-left (rows 4-5 col 13-14) as a distinct element, 6s in chains (e.g., row 11 col 6-7 as 1 but wait, expected has 1s there? No, generated has 3s where expected 1/6; unknown why 2x2 detection failed for certain colors); 5s in top but generated spreads them incorrectly.
 * Overall: 2x2 to 3 works in some spots (e.g., training 1 top 3s) but over-applies without proper adjacency; stem selection picks wrong color (e.g., colors 0 as stem instead of 2); 0 to 5 rules partial (isolated good, but blue-upward misses directionality, and components over-colored if OR instead of AND); no handling for other colors like 2/6 as potential centers/petal unchanged.
 * Function color_qualifying_squares is partially helpful but broken (adjacency only horizontal, should be broader exposure check); get_used_colors and flood-fill stack are essential and correct for components.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but hardcoded blue=1 limits generality (if blue varies, fails); visited matrices reset per rule is good but inefficient for large grids like test.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3s in long horizontal/vertical lines (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 3-11 and 15-21 as solid 3s, but likely input has sparse colors needing only specific 2x2 qualified; this suggests 2x2 detection generalized wrongly to lines, not just squares).
 * Many 5s appear in scattered spots (e.g., row 8 col 6-7,9 as 5/0/5, but 0 remains—isolated rule partial; row 10 col 6-8 as 5s where possibly stem but over-colored without row match).
 * 1s and 9s preserved in clusters (good for unchanged elements), but 0s like row 8 col 7 remain 0 (correct if not isolated/attached), yet surrounding 5s suggest missed component merging.
 * Bottom sections (rows 18-25) have 5s in row 18-20 col 21-23, possibly from isolated 0s or stems, but chains of 1s and 9s unchanged—looks plausible for attachments but likely incorrect due to training failures (e.g., no upward blue checks visible, and 3s in row 25 col 13-15 may be wrong 2x2).
 * Overall, test output has too many 3s (line-filling instead of square-specific) and partial 5s, missing preservation of 0s/2-like elements; doesn't make sense as a "plant" structure—appears noisy, not structured like expectations' clean components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where components (connected groups of cells with the same non-background value) are identified and recolored based on visibility from the left or top edges, with special rules for certain backgrounds (e.g., bg=8 treats bottom 2's as 3's), followed by vertical downward filling and connected flooding to propagate color 5 into empty (0) areas from seeds like 1,3,5. The goal appears to be rendering or "painting" visible structures and their shadows or fills correctly, leaving internal holes or occluded areas as 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells properly; 4-connected would split some objects incorrectly.
 * Visibility from left: A component is "visible" if any of its cells has no non-background/non-zero cells to its left in the same row.
 * Visibility from top: Similar, but checked column-wise upward; however, the current check is per-cell and may overcount if not aggregated properly.
 * Recoloring rules: Odds (except 5) to 3 if left-visible or (top-visible with specific row/width conditions like min_i <=1 and width=1, or min_i=2 and width>1); evens (non-2) to 5 under similar visibility. For bg=8, override bottom-touching 2's to 3 regardless.
 * Post-recoloring: Vertical fill downward from {1,3,5} seeds into 0's (column-wise, like gravity), then flood-fill (8-directional) from {3,5} into remaining 0's, but this seems to overfill occluded/hole areas that should stay 0.
 * Subtleties: Internal 0's (holes) must remain 0 even if floodable; visibility conditions are heuristic and fail for complex shapes (e.g., the width-based top-visibility hacks suggest trying to detect "protrusions" but miss multi-row objects). Background varies (8,9,7,4), and present colors include evens/odds but exclude bg and sometimes 2/5. Bottom-touching for special cases uses a threshold like n-4, which is arbitrary and may not generalize. Flooding ignores boundaries, leading to spillover into unintended areas. No handling for diagonal occlusions or layered visibility. Ensure out-grid starts as copy to preserve originals before modifications.

(8-directional flood from seeds into 0's; helpful for connected fills but overfills closed holes and ignores visibility/occlusion.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by over-recoloring and over-filling 0 areas that should remain empty (holes or shadows).
 * Train 1 (bg=8): Generated incorrectly recolored internal 5's (e.g., row 3 col 9=5 vs expected 0; row 4 col 9=5 vs 0) and filled vertical/horizontal 5's into what should be 0 holes (e.g., row 8 col 10=5 vs 0); special bottom 2-to-3 worked partially but flood overdid it in columns 16-17. Visibility heuristics failed to leave central voids empty.
 * Train 2 (bg=9): Generated mismatched recoloring, e.g., top row col 7-8=7 (odds) stayed 7 but expected 3; row 1 col 3-4=3 (odds to 3) but row 0 col 7-8 should be 3 not 7; evens like 4 stayed but some 6's (evens) not recolored to 5 where visible; vertical fill from 3/5 overfilled unrelated areas (e.g., row 2 col 13=5 vs expected 4).
 * Train 3 (bg=7): Generated left some odds as 3 where expected 5 (e.g., row 1 col 4-9=6? Wait, 6 even but code treats evens non-2 to 5; actually row 1 col 4-5=3 vs expected 5, suggesting wrong source sets—odds to 3 but some should be 5?); under-recolored top structures (row 1-2 col 4-9 should be 5's but partial 3's); no overfill noted but mismatches in blob shapes (e.g., row 2 col 10-13=6 vs expected 5).
 * extract_components and visibility functions are essential and mostly correct but visibility logic (e.g., width conditions) is too rigid/heuristic, missing multi-part objects or diagonal views.
 * fill_vertical_down and flood_from_seeds are helpful for propagation but broken for this puzzle as they don't respect occlusions/holes—cause main errors by filling everything reachable.
 * Special bg=8 handling for bottom 2's is relevant but threshold (n-4) is arbitrary and may not catch all "bottom" cases.
 * Overall, source sets (odds to green_src=3, evens non-2 to orange_src=5) seem partially right but fail when colors like 5/2 are present or visibility is blocked subtly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=4) does not look correct; it over-recolors large horizontal 3's in rows 2-4 cols 2-22 (likely odds visible from left/top) but leaves some internals as 3 instead of filling to 5 or leaving 0; vertical fills propagate 5's downward in cols 6-8 (from row 8 5's) and flood 5's into scattered areas (e.g., row 9 col 22-24=9? Wait, 9's stay but nearby 1's flood to 5 incorrectly, like row 5 col 21=9 vs should probably stay if occluded). It mismatches expected behavior by filling holes (e.g., around the 1's and 9's clusters in rows 5-7, where isolated 0's get 5'd) and not handling the complex L-shapes/ protrusions properly—e.g., the bottom-right 5's in row 19-21 seem underfilled compared to training patterns. Without exact expected, it appears over-aggressive like training fails, missing subtle occlusions in the dense 3/1/5/9 layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to classify and recolor connected components (blobs) of specific colors based on rules like visibility from edges (top, left, right), size, position (e.g., near bottom or top rows), and background color, then flood-filling empty spaces (0's) with 5's starting from seed colors like 1,3,5,7,9 using 8-connectivity. The goal is to produce a modified grid where certain blobs are changed to 3 (green-like) or 5 (orange-like or fill), while preserving others, and ensuring the fill propagates correctly without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is determined from g[0][0] and excludes certain colors from processing (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} - {bg}).
 * Components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals), which is crucial for blob shapes but can merge unexpectedly if not handled.
 * Visibility rules: Top-visible if any cell in component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; left-visible if no blockers left in row; right-visible similarly but checking right side (note: right-visible check in code looks for blockers to the right, but logic may invert intent).
 * Size and position filters: For green (1,7,9), skip if >4 cells; use bounding box height/width (h,w) where w > h or (h==w and top position <=2 and not right-visible) triggers change to 3. For orange (4,6), skip if >6 cells or min row >3; change to 5 if top- or left-visible.
 * Special case for bg==8: Change bottom-touching 2-components to 3, but only if they touch near bottom (i >= n-5, which is arbitrary and may miss subtle bottom definitions).
 * Flood fill starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and spreads to adjacent 0's with 5, using 8-connectivity and visited to avoid revisits, but seeds themselves are not changed (only propagate from them).
 * Empty cells (0's) remain 0 unless filled; non-seed colors like 2,4,6 may stay or change based on rules.
 * Subtle: Flood fill uses directions including diagonals, but only fills 0's; it marks visited but sets to 5 immediately, which could block further spread if not careful. Also, components of size 1-4 for green or <=6 for orange with visibility/position are targeted, but over-application can change non-target blobs.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, 30x29?), so n,m dynamic; bottom-touching defined loosely (e.g., last 5 rows).
 * Potential misses: Right-visibility may be overused or inverted; flood fill seeds include changed colors (3,5), so order matters (changes before fill). No handling for vertical/horizontal dominance beyond w>h. Components must be fully connected; isolated cells count as components.

(Flood fills 0's from seeds using BFS with 8-connectivity; works but seeds propagate immediately from neighbors, which is correct if seeds are unchanged.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated incorrectly changed left-side 2-blob cells (rows 3-7, cols 2-3) to 5 instead of leaving as 0/2, over-applied orange rules or flood; bottom 2's (rows 14-15, cols 10-11) correctly to 3, but some 5's in cols 14-16 overfilled where expected 0's; right 1's stayed 1 (correct), but flood missed some 0's turning to 5.
 * In training example 1, special bg=8 rule for bottom 2's worked partially (changed to 3), but green/orange rules over-applied to non-visible or large components, e.g., vertical structure in cols 9-10 got 5's where expected 0's.
 * In training example 2 (bg=9), generated kept some 5's and 3's correctly top-left but failed on right-side 6's (row2 col11-12 as 5 instead of 6, row3 col13 as 5? Wait, expected has 6,6,4 so under-changed); orange 4/6 blobs in rows5-6 cols1-3 stayed 4/6 (correct) but flood over-applied 5's in row1 col6? No major flood issue, but component extraction missed splitting or visibility for mid-grid 6's.
 * In training example 2, green 3's top-left correct, but size filter skipped some small components incorrectly; right-bottom 7's stayed 7 (correct, as non-green/orange), but a 5 in row1 col10 incorrect (expected 9? bg).
 * In training example 3 (bg=7), generated under-applied 5's to left 6-blob (rows1-2 cols4-5 as 3? No, as 6, but expected 5's for top parts); over-kept 6's in rows3-9 col2-3 where expected 5's in some; bottom 2's stayed 2 (correct); 1's stayed 1 (correct, perhaps non-target).
 * In training example 3, touches_bottom not triggered correctly for some, and visibility (top/left) missed for horizontal dominance; flood fill under-applied, leaving some 0's? But outputs show no 0's visible, differences in 3 vs 5 for 6-blobs.
 * extract_components is helpful and seems correct (8-connectivity matches blob shapes in diffs).
 * has_top_visible, has_left_visible, has_right_visible are essential but right_visible logic checks for no blockers to right (meaning visible from right edge?), which may be inverted—generated often fails when right-visible should block change.
 * flood_fill_from_seeds works for propagation but starts only from seeds' neighbors, not overwriting seeds; in trains, it overfills some 0's to 5 where expected 0 (e.g., train1 left structure).
 * Special bg==8 rule partially worked (bottom 2 to 3) but applied too broadly; general green/orange rules too aggressive on size/position (e.g., min_i <=3 too loose, len>4 skip misses small visible).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but touches_bottom with fixed -5 is heuristic and not general (breaks for varying grid heights).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (30x29? grid, bg=4) has many 5's already placed (e.g., row8 cols6-8 as 5,5,5; row19-21 cols21-23 as 5's), suggesting pre-flood changes, but looks over-filled—e.g., scattered 5's in row8 col6-8 may be from orange rule on 5? Input has 5's? Wait, the "generated output" includes original colors like 9's,1's,4's unchanged in places, with some 5's added (e.g., row8), but no visible 0's left, implying flood filled everything adjacent to seeds.
 * Test output does not look fully correct: It preserves large 1-blobs (e.g., rows3-4 cols5-12 as 1's, expected perhaps change to 3 if small/visible green), but adds 5's in isolated spots like row8 cols6-8 (possibly erroneous flood from nearby 5? Input has 5 there? No, input not given, but output has them as 5 while surrounding 1's/4's); bottom rows have 5's in row19-21 cols21-23, which may be correct fill but over-spreads to row22 col21 as 1? Wait, row22 has 1's.
 * Test output misses potential 3-changes for top 9/1 blobs (rows2-3 cols2-5,14-21 as 9/1, visible from top/left but stayed, violating green rule if size<=4); flood seems to have filled some but left paths open incorrectly (e.g., row12 col24-26 as 9's, possibly unfilled 0's? But output shows no 0's, all filled or colored).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (fills from seeds like 1,5,9 to 5 in empties), but incorrect due to unchanged green-like blobs (1,9) that should be 3 if visible/small, and possible over-change of 4's to 5 without position check; looks like rules applied but visibility/size thresholds wrong, leading to under-classification.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid (numbers represent colors) to identify connected components of specific "object" colors, evaluate them based on visibility from edges (top/left/right), size, shape (width vs height), and position (e.g., touching bottom), then change qualifying components to new colors like 3 (for green-like objects) or 5 (for orange-like objects), while leaving non-qualifying areas as 0 (empty) or background. Finally, perform a limited flood-fill from certain seeds (1,3,5) to propagate 5 into adjacent 0s, but only in ways that simulate "shadows" or fills without over-spreading to block visibility rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; exclude it from object colors (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} minus {bg}; similar for orange {4,6}).
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals: up/down/left/right + diagonals), extracted via BFS/DFS flood-fill on exact color matches, ignoring bg and 0.
 * For green-like (1,7,9 except bg): Only small components (size <=4); must be top-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 above it in column); shape prefers wide (w > h) or left-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 to left in row) or single-cell square at top without right visibility; change to 3 if qualified.
 * For orange-like (4,6 except bg): Slightly larger (size <=6); must have top-visible or left-visible; same shape preference as green; change to 5.
 * Special case: If bg==8, change bottom-touching (max row >= n-4? but this threshold seems arbitrary/wrong) components of 2 to 3.
 * Flood-fill: Only from seeds {1,3,5}, but propagate ONLY to adjacent 0s (8 directions), setting them to 5; however, this must be constrained to avoid filling areas that should remain 0 (e.g., "open" spaces or behind objects); current implementation over-fills indiscriminately, ignoring visibility or object blocking.
 * 0s are empty space; non-qualifying components stay as original color or become 0? But in examples, some original colors persist (e.g., 1s,2s,6s), while others are cleared to 0 or changed.
 * Subtle: Visibility checks treat bg and 0 as "transparent" (don't block), but any other color blocks; right-visible checks from right edge inward, but rarely used.
 * Shape "ok" logic is convoluted: Allows squares only if single cell and top-row or not right-visible; this may miss vertical stacks.
 * Bottom-touching for special 2: Threshold n-4 seems too loose (e.g., touches near-bottom rows); likely should be stricter (e.g., row >=n-2).
 * Flood-fill starts from seeds but immediately sets neighbors to 5 and queues them, leading to full spread; probably needs to be directional (e.g., downward/rightward only) or blocked by objects.
 * Grids vary in size; n=rows, m=cols; assume rectangular.
 * Expected outputs preserve some original colors (e.g., 1s as seeds, 2s unchanged unless special, 6s as blockers) and leave strategic 0s unfilled (e.g., holes or paths).
 * Easy to miss: Components must be fully connected; isolated pixels count as size=1; over-aggressive size limits skip valid multi-part objects; flood-fill visits 0s but shouldn't cross object boundaries or fill top/left visible areas.

These functions are helpful for component extraction (8-connected BFS), bbox/size calc, and visibility checks (treating 0/bg as transparent). They correctly identify isolated groups but need integration with stricter rules.

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
```python
def flood_fill_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Over-fills all adjacent 0s from {1,3,5} without directionality or blocking, setting to 5 indiscriminately.
    # It queues and spreads fully, but examples show selective filling (e.g., only "shadow" areas, leaving holes as 0).
    # Not helpful as-is; needs constraints like downward-only from objects or avoiding top/left visible paths.
    # Don't use without major fixes.
```
```python
def change_special_two_components(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Only triggers if bg==8, changes bottom-touching 2s to 3, but threshold n-4 is arbitrary/wrong (e.g., Train1 expected keeps some 2s).
    # Also, in Train3 (bg=7), 2s are kept as-is in expected, but logic doesn't apply. Unhelpful without generalizing or fixing threshold.
```
The change_green/orange functions are partially helpful but have wrong size/shape thresholds (e.g., skip valid >4/6? No, but misapply visibility/shape_ok, leading to wrong changes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly extracts 8-connected components and checks visibility/bg exclusion, but fails all training due to over-changing (e.g., turns non-qualifying greens/oranges to 3/5 instead of 0) and buggy flood-fill.
 * Train1 (bg=8): Generated fills too many 0s with 5 (e.g., row3 col9=5 vs exp=0; row6 col2=5 vs exp=0), changes some 1s/5s incorrectly (but 1s should be seeds?); keeps 2s but exp clears some areas to 0 without filling; special 2 logic misfires (bottom 2s changed to 3? but exp keeps 2s); shape_ok allows wrong vertical stacks as 5.
 * Train2 (bg=9): Generated changes top 7s to nothing (stay 7? but exp=3), turns some 4s to 5 correctly but misses others (e.g., row1 col10=4->? exp=5, but row2 col11-12=6 stay 6 ok); over-applies 3 to wrong 3/7 spots (e.g., row1 col3-4=3 ok, but row2 col7-8=7 vs exp=3); flood-fill absent or weak, leaving no extra 5s where exp has them (e.g., row1 col10=5).
 * Train3 (bg=7): Generated changes some 6s/1s to 3 incorrectly (e.g., row1-2 col4-5=3 ok, but row4 col2=6->? exp=5; row8 col1-2=6->? gen keeps 6 vs exp=5); misses turning vertical 6s/1s to 5 (e.g., left column 6s stay 6, but exp=5 for some); special 2 not applied (correct, but bottom 2s stay 2 ok); no flood-fill evident, as exp has 5s in empty spots but gen lacks them.
 * Overall: Visibility checks work (top/left detect edges), but shape_ok too permissive (allows non-wide as 5/3 wrongly); size limits too strict/loose; flood-fill spreads everywhere, filling "visible" 0s that should stay 0 (e.g., holes behind objects); doesn't clear non-qualifying objects to 0 (keeps originals like 5/1 where exp=0).
 * extract_components is essential and correct for grouping; get_bbox_and_size useful for h/w; visibility funcs good but has_right_visible underused/misapplied in shape_ok.
 * change_green/orange apply changes but wrong conditions (e.g., Train1 changes isolated 5s? to 5 redundantly); don't handle 1 as seed (keep as-is?).
 * Missed: Selective 0-to-5 only in "shadows" (e.g., below/right of objects, not above/left); components of same color but disconnected treated separately (ok, but aggregate? No).
 * Unknown: Why Train1 exp has 0s in a "stem" under 2s (not filled), but gen fills to 5; possibly flood only from changed 3/5, not original 1/5.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows scattered 5s (e.g., row8-10 has 5s in middle, likely from orange change) and some flood-fill (e.g., row5 col22-23=1? Wait, output has 1s persisting, but flood from them?); however, large areas of 0-implied (not shown, but gen has 4 bg everywhere else) suggest under-filling, while visible 1s/9s aren't cleared/changed properly (e.g., top 1s should be green? but bg=4, 1 is green, top-visible, size? If small/wide, to 3, then flood below to 5, but gen keeps 1s and adds random 5s). It over-relies on existing 5s for flood (row8 col6-8=5, probably wrong change of ? color), missing expected 0s in paths/holes (e.g., row12 col7-8=1s stay, but exp likely 0 or 5 shadow). Doesn't account for large grid (30 cols?); components like horizontal 1s (row3 col5-12) should be wide green to 3, flooding below, but gen keeps 1s. Looks like partial visibility detection but no clearing to 0, leading to messy unchanged areas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs/objects) of specific colors in a background grid, evaluate their visibility from edges (top, left, right, bottom), and transform them to new colors (e.g., 3 or 5) based on shape ratios (width vs height), visibility conditions, and background-specific rules, before performing a flood fill from certain seed values (odd numbers like 1,3,5,7,9) to fill empty (0) spaces with 5, likely simulating some kind of object occlusion or rendering in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals) groups of the same non-background, non-zero value; empty spaces are 0.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0]; exclude bg from consideration for changes, and visibility checks ignore bg and 0.
 * For "green" colors (1,7,9 if not bg): Change to 3 if top-visible and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)).
 * For "orange" colors (4,6 if not bg): Change to 5 if (top or left visible) and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)); subtle: this seems to target horizontal-ish bars or protrusions.
 * Special case if bg==8: Change 2-components to 3 if bottom-visible (perhaps shadows or ground-level objects).
 * Flood fill: Starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9}, spreads to adjacent 0s (8 directions) filling with 5, but only if not visited; subtle: this might simulate filling hidden/empty areas behind visible objects, but it can overfill if seeds are misplaced.
 * Visibility: A component is "top-visible" if any cell has no non-bg/non-0 above it in the same column; similar for left (same row left), right (same row right), bottom (below).
 * Subtleties: Changes use a dict to avoid overwriting; components must be non-empty; shape ratio uses bounding box (min/max i/j +1 for h/w); easy to miss: visibility is per-cell then any in component, and changes only if do_change condition met; flood fill uses BFS but seeds include post-change values, so order matters (changes before fill); bg can be colors like 4,8,9 affecting which are "greens/oranges"; no diagonal-only connections—full 8-way; potential over-changing if multiple rules overlap; empty grid areas stay bg unless filled.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle variable grid sizes; ensure copy_grid preserves original; visited prevents re-flood; but flood seeds include 5 which might self-propagate if adjacent to 0; rules seem asymmetric (favor horizontal changes, right/bottom less prioritized); test inputs may have no 0s initially, so fill only creates if changes introduce them? No—changes replace to 3/5, fill only targets existing 0s; subtle miss: expected outputs have 0s where generated has 5/3, suggesting changes should introduce 0s or not fill certain areas.

Note: get_size is basic/redundant; changes dict in main program is helpful for batched updates.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) passed Training example 3 (correct output matched), showing core component extraction, visibility, and flood fill work in some cases.
 * Failed Training 1: Generated filled areas with 5 and changed to 3 where expected has 0s and 2/5; specifically, upper blob (likely 2?) changed incorrectly to 3/5 instead of keeping/changing to 2 with 0s for hidden parts; flood fill over-applied 5 to what should be 0s; bottom 3s correct, but side 1s unchanged correctly; unknown why 2 not handled as special (bg=8 rule applied but wrong visibility?).
 * Failed Training 2: Generated kept some 5/3 but misplaced 4/6 vs expected (e.g., row 5 col 1-2: generated 5,5 expected 4,6; row 12 col 5: generated 4 expected 4 but surrounding mismatches); changes to 5/3 over-applied to vertical-ish components; flood fill didn't create 0s, but expected has no 0s—issue is wrong color swaps (e.g., 6s became 5?); bg=9, so greens=1,7 but input has 3,5,6,4,7—3 not changed, but oranges=4,6 changed wrong.
 * extract_components is essential and correct (used successfully in the correct example 3).
 * Visibility functions are helpful but subtle bug: they check per-cell but return if ANY visible, which is correct, but in train1, top_vis likely true but do_change wrong for vertical blobs.
 * Flood fill is mostly helpful but unhelpful in cases with no 0s (does nothing, correct) or overfills post-change seeds; in train1, it filled what should be 0s (perhaps changes didn't introduce 0s, but expected has them—suggests rule should set some to 0 instead of 3/5).
 * Changes dict avoids overlaps, helpful; greens/oranges filtering by !=bg is key but missed if bg in list (e.g., train2 bg=9 not in lists).
 * Overall: Partial rules for horizontal changes work (why example 3 passed), but vertical/square components not distinguished well; special bg=8 rule applied in train1 but wrong (changed 2 to 3, but expected kept 2 with 0s); no handling for keeping 0s or other colors like 2/5 unchanged.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have minimally changed the input (kept most 1,3,5,9 components as-is or swapped some 1/9 to 3 under rules), with no 0s introduced and flood fill doing nothing (since no 0s in input and changes don't create them), resulting in a grid full of 4(bg),1,3,5,9 without occlusions or empties.
 * Expected likely includes 0s in hidden areas (e.g., behind vertical 1s or 9s, similar to train1 where 0s represent occluded space), and possibly more changes to 5 for oranges (but bg=4, so oranges=6 only if present—input has none?); e.g., the large horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 stayed 3 (correct if not green), but vertical 9s in col 21-23 rows 5-20 probably should be partially 0 or changed if not top-visible; side 5s in row8 col6-8 stayed, but if left-visible and wide, should be 5? Wait, already 5; overall, lacks 0s where components overlap shadows, and flood fill missed because no seeds hit 0s—suggests rules need to set some component parts to 0 for depth/occlusion, not just color swap; unknown exact diffs without input grid, but output looks too "filled" vs expected sparse 0s in trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 11:39:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 2D list of integers representing colored cells (with 0 as empty, a background color b, and various foreground colors), and the goal is to produce an output grid by recoloring connected components of foreground colors to 3 or 5 based on rules involving their color parity, position (e.g., near the top), visibility from top or left edges (unobstructed by other non-background non-empty cells), and special cases (e.g., for specific color-background pairs or bottom-touching), followed by flood-filling remaining empty (0) cells connected to "seed" colors {1,3,5} with color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must consider all 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells correctly.
 * Background b is always the top-left cell value; ignore it and 0s when collecting used colors or checking obstructions.
 * For odd foreground colors (c % 2 == 1, excluding b and special case c=1 when b=8): recolor entire component to 3 only if it's near the top (min row index <=3) AND fully top-visible (at least one cell in the component has no non-b non-0 cells above it in its column).
 * For even foreground colors (c % 2 == 0, excluding b, c=2, and special case c=6 when b=9): recolor entire component to 5 only if near the top (min row <=3) AND (top-visible OR left-visible, where left-visible means at least one cell has no non-b non-0 cells to its left in its row).
 * Special case for c=2 when b=8: recolor to 3 if the component touches near the bottom (max row >= n-3), regardless of other rules.
 * Flood-fill only affects 0s: start from all cells already colored 1,3, or 5 (seeds), and fill adjacent (8 directions) 0s with 5, propagating to connected empties—but do not overwrite existing non-0 cells, and ensure it's a proper BFS flood to handle disconnected empty regions (only those touching seeds get filled).
 * Subtlety: Visibility checks must scan strictly above/left in the column/row, stopping at any obstructing cell (non-b and >0); if any cell in component is visible, the whole component qualifies.
 * Easy to miss: Rules are applied in sequence (special first, then odds to 3, then evens to 5), but components are extracted from the original input grid, not the modified output, to avoid interference; also, used colors exclude b and 0.
 * Flood-fill must not fill isolated 0s not connected to seeds; in some cases, 0s remain if not reachable.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18 for train1, 15x15 for train2, larger for test); rules like row thresholds (<=3 or >=n-3) are relative but fixed (top=3 rows, bottom=last 3 rows?).
 * No recoloring for certain pairs (e.g., skip c=1 if b=8 for odd rule; skip c=6 if b=9 for even rule), suggesting puzzle-specific exceptions to avoid over-recoloring.
 * Output keeps background and unchanged cells as-is, only modifies qualifying components and connected 0s.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, used colors, and 8-connected components; extract_components is essential and works well for grouping.
 * Odd color rule partially works: in train3 (correct), it likely applied top-visible + near-top to color odds to 3 appropriately.
 * Even color rule has issues: in train1, it colored some evens to 5 where expected keeps 0s or originals (e.g., generated row3 col16=5 but expected 0; row4 col13=5 but expected 0), suggesting over-application or wrong visibility check.
 * Special c=2 b=8 rule works in train1: bottom 2's correctly to 3 (e.g., row14 col10-11=3 in both), but interacts badly with flood-fill, leading to extra 5's nearby.
 * In train2 (b=9), even rule skipped c=6 correctly (no recolor), but mismatches like row2 col13=5 generated vs 4 expected (possibly a 6 or 4 component miscolored; unknown why, as input not shown but output differs); also row3 col13=5 vs 4, row4 col14=5 vs 9? Wait, expected row4 col14=9? No, expected row3 col13=6? Wait, details fuzzy but clear recoloring error for evens/4/6.
 * Flood-fill is helpful but buggy: in train1, it over-fills 0s to 5 in areas not intended (e.g., row3 col14=5 vs expected 0; row5 col2=5 vs 0; row6 col2=0 expected but generated 5? Wait, generated row5 col2=5 vs expected 0), possibly because seeds include post-recolor 3/5, but queue init only fills direct adjacents initially, then propagates—yet misses some isolations or overreaches due to 8-dir.
 * touches_bottom is useful for special bottom rule but threshold n-3 may be too loose (touches last 3 rows?); works for train1 bottom.
 * Visibility functions are core but subtle bug: they return True if ANY cell in component is visible, which is correct per rules, but in train1, this may cause over-coloring if partial visibility triggers whole comp.
 * Overall, sequence of applying rules (special -> odds -> evens) is good, but exceptions like skipping c=1 b=8 and c=6 b=9 are incomplete—train2 fails suggest more specials needed (e.g., for 4?).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though flood_fill needs fix for proper seed-adjacency without overfill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (on a ~30x30 grid with b=4, colors including 1,3,5,9) applies rules but over-fills with 5's extensively, e.g., large areas of original 3's and 1's remain but many 0's (implied in input) are 5, and some 9's stay—however, it does not look fully correct because odd colors like 1 and 3 should be checked for top-visibility and near-top to become 3, but generated keeps many 1's/3's unchanged (e.g., rows 2-3 full 3's stay 3, which might be correct if not visible, but row5 col6-7=4 stay? Wait, input has 4's as b); even 5's already present stay, but 9 (odd) in bottom areas like row5 col21-23=9 stay 9, possibly not near-top so no recolor—yet flood seems to have filled some but left others (e.g., row8 col20=1 stay, but adjacent 0's? to 5).
 * Mismatches likely: if input has near-top 1's (odd) with top-visible, they should become 3 but stay 1 in generated (e.g., row5 col2-3=1 stay); 9's (odd) near bottom stay 9 correctly (not near-top), but if any top-visible 9 near top, should be 3—generated doesn't change them, suggesting rule application missed some components.
 * Flood-fill appears to have worked partially (many 5's in empty areas connected to seeds like existing 5's in row8 col6-8), but if there are isolated 0's not touching 1/3/5 post-recolor, they should remain 0—generated seems to fill too much, similar to train1 overfill issue.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (respects b=4, doesn't touch bottom specials since no 2, keeps non-qualifying components), but likely incorrect due to under-recoloring odds (e.g., visible 1's/9's not to 3) and potential flood overreach; without expected, hard to confirm, but pattern suggests rules need tuning for larger grids or more color interactions.

[2025-10-03 11:39:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where regions of uniform colors represent connected components (blobs) that must be recolored based on structural rules, likely modeling plant-like objects such as leaves (colored 3), stems or branches (colored 5), flowers or centers (possibly 1 or 2), and empty spaces (0), while preserving the background color (b, e.g., 8, 9, 7, 4) and avoiding recoloring irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (b) is the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test); never recolor it, and use it to define "non-background" for adjacency checks.
 * Identify 2x2 squares of the same non-b, non-0 color c; recolor them to 3 (green/leaves) only if they have horizontal adjacency to a non-b, non-c cell (subtle: check left/right for each of the 4 cells in the square, but code checks only horizontal, missing vertical/diagonal adjacencies that might be required).
 * Stem color is the first non-b, non-3 color (including 0) that is 4-way adjacent to any 3; then recolor entire connected components (4-way) of that stem color to 5 if the component is in the same row as a 3 OR 8-way adjacent to a 3 (subtle: components must satisfy both conditions in some cases, but code uses OR, leading to over-coloring; also, prioritize "first" stem by iterating used colors + 0).
 * For blue (hardcoded as 1), recolor 0-components (4-way connected) to 5 if attached 4-way to blue AND have at least one upward (north) neighbor that is blue (subtle: "upward attachment" means specifically checking above each cell in the component, not just any attachment).
 * Isolated single 0 cells (size-1 components with no 4-way adjacent non-b) get recolored to 5 (subtle: count adjacencies correctly during flood-fill, but code increments adj_non_b per neighbor, which may overcount if shared).
 * 0 represents empty/fillable space; it can act as a stem or be colored based on attachments, but not all 0s are recolored—only those meeting criteria (subtle: some 0s remain 0 if not isolated or not attached properly, e.g., in training 1 expected has many 0s unchanged).
 * Connected components are 4-way for flooding (up/down/left/right), but 8-way for some attachment checks to 3 (subtle: inconsistency in code's directions usage can miss diagonal touches).
 * Colors like 2,6 may represent petals or other elements; they aren't recolored in this attempt but appear in expectations (e.g., training 1 has 2s unchanged, training 2 has 6s, training 3 has 2s and 6s).
 * Order matters: Color 3s first, then stems to 5, then blue-attached 0s to 5, then isolated 0s to 5 (subtle: later steps may overwrite earlier ones if not careful, e.g., a 0 stem colored to 5 could conflict).
 * Grids vary in size (18x18 for training 1/3, 15x15 for 2, 30x30 for test); ensure n=len(g) handles all.
 * Subtle miss: In qualifying 2x2 for 3, adjacency check is flawed—code only checks horizontal left/right for the square's cells, but expectations suggest broader "exposed" or "leaf-like" criteria (e.g., not fully enclosed).
 * 0 can be part of larger structures but only recolored if criteria met; many 0s in expectations remain 0, indicating not all empties are stems or isolations.
 * Blue=1 interactions are specific to "upward" (vertical above), suggesting directionality like growth from base.
 * No recoloring of other colors (e.g., 2,6 stay as-is in expectations).

```

```python
directions4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
directions8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]
```
These are useful for validation, color extraction, and adjacency (4-way for components, 8-way for attachments). The color_qualifying_squares function is partially helpful for 2x2 detection but broken in adjacency logic (only horizontal checks, misses cases). Flood-fill with stack for components is good but needs better condition checks (e.g., for has_same_row and attached_to_green).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of rules.
 * Training 1: Generated over-colored many areas to 3 and 5 (e.g., bottom-right 3s and 5s where expected has 3s but keeps 0s and 2s unchanged; top-left 2x2 became 3 but expected keeps as 2; isolated 0s partially colored to 5 but some 5s appear where expected has 0s or 2s; stem logic misidentified, coloring extra 5s in rows without proper attachment).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Expected has 2s in top-left and bottom-left unchanged, many 0s preserved (e.g., vertical chains of 0s next to 2s stay 0, not 5); generated has 3s there and extra 5s (e.g., row 3 col 16-17 as 5 but expected 5 only in specific spots); unknown why stem=2 wasn't chosen correctly, leading to wrong 5 placements.
 * Training 2: Generated colored some 0s/empties to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 11-12 as 5 but expected 6; row 5 col 0 as 5 but expected 4; bottom 7s partially to 5 but expected keeps 7s); 3s correct in some 2x2 but missed propagating to adjacent 6s or 4s; blue=1 logic absent, so no upward 0 coloring; over-colored stems without row/adjacency checks.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Expected has 6s as a separate component (possibly petals) unchanged, 4s in specific chains, 7s at bottom; generated has 5s overwriting potential 6/4/7 areas (e.g., row 7 col 0 as 5 but expected 4); subtle: missed that some 3s attach to non-stem colors like 6, not coloring them to 5.
 * Training 3: Generated under-colored some areas (e.g., row 4 col 13-14 as 3 but expected 2; row 5 col 12 as 6 but expected 2; many 1s and 6s unchanged correctly but 5s over-applied in left column); stem logic colored extra 5s (e.g., row 10 col 14 as 5 but expected 6 or unchanged); isolated 0s not present, but blue=1 attachments missed upward specificity.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Expected has 2s in mid-left (rows 4-5 col 13-14) as a distinct element, 6s in chains (e.g., row 11 col 6-7 as 1 but wait, expected has 1s there? No, generated has 3s where expected 1/6; unknown why 2x2 detection failed for certain colors); 5s in top but generated spreads them incorrectly.
 * Overall: 2x2 to 3 works in some spots (e.g., training 1 top 3s) but over-applies without proper adjacency; stem selection picks wrong color (e.g., colors 0 as stem instead of 2); 0 to 5 rules partial (isolated good, but blue-upward misses directionality, and components over-colored if OR instead of AND); no handling for other colors like 2/6 as potential centers/petal unchanged.
 * Function color_qualifying_squares is partially helpful but broken (adjacency only horizontal, should be broader exposure check); get_used_colors and flood-fill stack are essential and correct for components.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but hardcoded blue=1 limits generality (if blue varies, fails); visited matrices reset per rule is good but inefficient for large grids like test.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3s in long horizontal/vertical lines (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 3-11 and 15-21 as solid 3s, but likely input has sparse colors needing only specific 2x2 qualified; this suggests 2x2 detection generalized wrongly to lines, not just squares).
 * Many 5s appear in scattered spots (e.g., row 8 col 6-7,9 as 5/0/5, but 0 remains—isolated rule partial; row 10 col 6-8 as 5s where possibly stem but over-colored without row match).
 * 1s and 9s preserved in clusters (good for unchanged elements), but 0s like row 8 col 7 remain 0 (correct if not isolated/attached), yet surrounding 5s suggest missed component merging.
 * Bottom sections (rows 18-25) have 5s in row 18-20 col 21-23, possibly from isolated 0s or stems, but chains of 1s and 9s unchanged—looks plausible for attachments but likely incorrect due to training failures (e.g., no upward blue checks visible, and 3s in row 25 col 13-15 may be wrong 2x2).
 * Overall, test output has too many 3s (line-filling instead of square-specific) and partial 5s, missing preservation of 0s/2-like elements; doesn't make sense as a "plant" structure—appears noisy, not structured like expectations' clean components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where components (connected groups of cells with the same non-background value) are identified and recolored based on visibility from the left or top edges, with special rules for certain backgrounds (e.g., bg=8 treats bottom 2's as 3's), followed by vertical downward filling and connected flooding to propagate color 5 into empty (0) areas from seeds like 1,3,5. The goal appears to be rendering or "painting" visible structures and their shadows or fills correctly, leaving internal holes or occluded areas as 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells properly; 4-connected would split some objects incorrectly.
 * Visibility from left: A component is "visible" if any of its cells has no non-background/non-zero cells to its left in the same row.
 * Visibility from top: Similar, but checked column-wise upward; however, the current check is per-cell and may overcount if not aggregated properly.
 * Recoloring rules: Odds (except 5) to 3 if left-visible or (top-visible with specific row/width conditions like min_i <=1 and width=1, or min_i=2 and width>1); evens (non-2) to 5 under similar visibility. For bg=8, override bottom-touching 2's to 3 regardless.
 * Post-recoloring: Vertical fill downward from {1,3,5} seeds into 0's (column-wise, like gravity), then flood-fill (8-directional) from {3,5} into remaining 0's, but this seems to overfill occluded/hole areas that should stay 0.
 * Subtleties: Internal 0's (holes) must remain 0 even if floodable; visibility conditions are heuristic and fail for complex shapes (e.g., the width-based top-visibility hacks suggest trying to detect "protrusions" but miss multi-row objects). Background varies (8,9,7,4), and present colors include evens/odds but exclude bg and sometimes 2/5. Bottom-touching for special cases uses a threshold like n-4, which is arbitrary and may not generalize. Flooding ignores boundaries, leading to spillover into unintended areas. No handling for diagonal occlusions or layered visibility. Ensure out-grid starts as copy to preserve originals before modifications.

                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This extracts 8-connected components for a specific value, essential for isolating objects.)

(Computes bounding box for component analysis, like width for visibility heuristics.)

                visible = False

                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False
```
(These check per-component visibility from top/left by testing if any cell in the component has a clear line of sight; useful but overly permissive as they return True if ANY cell is visible, potentially recoloring whole components incorrectly.)

```python
def touches_bottom(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return max((i for i, j in comp), default=-1) >= n - 4

        while i < n:
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                i += 1
                while i < n and out[i][j] == 0:
                    out[i][j] = target
                    i += 1
            i += 1
```
(Fills 0's downward from seed columns; simulates gravity but doesn't stop at obstacles, leading to overfill.)

```python
def flood_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]], seeds: set, target: int):
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])

                visited[ni][nj] = True
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(8-directional flood from seeds into 0's; helpful for connected fills but overfills closed holes and ignores visibility/occlusion.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by over-recoloring and over-filling 0 areas that should remain empty (holes or shadows).
 * Train 1 (bg=8): Generated incorrectly recolored internal 5's (e.g., row 3 col 9=5 vs expected 0; row 4 col 9=5 vs 0) and filled vertical/horizontal 5's into what should be 0 holes (e.g., row 8 col 10=5 vs 0); special bottom 2-to-3 worked partially but flood overdid it in columns 16-17. Visibility heuristics failed to leave central voids empty.
 * Train 2 (bg=9): Generated mismatched recoloring, e.g., top row col 7-8=7 (odds) stayed 7 but expected 3; row 1 col 3-4=3 (odds to 3) but row 0 col 7-8 should be 3 not 7; evens like 4 stayed but some 6's (evens) not recolored to 5 where visible; vertical fill from 3/5 overfilled unrelated areas (e.g., row 2 col 13=5 vs expected 4).
 * Train 3 (bg=7): Generated left some odds as 3 where expected 5 (e.g., row 1 col 4-9=6? Wait, 6 even but code treats evens non-2 to 5; actually row 1 col 4-5=3 vs expected 5, suggesting wrong source sets—odds to 3 but some should be 5?); under-recolored top structures (row 1-2 col 4-9 should be 5's but partial 3's); no overfill noted but mismatches in blob shapes (e.g., row 2 col 10-13=6 vs expected 5).
 * extract_components and visibility functions are essential and mostly correct but visibility logic (e.g., width conditions) is too rigid/heuristic, missing multi-part objects or diagonal views.
 * fill_vertical_down and flood_from_seeds are helpful for propagation but broken for this puzzle as they don't respect occlusions/holes—cause main errors by filling everything reachable.
 * Special bg=8 handling for bottom 2's is relevant but threshold (n-4) is arbitrary and may not catch all "bottom" cases.
 * Overall, source sets (odds to green_src=3, evens non-2 to orange_src=5) seem partially right but fail when colors like 5/2 are present or visibility is blocked subtly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=4) does not look correct; it over-recolors large horizontal 3's in rows 2-4 cols 2-22 (likely odds visible from left/top) but leaves some internals as 3 instead of filling to 5 or leaving 0; vertical fills propagate 5's downward in cols 6-8 (from row 8 5's) and flood 5's into scattered areas (e.g., row 9 col 22-24=9? Wait, 9's stay but nearby 1's flood to 5 incorrectly, like row 5 col 21=9 vs should probably stay if occluded). It mismatches expected behavior by filling holes (e.g., around the 1's and 9's clusters in rows 5-7, where isolated 0's get 5'd) and not handling the complex L-shapes/ protrusions properly—e.g., the bottom-right 5's in row 19-21 seem underfilled compared to training patterns. Without exact expected, it appears over-aggressive like training fails, missing subtle occlusions in the dense 3/1/5/9 layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to classify and recolor connected components (blobs) of specific colors based on rules like visibility from edges (top, left, right), size, position (e.g., near bottom or top rows), and background color, then flood-filling empty spaces (0's) with 5's starting from seed colors like 1,3,5,7,9 using 8-connectivity. The goal is to produce a modified grid where certain blobs are changed to 3 (green-like) or 5 (orange-like or fill), while preserving others, and ensuring the fill propagates correctly without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is determined from g[0][0] and excludes certain colors from processing (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} - {bg}).
 * Components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals), which is crucial for blob shapes but can merge unexpectedly if not handled.
 * Visibility rules: Top-visible if any cell in component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; left-visible if no blockers left in row; right-visible similarly but checking right side (note: right-visible check in code looks for blockers to the right, but logic may invert intent).
 * Size and position filters: For green (1,7,9), skip if >4 cells; use bounding box height/width (h,w) where w > h or (h==w and top position <=2 and not right-visible) triggers change to 3. For orange (4,6), skip if >6 cells or min row >3; change to 5 if top- or left-visible.
 * Special case for bg==8: Change bottom-touching 2-components to 3, but only if they touch near bottom (i >= n-5, which is arbitrary and may miss subtle bottom definitions).
 * Flood fill starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and spreads to adjacent 0's with 5, using 8-connectivity and visited to avoid revisits, but seeds themselves are not changed (only propagate from them).
 * Empty cells (0's) remain 0 unless filled; non-seed colors like 2,4,6 may stay or change based on rules.
 * Subtle: Flood fill uses directions including diagonals, but only fills 0's; it marks visited but sets to 5 immediately, which could block further spread if not careful. Also, components of size 1-4 for green or <=6 for orange with visibility/position are targeted, but over-application can change non-target blobs.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, 30x29?), so n,m dynamic; bottom-touching defined loosely (e.g., last 5 rows).
 * Potential misses: Right-visibility may be overused or inverted; flood fill seeds include changed colors (3,5), so order matters (changes before fill). No handling for vertical/horizontal dominance beyond w>h. Components must be fully connected; isolated cells count as components.

(Flood fills 0's from seeds using BFS with 8-connectivity; works but seeds propagate immediately from neighbors, which is correct if seeds are unchanged.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated incorrectly changed left-side 2-blob cells (rows 3-7, cols 2-3) to 5 instead of leaving as 0/2, over-applied orange rules or flood; bottom 2's (rows 14-15, cols 10-11) correctly to 3, but some 5's in cols 14-16 overfilled where expected 0's; right 1's stayed 1 (correct), but flood missed some 0's turning to 5.
 * In training example 1, special bg=8 rule for bottom 2's worked partially (changed to 3), but green/orange rules over-applied to non-visible or large components, e.g., vertical structure in cols 9-10 got 5's where expected 0's.
 * In training example 2 (bg=9), generated kept some 5's and 3's correctly top-left but failed on right-side 6's (row2 col11-12 as 5 instead of 6, row3 col13 as 5? Wait, expected has 6,6,4 so under-changed); orange 4/6 blobs in rows5-6 cols1-3 stayed 4/6 (correct) but flood over-applied 5's in row1 col6? No major flood issue, but component extraction missed splitting or visibility for mid-grid 6's.
 * In training example 2, green 3's top-left correct, but size filter skipped some small components incorrectly; right-bottom 7's stayed 7 (correct, as non-green/orange), but a 5 in row1 col10 incorrect (expected 9? bg).
 * In training example 3 (bg=7), generated under-applied 5's to left 6-blob (rows1-2 cols4-5 as 3? No, as 6, but expected 5's for top parts); over-kept 6's in rows3-9 col2-3 where expected 5's in some; bottom 2's stayed 2 (correct); 1's stayed 1 (correct, perhaps non-target).
 * In training example 3, touches_bottom not triggered correctly for some, and visibility (top/left) missed for horizontal dominance; flood fill under-applied, leaving some 0's? But outputs show no 0's visible, differences in 3 vs 5 for 6-blobs.
 * extract_components is helpful and seems correct (8-connectivity matches blob shapes in diffs).
 * has_top_visible, has_left_visible, has_right_visible are essential but right_visible logic checks for no blockers to right (meaning visible from right edge?), which may be inverted—generated often fails when right-visible should block change.
 * flood_fill_from_seeds works for propagation but starts only from seeds' neighbors, not overwriting seeds; in trains, it overfills some 0's to 5 where expected 0 (e.g., train1 left structure).
 * Special bg==8 rule partially worked (bottom 2 to 3) but applied too broadly; general green/orange rules too aggressive on size/position (e.g., min_i <=3 too loose, len>4 skip misses small visible).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but touches_bottom with fixed -5 is heuristic and not general (breaks for varying grid heights).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (30x29? grid, bg=4) has many 5's already placed (e.g., row8 cols6-8 as 5,5,5; row19-21 cols21-23 as 5's), suggesting pre-flood changes, but looks over-filled—e.g., scattered 5's in row8 col6-8 may be from orange rule on 5? Input has 5's? Wait, the "generated output" includes original colors like 9's,1's,4's unchanged in places, with some 5's added (e.g., row8), but no visible 0's left, implying flood filled everything adjacent to seeds.
 * Test output does not look fully correct: It preserves large 1-blobs (e.g., rows3-4 cols5-12 as 1's, expected perhaps change to 3 if small/visible green), but adds 5's in isolated spots like row8 cols6-8 (possibly erroneous flood from nearby 5? Input has 5 there? No, input not given, but output has them as 5 while surrounding 1's/4's); bottom rows have 5's in row19-21 cols21-23, which may be correct fill but over-spreads to row22 col21 as 1? Wait, row22 has 1's.
 * Test output misses potential 3-changes for top 9/1 blobs (rows2-3 cols2-5,14-21 as 9/1, visible from top/left but stayed, violating green rule if size<=4); flood seems to have filled some but left paths open incorrectly (e.g., row12 col24-26 as 9's, possibly unfilled 0's? But output shows no 0's, all filled or colored).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (fills from seeds like 1,5,9 to 5 in empties), but incorrect due to unchanged green-like blobs (1,9) that should be 3 if visible/small, and possible over-change of 4's to 5 without position check; looks like rules applied but visibility/size thresholds wrong, leading to under-classification.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid (numbers represent colors) to identify connected components of specific "object" colors, evaluate them based on visibility from edges (top/left/right), size, shape (width vs height), and position (e.g., touching bottom), then change qualifying components to new colors like 3 (for green-like objects) or 5 (for orange-like objects), while leaving non-qualifying areas as 0 (empty) or background. Finally, perform a limited flood-fill from certain seeds (1,3,5) to propagate 5 into adjacent 0s, but only in ways that simulate "shadows" or fills without over-spreading to block visibility rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; exclude it from object colors (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} minus {bg}; similar for orange {4,6}).
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals: up/down/left/right + diagonals), extracted via BFS/DFS flood-fill on exact color matches, ignoring bg and 0.
 * For green-like (1,7,9 except bg): Only small components (size <=4); must be top-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 above it in column); shape prefers wide (w > h) or left-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 to left in row) or single-cell square at top without right visibility; change to 3 if qualified.
 * For orange-like (4,6 except bg): Slightly larger (size <=6); must have top-visible or left-visible; same shape preference as green; change to 5.
 * Special case: If bg==8, change bottom-touching (max row >= n-4? but this threshold seems arbitrary/wrong) components of 2 to 3.
 * Flood-fill: Only from seeds {1,3,5}, but propagate ONLY to adjacent 0s (8 directions), setting them to 5; however, this must be constrained to avoid filling areas that should remain 0 (e.g., "open" spaces or behind objects); current implementation over-fills indiscriminately, ignoring visibility or object blocking.
 * 0s are empty space; non-qualifying components stay as original color or become 0? But in examples, some original colors persist (e.g., 1s,2s,6s), while others are cleared to 0 or changed.
 * Subtle: Visibility checks treat bg and 0 as "transparent" (don't block), but any other color blocks; right-visible checks from right edge inward, but rarely used.
 * Shape "ok" logic is convoluted: Allows squares only if single cell and top-row or not right-visible; this may miss vertical stacks.
 * Bottom-touching for special 2: Threshold n-4 seems too loose (e.g., touches near-bottom rows); likely should be stricter (e.g., row >=n-2).
 * Flood-fill starts from seeds but immediately sets neighbors to 5 and queues them, leading to full spread; probably needs to be directional (e.g., downward/rightward only) or blocked by objects.
 * Grids vary in size; n=rows, m=cols; assume rectangular.
 * Expected outputs preserve some original colors (e.g., 1s as seeds, 2s unchanged unless special, 6s as blockers) and leave strategic 0s unfilled (e.g., holes or paths).
 * Easy to miss: Components must be fully connected; isolated pixels count as size=1; over-aggressive size limits skip valid multi-part objects; flood-fill visits 0s but shouldn't cross object boundaries or fill top/left visible areas.

These functions are helpful for component extraction (8-connected BFS), bbox/size calc, and visibility checks (treating 0/bg as transparent). They correctly identify isolated groups but need integration with stricter rules.

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
```python
def flood_fill_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Over-fills all adjacent 0s from {1,3,5} without directionality or blocking, setting to 5 indiscriminately.
    # It queues and spreads fully, but examples show selective filling (e.g., only "shadow" areas, leaving holes as 0).
    # Not helpful as-is; needs constraints like downward-only from objects or avoiding top/left visible paths.
    # Don't use without major fixes.
```
```python
def change_special_two_components(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Only triggers if bg==8, changes bottom-touching 2s to 3, but threshold n-4 is arbitrary/wrong (e.g., Train1 expected keeps some 2s).
    # Also, in Train3 (bg=7), 2s are kept as-is in expected, but logic doesn't apply. Unhelpful without generalizing or fixing threshold.
```
The change_green/orange functions are partially helpful but have wrong size/shape thresholds (e.g., skip valid >4/6? No, but misapply visibility/shape_ok, leading to wrong changes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly extracts 8-connected components and checks visibility/bg exclusion, but fails all training due to over-changing (e.g., turns non-qualifying greens/oranges to 3/5 instead of 0) and buggy flood-fill.
 * Train1 (bg=8): Generated fills too many 0s with 5 (e.g., row3 col9=5 vs exp=0; row6 col2=5 vs exp=0), changes some 1s/5s incorrectly (but 1s should be seeds?); keeps 2s but exp clears some areas to 0 without filling; special 2 logic misfires (bottom 2s changed to 3? but exp keeps 2s); shape_ok allows wrong vertical stacks as 5.
 * Train2 (bg=9): Generated changes top 7s to nothing (stay 7? but exp=3), turns some 4s to 5 correctly but misses others (e.g., row1 col10=4->? exp=5, but row2 col11-12=6 stay 6 ok); over-applies 3 to wrong 3/7 spots (e.g., row1 col3-4=3 ok, but row2 col7-8=7 vs exp=3); flood-fill absent or weak, leaving no extra 5s where exp has them (e.g., row1 col10=5).
 * Train3 (bg=7): Generated changes some 6s/1s to 3 incorrectly (e.g., row1-2 col4-5=3 ok, but row4 col2=6->? exp=5; row8 col1-2=6->? gen keeps 6 vs exp=5); misses turning vertical 6s/1s to 5 (e.g., left column 6s stay 6, but exp=5 for some); special 2 not applied (correct, but bottom 2s stay 2 ok); no flood-fill evident, as exp has 5s in empty spots but gen lacks them.
 * Overall: Visibility checks work (top/left detect edges), but shape_ok too permissive (allows non-wide as 5/3 wrongly); size limits too strict/loose; flood-fill spreads everywhere, filling "visible" 0s that should stay 0 (e.g., holes behind objects); doesn't clear non-qualifying objects to 0 (keeps originals like 5/1 where exp=0).
 * extract_components is essential and correct for grouping; get_bbox_and_size useful for h/w; visibility funcs good but has_right_visible underused/misapplied in shape_ok.
 * change_green/orange apply changes but wrong conditions (e.g., Train1 changes isolated 5s? to 5 redundantly); don't handle 1 as seed (keep as-is?).
 * Missed: Selective 0-to-5 only in "shadows" (e.g., below/right of objects, not above/left); components of same color but disconnected treated separately (ok, but aggregate? No).
 * Unknown: Why Train1 exp has 0s in a "stem" under 2s (not filled), but gen fills to 5; possibly flood only from changed 3/5, not original 1/5.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows scattered 5s (e.g., row8-10 has 5s in middle, likely from orange change) and some flood-fill (e.g., row5 col22-23=1? Wait, output has 1s persisting, but flood from them?); however, large areas of 0-implied (not shown, but gen has 4 bg everywhere else) suggest under-filling, while visible 1s/9s aren't cleared/changed properly (e.g., top 1s should be green? but bg=4, 1 is green, top-visible, size? If small/wide, to 3, then flood below to 5, but gen keeps 1s and adds random 5s). It over-relies on existing 5s for flood (row8 col6-8=5, probably wrong change of ? color), missing expected 0s in paths/holes (e.g., row12 col7-8=1s stay, but exp likely 0 or 5 shadow). Doesn't account for large grid (30 cols?); components like horizontal 1s (row3 col5-12) should be wide green to 3, flooding below, but gen keeps 1s. Looks like partial visibility detection but no clearing to 0, leading to messy unchanged areas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 2D list of integers representing colored cells (with 0 as empty, a background color b, and various foreground colors), and the goal is to produce an output grid by recoloring connected components of foreground colors to 3 or 5 based on rules involving their color parity, position (e.g., near the top), visibility from top or left edges (unobstructed by other non-background non-empty cells), and special cases (e.g., for specific color-background pairs or bottom-touching), followed by flood-filling remaining empty (0) cells connected to "seed" colors {1,3,5} with color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must consider all 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells correctly.
 * Background b is always the top-left cell value; ignore it and 0s when collecting used colors or checking obstructions.
 * For odd foreground colors (c % 2 == 1, excluding b and special case c=1 when b=8): recolor entire component to 3 only if it's near the top (min row index <=3) AND fully top-visible (at least one cell in the component has no non-b non-0 cells above it in its column).
 * For even foreground colors (c % 2 == 0, excluding b, c=2, and special case c=6 when b=9): recolor entire component to 5 only if near the top (min row <=3) AND (top-visible OR left-visible, where left-visible means at least one cell has no non-b non-0 cells to its left in its row).
 * Special case for c=2 when b=8: recolor to 3 if the component touches near the bottom (max row >= n-3), regardless of other rules.
 * Flood-fill only affects 0s: start from all cells already colored 1,3, or 5 (seeds), and fill adjacent (8 directions) 0s with 5, propagating to connected empties—but do not overwrite existing non-0 cells, and ensure it's a proper BFS flood to handle disconnected empty regions (only those touching seeds get filled).
 * Subtlety: Visibility checks must scan strictly above/left in the column/row, stopping at any obstructing cell (non-b and >0); if any cell in component is visible, the whole component qualifies.
 * Easy to miss: Rules are applied in sequence (special first, then odds to 3, then evens to 5), but components are extracted from the original input grid, not the modified output, to avoid interference; also, used colors exclude b and 0.
 * Flood-fill must not fill isolated 0s not connected to seeds; in some cases, 0s remain if not reachable.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18 for train1, 15x15 for train2, larger for test); rules like row thresholds (<=3 or >=n-3) are relative but fixed (top=3 rows, bottom=last 3 rows?).
 * No recoloring for certain pairs (e.g., skip c=1 if b=8 for odd rule; skip c=6 if b=9 for even rule), suggesting puzzle-specific exceptions to avoid over-recoloring.
 * Output keeps background and unchanged cells as-is, only modifies qualifying components and connected 0s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, used colors, and 8-connected components; extract_components is essential and works well for grouping.
 * Odd color rule partially works: in train3 (correct), it likely applied top-visible + near-top to color odds to 3 appropriately.
 * Even color rule has issues: in train1, it colored some evens to 5 where expected keeps 0s or originals (e.g., generated row3 col16=5 but expected 0; row4 col13=5 but expected 0), suggesting over-application or wrong visibility check.
 * Special c=2 b=8 rule works in train1: bottom 2's correctly to 3 (e.g., row14 col10-11=3 in both), but interacts badly with flood-fill, leading to extra 5's nearby.
 * In train2 (b=9), even rule skipped c=6 correctly (no recolor), but mismatches like row2 col13=5 generated vs 4 expected (possibly a 6 or 4 component miscolored; unknown why, as input not shown but output differs); also row3 col13=5 vs 4, row4 col14=5 vs 9? Wait, expected row4 col14=9? No, expected row3 col13=6? Wait, details fuzzy but clear recoloring error for evens/4/6.
 * Flood-fill is helpful but buggy: in train1, it over-fills 0s to 5 in areas not intended (e.g., row3 col14=5 vs expected 0; row5 col2=5 vs 0; row6 col2=0 expected but generated 5? Wait, generated row5 col2=5 vs expected 0), possibly because seeds include post-recolor 3/5, but queue init only fills direct adjacents initially, then propagates—yet misses some isolations or overreaches due to 8-dir.
 * touches_bottom is useful for special bottom rule but threshold n-3 may be too loose (touches last 3 rows?); works for train1 bottom.
 * Visibility functions are core but subtle bug: they return True if ANY cell in component is visible, which is correct per rules, but in train1, this may cause over-coloring if partial visibility triggers whole comp.
 * Overall, sequence of applying rules (special -> odds -> evens) is good, but exceptions like skipping c=1 b=8 and c=6 b=9 are incomplete—train2 fails suggest more specials needed (e.g., for 4?).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though flood_fill needs fix for proper seed-adjacency without overfill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (on a ~30x30 grid with b=4, colors including 1,3,5,9) applies rules but over-fills with 5's extensively, e.g., large areas of original 3's and 1's remain but many 0's (implied in input) are 5, and some 9's stay—however, it does not look fully correct because odd colors like 1 and 3 should be checked for top-visibility and near-top to become 3, but generated keeps many 1's/3's unchanged (e.g., rows 2-3 full 3's stay 3, which might be correct if not visible, but row5 col6-7=4 stay? Wait, input has 4's as b); even 5's already present stay, but 9 (odd) in bottom areas like row5 col21-23=9 stay 9, possibly not near-top so no recolor—yet flood seems to have filled some but left others (e.g., row8 col20=1 stay, but adjacent 0's? to 5).
 * Mismatches likely: if input has near-top 1's (odd) with top-visible, they should become 3 but stay 1 in generated (e.g., row5 col2-3=1 stay); 9's (odd) near bottom stay 9 correctly (not near-top), but if any top-visible 9 near top, should be 3—generated doesn't change them, suggesting rule application missed some components.
 * Flood-fill appears to have worked partially (many 5's in empty areas connected to seeds like existing 5's in row8 col6-8), but if there are isolated 0's not touching 1/3/5 post-recolor, they should remain 0—generated seems to fill too much, similar to train1 overfill issue.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (respects b=4, doesn't touch bottom specials since no 2, keeps non-qualifying components), but likely incorrect due to under-recoloring odds (e.g., visible 1's/9's not to 3) and potential flood overreach; without expected, hard to confirm, but pattern suggests rules need tuning for larger grids or more color interactions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs/objects) of specific colors in a background grid, evaluate their visibility from edges (top, left, right, bottom), and transform them to new colors (e.g., 3 or 5) based on shape ratios (width vs height), visibility conditions, and background-specific rules, before performing a flood fill from certain seed values (odd numbers like 1,3,5,7,9) to fill empty (0) spaces with 5, likely simulating some kind of object occlusion or rendering in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals) groups of the same non-background, non-zero value; empty spaces are 0.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0]; exclude bg from consideration for changes, and visibility checks ignore bg and 0.
 * For "green" colors (1,7,9 if not bg): Change to 3 if top-visible and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)).
 * For "orange" colors (4,6 if not bg): Change to 5 if (top or left visible) and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)); subtle: this seems to target horizontal-ish bars or protrusions.
 * Special case if bg==8: Change 2-components to 3 if bottom-visible (perhaps shadows or ground-level objects).
 * Flood fill: Starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9}, spreads to adjacent 0s (8 directions) filling with 5, but only if not visited; subtle: this might simulate filling hidden/empty areas behind visible objects, but it can overfill if seeds are misplaced.
 * Visibility: A component is "top-visible" if any cell has no non-bg/non-0 above it in the same column; similar for left (same row left), right (same row right), bottom (below).
 * Subtleties: Changes use a dict to avoid overwriting; components must be non-empty; shape ratio uses bounding box (min/max i/j +1 for h/w); easy to miss: visibility is per-cell then any in component, and changes only if do_change condition met; flood fill uses BFS but seeds include post-change values, so order matters (changes before fill); bg can be colors like 4,8,9 affecting which are "greens/oranges"; no diagonal-only connections—full 8-way; potential over-changing if multiple rules overlap; empty grid areas stay bg unless filled.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle variable grid sizes; ensure copy_grid preserves original; visited prevents re-flood; but flood seeds include 5 which might self-propagate if adjacent to 0; rules seem asymmetric (favor horizontal changes, right/bottom less prioritized); test inputs may have no 0s initially, so fill only creates if changes introduce them? No—changes replace to 3/5, fill only targets existing 0s; subtle miss: expected outputs have 0s where generated has 5/3, suggesting changes should introduce 0s or not fill certain areas.

 * Failed Training 1: Generated filled areas with 5 and changed to 3 where expected has 0s and 2/5; specifically, upper blob (likely 2?) changed incorrectly to 3/5 instead of keeping/changing to 2 with 0s for hidden parts; flood fill over-applied 5 to what should be 0s; bottom 3s correct, but side 1s unchanged correctly; unknown why 2 not handled as special (bg=8 rule applied but wrong visibility?).
 * Failed Training 2: Generated kept some 5/3 but misplaced 4/6 vs expected (e.g., row 5 col 1-2: generated 5,5 expected 4,6; row 12 col 5: generated 4 expected 4 but surrounding mismatches); changes to 5/3 over-applied to vertical-ish components; flood fill didn't create 0s, but expected has no 0s—issue is wrong color swaps (e.g., 6s became 5?); bg=9, so greens=1,7 but input has 3,5,6,4,7—3 not changed, but oranges=4,6 changed wrong.
 * extract_components is essential and correct (used successfully in the correct example 3).
 * Visibility functions are helpful but subtle bug: they check per-cell but return if ANY visible, which is correct, but in train1, top_vis likely true but do_change wrong for vertical blobs.
 * Flood fill is mostly helpful but unhelpful in cases with no 0s (does nothing, correct) or overfills post-change seeds; in train1, it filled what should be 0s (perhaps changes didn't introduce 0s, but expected has them—suggests rule should set some to 0 instead of 3/5).
 * Changes dict avoids overlaps, helpful; greens/oranges filtering by !=bg is key but missed if bg in list (e.g., train2 bg=9 not in lists).
 * Overall: Partial rules for horizontal changes work (why example 3 passed), but vertical/square components not distinguished well; special bg=8 rule applied in train1 but wrong (changed 2 to 3, but expected kept 2 with 0s); no handling for keeping 0s or other colors like 2/5 unchanged.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have minimally changed the input (kept most 1,3,5,9 components as-is or swapped some 1/9 to 3 under rules), with no 0s introduced and flood fill doing nothing (since no 0s in input and changes don't create them), resulting in a grid full of 4(bg),1,3,5,9 without occlusions or empties.
 * Expected likely includes 0s in hidden areas (e.g., behind vertical 1s or 9s, similar to train1 where 0s represent occluded space), and possibly more changes to 5 for oranges (but bg=4, so oranges=6 only if present—input has none?); e.g., the large horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 stayed 3 (correct if not green), but vertical 9s in col 21-23 rows 5-20 probably should be partially 0 or changed if not top-visible; side 5s in row8 col6-8 stayed, but if left-visible and wide, should be 5? Wait, already 5; overall, lacks 0s where components overlap shadows, and flood fill missed because no seeds hit 0s—suggests rules need to set some component parts to 0 for depth/occlusion, not just color swap; unknown exact diffs without input grid, but output looks too "filled" vs expected sparse 0s in trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:49:15] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with background as the dominant color and 0 as empty space) to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, recolor them based on visibility rules from the top, left, or right edges (ignoring background and empty cells), apply special rules for certain colors like 2, and then flood-fill empty (0) spaces connected to specific "seed" colors to recolor them, likely simulating some kind of visibility or occlusion in a visual diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must consider all eight directions to group touching cells of the same color correctly.
 * Visibility checks: For top visibility, check if any cell in the component has only background or empty above it in the same column; similar for left (same row, leftward) and right (same row, rightward). Non-empty, non-background cells block visibility.
 * Recoloring logic: Odd original colors (except possibly 1) seem to map to 3 if visible from left or (top with conditions like width >2 or not right-visible or at top row); even to 5. But this is inconsistent across examples—e.g., color 1 stays 1 or becomes visible without change in some cases.
 * Special rule for color 2: When background is 8 and the component touches near the bottom (e.g., row >= n-4), recolor to 3; otherwise, it may stay 2 or follow other rules, but it's skipped in main loop.
 * Used colors are non-background, positive cells; background is g[0][0], assumed uniform.
 * Flood fill: Only fills 0s connected (8-way) to seeds {1,3,5,7,9} with 5, but this seems overly aggressive and incorrect—expected outputs show many 0s remaining unfilled, and fills should perhaps be more selective (e.g., only certain areas or not at all in some cases). Seeds include recolored cells, so order matters.
 * Grids vary in size; assume rectangular, no wrapping.
 * Subtle: Some components like 1 or 6 may not recolor at all if not visible or per rules; empty spaces (0s) inside/outside objects matter for connectivity but aren't filled unless connected to seeds post-recoloring.
 * Potential misses: Width calculation (max_j - min_j +1) for conditions; min_i==0 for top-row priority; right visibility blocks some top-based recoloring.
 * Flood fill starts from seeds but uses directions including diagonals, and marks with 5, but visited prevents requeue—however, it seeds from all adjacent 0s initially, which may overfill.
 * Color 2 often remains 2 in expected, except in special cases; other evens/odds have specific mappings only if visible.

                comp = []
                q = collections.deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                comp.append((i, j))
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == target:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            comp.append((nx, ny))
                if comp:
                    comps.append(comp)
    return comps
```
(This extracts 8-connected components for a target color; essential for identifying objects.)

```python
def has_top_visible(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], b: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    for i, j in comp:
        vis = True
        for k in range(i):
            if g[k][j] != b and g[k][j] != 0:
                vis = False
                break
        if vis:
            return True
    return False

def has_left_visible(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], b: int) -> bool:
    m = len(g[0])
    for i, j in comp:
        vis = True
        for l in range(j):
            if g[i][l] != b and g[i][l] != 0:
                vis = False
                break
        if vis:
            return True
    return False

def has_right_visible(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], b: int) -> bool:
    m = len(g[0])
    for i, j in comp:
        vis = True
        for l in range(j + 1, m):
            if g[i][l] != b and g[i][l] != 0:
                vis = False
                break
        if vis:
            return True
    return False
```
(These check visibility from edges for a component; core to recoloring decisions, though conditions for use need refinement.)

```python
def flood_fill_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]], seeds: Set[int]) -> None:
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    q = collections.deque()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                        out[ni][nj] = 5
                        visited[ni][nj] = True
                        q.append((ni, nj))
    while q:
        i, j = q.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                out[ni][nj] = 5
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                q.append((ni, nj))
```
(This performs 8-connected flood fill from seeds to fill 0s with 5; helpful but likely broken as it overfills—expected outputs retain many 0s, so may need different seeds, fill color, or connectivity rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt processes components and visibility correctly in structure but fails recoloring logic: skips color 2 in main loop but applies special bottom-touch rule for bg=8, which works partially but doesn't match all cases (e.g., in Train 1, bottom 2s become 3 but upper 2s stay 2 while expected keeps them 2).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated fills many internal 0s with 5 (e.g., rows 3-8, cols 9-13) where expected keeps 0; recolors left 2s to nothing (stay 2? but expected 2); changes positions (3,3)-(3,4) to 5 where expected 0; (9,3)-(10,4) to 3 where expected 1; overfills right column with 5s correctly in some spots but adds extras.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated keeps some 4/6/7 as-is or recolors wrongly (e.g., row 5 col 1-3 as 5,5,5 where expected 4,6,6; row 13 col 12-13 as 3,3 where expected 7,7); flood fill adds 5s in wrong places like row 0 col 6; bottom 3s wrong (expected 7,7).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated recolors some 6s to nothing or wrong (e.g., row 6 col 14 as 5 where expected 6; row 12 col 16 as 5 where expected 6); keeps most but flood-fills extras like row 4 col 2 as 5 (expected 5? wait similar); row 16 col 3 as 6 where expected 6 but context wrong; special 2s at bottom stay 2 correctly but some 5s overplaced.
 * Recoloring condition "if left_vis or (top_vis and (w > 2 or not right_vis or min_i == 0))" is too permissive, leading to over-recoloring odds to 3 and evens to 5; doesn't handle color 1 (stays?), 6,7,9 properly—e.g., 1 often stays 1 if visible.
 * Flood fill with seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and fill to 5 is unhelpful/broken: overfills connected 0s in all trains (e.g., Train 1 fills object interiors that should stay 0; Train 2 fills unrelated areas); perhaps seeds should be edge-visible only, or no fill at all, or fill to background/different color.
 * extract_components is helpful and correct for grouping; visibility functions are mostly correct but right_vis check is per-cell from right, which may not align with full component visibility.
 * Special rule for 2 only when bg=8 and bottom-touch is partially helpful but too narrow—Train 3 (bg=7) keeps 2s as 2 without change, suggesting 2 often unchanged unless specific.
 * Used set collection is good but skips b and 0 correctly; however, processing order (for c in used, skipping 2) causes issues if 2 interacts with visibility for others.
 * No handling for color 4/6/9 specifics; e.g., in Train 2, 4s seem to stay or become visible without recolor in some paths.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It recolors long horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 to 3 (likely odd color visible from top/left), but keeps many 3s as 3 throughout without change, suggesting the original grid has many 3s that stay; however, 1s stay 1, 5s appear in some clusters (e.g., row 8 col 6-8), 9s in bottom-right, but flood fill seems absent (no 5s filling 0s, assuming originals have 0s—output shows no 0s visible, but likely over-recolored or filled wrongly).
 * Compared to patterns in trains, it under-fills: Expected likely retains internal 0s (like Train 1's object holes) but this seems to have recolored components like vertical 3s on left to 3, scattered 1s stay, but 5s/9s placed without clear visibility (e.g., row 12 col 13-15 as 9s may be even color visible from right?); no massive 5-fills, which is better than trains but still mismatches if 0s should remain.
 * Subtleties missed: Test has large grid (30 cols?), complex nested components (e.g., 1s inside 3s/5s); output treats 3s as visible (stay/change?), but if core rule is to highlight visible fronts (3 left/top, 5 right/bottom?), this partially does but ignores depths/occlusions fully.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (components extracted, some recolored by visibility) but likely wrong in not filling 0s selectively and over-retaining originals like 3s/1s without occlusion checks; e.g., bottom 9s may be back-facing (should be 5?), and no special for 2 (none present).

[2025-10-03 11:49:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where regions of uniform colors represent connected components (blobs) that must be recolored based on structural rules, likely modeling plant-like objects such as leaves (colored 3), stems or branches (colored 5), flowers or centers (possibly 1 or 2), and empty spaces (0), while preserving the background color (b, e.g., 8, 9, 7, 4) and avoiding recoloring irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (b) is the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test); never recolor it, and use it to define "non-background" for adjacency checks.
 * Identify 2x2 squares of the same non-b, non-0 color c; recolor them to 3 (green/leaves) only if they have horizontal adjacency to a non-b, non-c cell (subtle: check left/right for each of the 4 cells in the square, but code checks only horizontal, missing vertical/diagonal adjacencies that might be required).
 * Stem color is the first non-b, non-3 color (including 0) that is 4-way adjacent to any 3; then recolor entire connected components (4-way) of that stem color to 5 if the component is in the same row as a 3 OR 8-way adjacent to a 3 (subtle: components must satisfy both conditions in some cases, but code uses OR, leading to over-coloring; also, prioritize "first" stem by iterating used colors + 0).
 * For blue (hardcoded as 1), recolor 0-components (4-way connected) to 5 if attached 4-way to blue AND have at least one upward (north) neighbor that is blue (subtle: "upward attachment" means specifically checking above each cell in the component, not just any attachment).
 * Isolated single 0 cells (size-1 components with no 4-way adjacent non-b) get recolored to 5 (subtle: count adjacencies correctly during flood-fill, but code increments adj_non_b per neighbor, which may overcount if shared).
 * 0 represents empty/fillable space; it can act as a stem or be colored based on attachments, but not all 0s are recolored—only those meeting criteria (subtle: some 0s remain 0 if not isolated or not attached properly, e.g., in training 1 expected has many 0s unchanged).
 * Connected components are 4-way for flooding (up/down/left/right), but 8-way for some attachment checks to 3 (subtle: inconsistency in code's directions usage can miss diagonal touches).
 * Colors like 2,6 may represent petals or other elements; they aren't recolored in this attempt but appear in expectations (e.g., training 1 has 2s unchanged, training 2 has 6s, training 3 has 2s and 6s).
 * Order matters: Color 3s first, then stems to 5, then blue-attached 0s to 5, then isolated 0s to 5 (subtle: later steps may overwrite earlier ones if not careful, e.g., a 0 stem colored to 5 could conflict).
 * Grids vary in size (18x18 for training 1/3, 15x15 for 2, 30x30 for test); ensure n=len(g) handles all.
 * Subtle miss: In qualifying 2x2 for 3, adjacency check is flawed—code only checks horizontal left/right for the square's cells, but expectations suggest broader "exposed" or "leaf-like" criteria (e.g., not fully enclosed).
 * 0 can be part of larger structures but only recolored if criteria met; many 0s in expectations remain 0, indicating not all empties are stems or isolations.
 * Blue=1 interactions are specific to "upward" (vertical above), suggesting directionality like growth from base.
 * No recoloring of other colors (e.g., 2,6 stay as-is in expectations).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple

def is_valid(x: int, y: int, n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n

def get_used_colors(grid: List[List[int]], b: int) -> Set[int]:
    s: Set[int] = set()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != b:
                s.add(cell)
    return s
```

```python
directions4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
directions8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]
```
These are useful for validation, color extraction, and adjacency (4-way for components, 8-way for attachments). The color_qualifying_squares function is partially helpful for 2x2 detection but broken in adjacency logic (only horizontal checks, misses cases). Flood-fill with stack for components is good but needs better condition checks (e.g., for has_same_row and attached_to_green).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of rules.
 * Training 1: Generated over-colored many areas to 3 and 5 (e.g., bottom-right 3s and 5s where expected has 3s but keeps 0s and 2s unchanged; top-left 2x2 became 3 but expected keeps as 2; isolated 0s partially colored to 5 but some 5s appear where expected has 0s or 2s; stem logic misidentified, coloring extra 5s in rows without proper attachment).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Expected has 2s in top-left and bottom-left unchanged, many 0s preserved (e.g., vertical chains of 0s next to 2s stay 0, not 5); generated has 3s there and extra 5s (e.g., row 3 col 16-17 as 5 but expected 5 only in specific spots); unknown why stem=2 wasn't chosen correctly, leading to wrong 5 placements.
 * Training 2: Generated colored some 0s/empties to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 11-12 as 5 but expected 6; row 5 col 0 as 5 but expected 4; bottom 7s partially to 5 but expected keeps 7s); 3s correct in some 2x2 but missed propagating to adjacent 6s or 4s; blue=1 logic absent, so no upward 0 coloring; over-colored stems without row/adjacency checks.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Expected has 6s as a separate component (possibly petals) unchanged, 4s in specific chains, 7s at bottom; generated has 5s overwriting potential 6/4/7 areas (e.g., row 7 col 0 as 5 but expected 4); subtle: missed that some 3s attach to non-stem colors like 6, not coloring them to 5.
 * Training 3: Generated under-colored some areas (e.g., row 4 col 13-14 as 3 but expected 2; row 5 col 12 as 6 but expected 2; many 1s and 6s unchanged correctly but 5s over-applied in left column); stem logic colored extra 5s (e.g., row 10 col 14 as 5 but expected 6 or unchanged); isolated 0s not present, but blue=1 attachments missed upward specificity.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Expected has 2s in mid-left (rows 4-5 col 13-14) as a distinct element, 6s in chains (e.g., row 11 col 6-7 as 1 but wait, expected has 1s there? No, generated has 3s where expected 1/6; unknown why 2x2 detection failed for certain colors); 5s in top but generated spreads them incorrectly.
 * Overall: 2x2 to 3 works in some spots (e.g., training 1 top 3s) but over-applies without proper adjacency; stem selection picks wrong color (e.g., colors 0 as stem instead of 2); 0 to 5 rules partial (isolated good, but blue-upward misses directionality, and components over-colored if OR instead of AND); no handling for other colors like 2/6 as potential centers/petal unchanged.
 * Function color_qualifying_squares is partially helpful but broken (adjacency only horizontal, should be broader exposure check); get_used_colors and flood-fill stack are essential and correct for components.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but hardcoded blue=1 limits generality (if blue varies, fails); visited matrices reset per rule is good but inefficient for large grids like test.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3s in long horizontal/vertical lines (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 3-11 and 15-21 as solid 3s, but likely input has sparse colors needing only specific 2x2 qualified; this suggests 2x2 detection generalized wrongly to lines, not just squares).
 * Many 5s appear in scattered spots (e.g., row 8 col 6-7,9 as 5/0/5, but 0 remains—isolated rule partial; row 10 col 6-8 as 5s where possibly stem but over-colored without row match).
 * 1s and 9s preserved in clusters (good for unchanged elements), but 0s like row 8 col 7 remain 0 (correct if not isolated/attached), yet surrounding 5s suggest missed component merging.
 * Bottom sections (rows 18-25) have 5s in row 18-20 col 21-23, possibly from isolated 0s or stems, but chains of 1s and 9s unchanged—looks plausible for attachments but likely incorrect due to training failures (e.g., no upward blue checks visible, and 3s in row 25 col 13-15 may be wrong 2x2).
 * Overall, test output has too many 3s (line-filling instead of square-specific) and partial 5s, missing preservation of 0s/2-like elements; doesn't make sense as a "plant" structure—appears noisy, not structured like expectations' clean components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where components (connected groups of cells with the same non-background value) are identified and recolored based on visibility from the left or top edges, with special rules for certain backgrounds (e.g., bg=8 treats bottom 2's as 3's), followed by vertical downward filling and connected flooding to propagate color 5 into empty (0) areas from seeds like 1,3,5. The goal appears to be rendering or "painting" visible structures and their shadows or fills correctly, leaving internal holes or occluded areas as 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells properly; 4-connected would split some objects incorrectly.
 * Visibility from left: A component is "visible" if any of its cells has no non-background/non-zero cells to its left in the same row.
 * Visibility from top: Similar, but checked column-wise upward; however, the current check is per-cell and may overcount if not aggregated properly.
 * Recoloring rules: Odds (except 5) to 3 if left-visible or (top-visible with specific row/width conditions like min_i <=1 and width=1, or min_i=2 and width>1); evens (non-2) to 5 under similar visibility. For bg=8, override bottom-touching 2's to 3 regardless.
 * Post-recoloring: Vertical fill downward from {1,3,5} seeds into 0's (column-wise, like gravity), then flood-fill (8-directional) from {3,5} into remaining 0's, but this seems to overfill occluded/hole areas that should stay 0.
 * Subtleties: Internal 0's (holes) must remain 0 even if floodable; visibility conditions are heuristic and fail for complex shapes (e.g., the width-based top-visibility hacks suggest trying to detect "protrusions" but miss multi-row objects). Background varies (8,9,7,4), and present colors include evens/odds but exclude bg and sometimes 2/5. Bottom-touching for special cases uses a threshold like n-4, which is arbitrary and may not generalize. Flooding ignores boundaries, leading to spillover into unintended areas. No handling for diagonal occlusions or layered visibility. Ensure out-grid starts as copy to preserve originals before modifications.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import collections

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]

def get_size(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return len(g)

def extract_components(g: List[List[int]], target_val: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n, m = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] == target_val:
                component = []
                queue = collections.deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                component.append((i, j))
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == target_val:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                            component.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This extracts 8-connected components for a specific value, essential for isolating objects.)

```python
def get_bbox(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    min_i = min(i for i, j in comp)
    max_i = max(i for i, j in comp)
    min_j = min(j for i, j in comp)
    max_j = max(j for i, j in comp)
    return min_i, max_i, min_j, max_j
```
(Computes bounding box for component analysis, like width for visibility heuristics.)

```python
def has_top_visible(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    for i, j in comp:
        visible = True
        for k in range(i):
            if g[k][j] != bg and g[k][j] != 0:
                visible = False
                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False

def has_left_visible(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    m = len(g[0])
    for i, j in comp:
        visible = True
        for l in range(j):
            if g[i][l] != bg and g[i][l] != 0:
                visible = False
                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False
```
(These check per-component visibility from top/left by testing if any cell in the component has a clear line of sight; useful but overly permissive as they return True if ANY cell is visible, potentially recoloring whole components incorrectly.)

```python
def touches_bottom(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return max((i for i, j in comp), default=-1) >= n - 4
```
(Checks if component reaches near bottom; the n-4 threshold is specific/heuristic and may need tuning.)

```python
def fill_vertical_down(out: List[List[int]], seeds: set, target: int):
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])
    for j in range(m):
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                i += 1
                while i < n and out[i][j] == 0:
                    out[i][j] = target
                    i += 1
            i += 1
```
(Fills 0's downward from seed columns; simulates gravity but doesn't stop at obstacles, leading to overfill.)

```python
def flood_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]], seeds: set, target: int):
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    queue = collections.deque()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                        out[ni][nj] = target
                        visited[ni][nj] = True
                        queue.append((ni, nj))
    while queue:
        i, j = queue.popleft()
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                out[ni][nj] = target
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(8-directional flood from seeds into 0's; helpful for connected fills but overfills closed holes and ignores visibility/occlusion.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by over-recoloring and over-filling 0 areas that should remain empty (holes or shadows).
 * Train 1 (bg=8): Generated incorrectly recolored internal 5's (e.g., row 3 col 9=5 vs expected 0; row 4 col 9=5 vs 0) and filled vertical/horizontal 5's into what should be 0 holes (e.g., row 8 col 10=5 vs 0); special bottom 2-to-3 worked partially but flood overdid it in columns 16-17. Visibility heuristics failed to leave central voids empty.
 * Train 2 (bg=9): Generated mismatched recoloring, e.g., top row col 7-8=7 (odds) stayed 7 but expected 3; row 1 col 3-4=3 (odds to 3) but row 0 col 7-8 should be 3 not 7; evens like 4 stayed but some 6's (evens) not recolored to 5 where visible; vertical fill from 3/5 overfilled unrelated areas (e.g., row 2 col 13=5 vs expected 4).
 * Train 3 (bg=7): Generated left some odds as 3 where expected 5 (e.g., row 1 col 4-9=6? Wait, 6 even but code treats evens non-2 to 5; actually row 1 col 4-5=3 vs expected 5, suggesting wrong source sets—odds to 3 but some should be 5?); under-recolored top structures (row 1-2 col 4-9 should be 5's but partial 3's); no overfill noted but mismatches in blob shapes (e.g., row 2 col 10-13=6 vs expected 5).
 * extract_components and visibility functions are essential and mostly correct but visibility logic (e.g., width conditions) is too rigid/heuristic, missing multi-part objects or diagonal views.
 * fill_vertical_down and flood_from_seeds are helpful for propagation but broken for this puzzle as they don't respect occlusions/holes—cause main errors by filling everything reachable.
 * Special bg=8 handling for bottom 2's is relevant but threshold (n-4) is arbitrary and may not catch all "bottom" cases.
 * Overall, source sets (odds to green_src=3, evens non-2 to orange_src=5) seem partially right but fail when colors like 5/2 are present or visibility is blocked subtly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=4) does not look correct; it over-recolors large horizontal 3's in rows 2-4 cols 2-22 (likely odds visible from left/top) but leaves some internals as 3 instead of filling to 5 or leaving 0; vertical fills propagate 5's downward in cols 6-8 (from row 8 5's) and flood 5's into scattered areas (e.g., row 9 col 22-24=9? Wait, 9's stay but nearby 1's flood to 5 incorrectly, like row 5 col 21=9 vs should probably stay if occluded). It mismatches expected behavior by filling holes (e.g., around the 1's and 9's clusters in rows 5-7, where isolated 0's get 5'd) and not handling the complex L-shapes/ protrusions properly—e.g., the bottom-right 5's in row 19-21 seem underfilled compared to training patterns. Without exact expected, it appears over-aggressive like training fails, missing subtle occlusions in the dense 3/1/5/9 layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with background as the dominant color and 0 as empty space) to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, recolor them based on visibility rules from the top, left, or right edges (ignoring background and empty cells), apply special rules for certain colors like 2, and then flood-fill empty (0) spaces connected to specific "seed" colors to recolor them, likely simulating some kind of visibility or occlusion in a visual diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must consider all eight directions to group touching cells of the same color correctly.
 * Visibility checks: For top visibility, check if any cell in the component has only background or empty above it in the same column; similar for left (same row, leftward) and right (same row, rightward). Non-empty, non-background cells block visibility.
 * Recoloring logic: Odd original colors (except possibly 1) seem to map to 3 if visible from left or (top with conditions like width >2 or not right-visible or at top row); even to 5. But this is inconsistent across examples—e.g., color 1 stays 1 or becomes visible without change in some cases.
 * Special rule for color 2: When background is 8 and the component touches near the bottom (e.g., row >= n-4), recolor to 3; otherwise, it may stay 2 or follow other rules, but it's skipped in main loop.
 * Used colors are non-background, positive cells; background is g[0][0], assumed uniform.
 * Flood fill: Only fills 0s connected (8-way) to seeds {1,3,5,7,9} with 5, but this seems overly aggressive and incorrect—expected outputs show many 0s remaining unfilled, and fills should perhaps be more selective (e.g., only certain areas or not at all in some cases). Seeds include recolored cells, so order matters.
 * Grids vary in size; assume rectangular, no wrapping.
 * Subtle: Some components like 1 or 6 may not recolor at all if not visible or per rules; empty spaces (0s) inside/outside objects matter for connectivity but aren't filled unless connected to seeds post-recoloring.
 * Potential misses: Width calculation (max_j - min_j +1) for conditions; min_i==0 for top-row priority; right visibility blocks some top-based recoloring.
 * Flood fill starts from seeds but uses directions including diagonals, and marks with 5, but visited prevents requeue—however, it seeds from all adjacent 0s initially, which may overfill.
 * Color 2 often remains 2 in expected, except in special cases; other evens/odds have specific mappings only if visible.

```
(This performs 8-connected flood fill from seeds to fill 0s with 5; helpful but likely broken as it overfills—expected outputs retain many 0s, so may need different seeds, fill color, or connectivity rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt processes components and visibility correctly in structure but fails recoloring logic: skips color 2 in main loop but applies special bottom-touch rule for bg=8, which works partially but doesn't match all cases (e.g., in Train 1, bottom 2s become 3 but upper 2s stay 2 while expected keeps them 2).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated fills many internal 0s with 5 (e.g., rows 3-8, cols 9-13) where expected keeps 0; recolors left 2s to nothing (stay 2? but expected 2); changes positions (3,3)-(3,4) to 5 where expected 0; (9,3)-(10,4) to 3 where expected 1; overfills right column with 5s correctly in some spots but adds extras.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated keeps some 4/6/7 as-is or recolors wrongly (e.g., row 5 col 1-3 as 5,5,5 where expected 4,6,6; row 13 col 12-13 as 3,3 where expected 7,7); flood fill adds 5s in wrong places like row 0 col 6; bottom 3s wrong (expected 7,7).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated recolors some 6s to nothing or wrong (e.g., row 6 col 14 as 5 where expected 6; row 12 col 16 as 5 where expected 6); keeps most but flood-fills extras like row 4 col 2 as 5 (expected 5? wait similar); row 16 col 3 as 6 where expected 6 but context wrong; special 2s at bottom stay 2 correctly but some 5s overplaced.
 * Recoloring condition "if left_vis or (top_vis and (w > 2 or not right_vis or min_i == 0))" is too permissive, leading to over-recoloring odds to 3 and evens to 5; doesn't handle color 1 (stays?), 6,7,9 properly—e.g., 1 often stays 1 if visible.
 * Flood fill with seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and fill to 5 is unhelpful/broken: overfills connected 0s in all trains (e.g., Train 1 fills object interiors that should stay 0; Train 2 fills unrelated areas); perhaps seeds should be edge-visible only, or no fill at all, or fill to background/different color.
 * extract_components is helpful and correct for grouping; visibility functions are mostly correct but right_vis check is per-cell from right, which may not align with full component visibility.
 * Special rule for 2 only when bg=8 and bottom-touch is partially helpful but too narrow—Train 3 (bg=7) keeps 2s as 2 without change, suggesting 2 often unchanged unless specific.
 * Used set collection is good but skips b and 0 correctly; however, processing order (for c in used, skipping 2) causes issues if 2 interacts with visibility for others.
 * No handling for color 4/6/9 specifics; e.g., in Train 2, 4s seem to stay or become visible without recolor in some paths.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It recolors long horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 to 3 (likely odd color visible from top/left), but keeps many 3s as 3 throughout without change, suggesting the original grid has many 3s that stay; however, 1s stay 1, 5s appear in some clusters (e.g., row 8 col 6-8), 9s in bottom-right, but flood fill seems absent (no 5s filling 0s, assuming originals have 0s—output shows no 0s visible, but likely over-recolored or filled wrongly).
 * Compared to patterns in trains, it under-fills: Expected likely retains internal 0s (like Train 1's object holes) but this seems to have recolored components like vertical 3s on left to 3, scattered 1s stay, but 5s/9s placed without clear visibility (e.g., row 12 col 13-15 as 9s may be even color visible from right?); no massive 5-fills, which is better than trains but still mismatches if 0s should remain.
 * Subtleties missed: Test has large grid (30 cols?), complex nested components (e.g., 1s inside 3s/5s); output treats 3s as visible (stay/change?), but if core rule is to highlight visible fronts (3 left/top, 5 right/bottom?), this partially does but ignores depths/occlusions fully.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (components extracted, some recolored by visibility) but likely wrong in not filling 0s selectively and over-retaining originals like 3s/1s without occlusion checks; e.g., bottom 9s may be back-facing (should be 5?), and no special for 2 (none present).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to classify and recolor connected components (blobs) of specific colors based on rules like visibility from edges (top, left, right), size, position (e.g., near bottom or top rows), and background color, then flood-filling empty spaces (0's) with 5's starting from seed colors like 1,3,5,7,9 using 8-connectivity. The goal is to produce a modified grid where certain blobs are changed to 3 (green-like) or 5 (orange-like or fill), while preserving others, and ensuring the fill propagates correctly without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is determined from g[0][0] and excludes certain colors from processing (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} - {bg}).
 * Components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals), which is crucial for blob shapes but can merge unexpectedly if not handled.
 * Visibility rules: Top-visible if any cell in component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; left-visible if no blockers left in row; right-visible similarly but checking right side (note: right-visible check in code looks for blockers to the right, but logic may invert intent).
 * Size and position filters: For green (1,7,9), skip if >4 cells; use bounding box height/width (h,w) where w > h or (h==w and top position <=2 and not right-visible) triggers change to 3. For orange (4,6), skip if >6 cells or min row >3; change to 5 if top- or left-visible.
 * Special case for bg==8: Change bottom-touching 2-components to 3, but only if they touch near bottom (i >= n-5, which is arbitrary and may miss subtle bottom definitions).
 * Flood fill starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and spreads to adjacent 0's with 5, using 8-connectivity and visited to avoid revisits, but seeds themselves are not changed (only propagate from them).
 * Empty cells (0's) remain 0 unless filled; non-seed colors like 2,4,6 may stay or change based on rules.
 * Subtle: Flood fill uses directions including diagonals, but only fills 0's; it marks visited but sets to 5 immediately, which could block further spread if not careful. Also, components of size 1-4 for green or <=6 for orange with visibility/position are targeted, but over-application can change non-target blobs.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, 30x29?), so n,m dynamic; bottom-touching defined loosely (e.g., last 5 rows).
 * Potential misses: Right-visibility may be overused or inverted; flood fill seeds include changed colors (3,5), so order matters (changes before fill). No handling for vertical/horizontal dominance beyond w>h. Components must be fully connected; isolated cells count as components.

(Flood fills 0's from seeds using BFS with 8-connectivity; works but seeds propagate immediately from neighbors, which is correct if seeds are unchanged.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated incorrectly changed left-side 2-blob cells (rows 3-7, cols 2-3) to 5 instead of leaving as 0/2, over-applied orange rules or flood; bottom 2's (rows 14-15, cols 10-11) correctly to 3, but some 5's in cols 14-16 overfilled where expected 0's; right 1's stayed 1 (correct), but flood missed some 0's turning to 5.
 * In training example 1, special bg=8 rule for bottom 2's worked partially (changed to 3), but green/orange rules over-applied to non-visible or large components, e.g., vertical structure in cols 9-10 got 5's where expected 0's.
 * In training example 2 (bg=9), generated kept some 5's and 3's correctly top-left but failed on right-side 6's (row2 col11-12 as 5 instead of 6, row3 col13 as 5? Wait, expected has 6,6,4 so under-changed); orange 4/6 blobs in rows5-6 cols1-3 stayed 4/6 (correct) but flood over-applied 5's in row1 col6? No major flood issue, but component extraction missed splitting or visibility for mid-grid 6's.
 * In training example 2, green 3's top-left correct, but size filter skipped some small components incorrectly; right-bottom 7's stayed 7 (correct, as non-green/orange), but a 5 in row1 col10 incorrect (expected 9? bg).
 * In training example 3 (bg=7), generated under-applied 5's to left 6-blob (rows1-2 cols4-5 as 3? No, as 6, but expected 5's for top parts); over-kept 6's in rows3-9 col2-3 where expected 5's in some; bottom 2's stayed 2 (correct); 1's stayed 1 (correct, perhaps non-target).
 * In training example 3, touches_bottom not triggered correctly for some, and visibility (top/left) missed for horizontal dominance; flood fill under-applied, leaving some 0's? But outputs show no 0's visible, differences in 3 vs 5 for 6-blobs.
 * extract_components is helpful and seems correct (8-connectivity matches blob shapes in diffs).
 * has_top_visible, has_left_visible, has_right_visible are essential but right_visible logic checks for no blockers to right (meaning visible from right edge?), which may be inverted—generated often fails when right-visible should block change.
 * flood_fill_from_seeds works for propagation but starts only from seeds' neighbors, not overwriting seeds; in trains, it overfills some 0's to 5 where expected 0 (e.g., train1 left structure).
 * Special bg==8 rule partially worked (bottom 2 to 3) but applied too broadly; general green/orange rules too aggressive on size/position (e.g., min_i <=3 too loose, len>4 skip misses small visible).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but touches_bottom with fixed -5 is heuristic and not general (breaks for varying grid heights).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (30x29? grid, bg=4) has many 5's already placed (e.g., row8 cols6-8 as 5,5,5; row19-21 cols21-23 as 5's), suggesting pre-flood changes, but looks over-filled—e.g., scattered 5's in row8 col6-8 may be from orange rule on 5? Input has 5's? Wait, the "generated output" includes original colors like 9's,1's,4's unchanged in places, with some 5's added (e.g., row8), but no visible 0's left, implying flood filled everything adjacent to seeds.
 * Test output does not look fully correct: It preserves large 1-blobs (e.g., rows3-4 cols5-12 as 1's, expected perhaps change to 3 if small/visible green), but adds 5's in isolated spots like row8 cols6-8 (possibly erroneous flood from nearby 5? Input has 5 there? No, input not given, but output has them as 5 while surrounding 1's/4's); bottom rows have 5's in row19-21 cols21-23, which may be correct fill but over-spreads to row22 col21 as 1? Wait, row22 has 1's.
 * Test output misses potential 3-changes for top 9/1 blobs (rows2-3 cols2-5,14-21 as 9/1, visible from top/left but stayed, violating green rule if size<=4); flood seems to have filled some but left paths open incorrectly (e.g., row12 col24-26 as 9's, possibly unfilled 0's? But output shows no 0's, all filled or colored).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (fills from seeds like 1,5,9 to 5 in empties), but incorrect due to unchanged green-like blobs (1,9) that should be 3 if visible/small, and possible over-change of 4's to 5 without position check; looks like rules applied but visibility/size thresholds wrong, leading to under-classification.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid (numbers represent colors) to identify connected components of specific "object" colors, evaluate them based on visibility from edges (top/left/right), size, shape (width vs height), and position (e.g., touching bottom), then change qualifying components to new colors like 3 (for green-like objects) or 5 (for orange-like objects), while leaving non-qualifying areas as 0 (empty) or background. Finally, perform a limited flood-fill from certain seeds (1,3,5) to propagate 5 into adjacent 0s, but only in ways that simulate "shadows" or fills without over-spreading to block visibility rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; exclude it from object colors (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} minus {bg}; similar for orange {4,6}).
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals: up/down/left/right + diagonals), extracted via BFS/DFS flood-fill on exact color matches, ignoring bg and 0.
 * For green-like (1,7,9 except bg): Only small components (size <=4); must be top-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 above it in column); shape prefers wide (w > h) or left-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 to left in row) or single-cell square at top without right visibility; change to 3 if qualified.
 * For orange-like (4,6 except bg): Slightly larger (size <=6); must have top-visible or left-visible; same shape preference as green; change to 5.
 * Special case: If bg==8, change bottom-touching (max row >= n-4? but this threshold seems arbitrary/wrong) components of 2 to 3.
 * Flood-fill: Only from seeds {1,3,5}, but propagate ONLY to adjacent 0s (8 directions), setting them to 5; however, this must be constrained to avoid filling areas that should remain 0 (e.g., "open" spaces or behind objects); current implementation over-fills indiscriminately, ignoring visibility or object blocking.
 * 0s are empty space; non-qualifying components stay as original color or become 0? But in examples, some original colors persist (e.g., 1s,2s,6s), while others are cleared to 0 or changed.
 * Subtle: Visibility checks treat bg and 0 as "transparent" (don't block), but any other color blocks; right-visible checks from right edge inward, but rarely used.
 * Shape "ok" logic is convoluted: Allows squares only if single cell and top-row or not right-visible; this may miss vertical stacks.
 * Bottom-touching for special 2: Threshold n-4 seems too loose (e.g., touches near-bottom rows); likely should be stricter (e.g., row >=n-2).
 * Flood-fill starts from seeds but immediately sets neighbors to 5 and queues them, leading to full spread; probably needs to be directional (e.g., downward/rightward only) or blocked by objects.
 * Grids vary in size; n=rows, m=cols; assume rectangular.
 * Expected outputs preserve some original colors (e.g., 1s as seeds, 2s unchanged unless special, 6s as blockers) and leave strategic 0s unfilled (e.g., holes or paths).
 * Easy to miss: Components must be fully connected; isolated pixels count as size=1; over-aggressive size limits skip valid multi-part objects; flood-fill visits 0s but shouldn't cross object boundaries or fill top/left visible areas.

These functions are helpful for component extraction (8-connected BFS), bbox/size calc, and visibility checks (treating 0/bg as transparent). They correctly identify isolated groups but need integration with stricter rules.

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
```python
def flood_fill_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Over-fills all adjacent 0s from {1,3,5} without directionality or blocking, setting to 5 indiscriminately.
    # It queues and spreads fully, but examples show selective filling (e.g., only "shadow" areas, leaving holes as 0).
    # Not helpful as-is; needs constraints like downward-only from objects or avoiding top/left visible paths.
    # Don't use without major fixes.
```
```python
def change_special_two_components(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Only triggers if bg==8, changes bottom-touching 2s to 3, but threshold n-4 is arbitrary/wrong (e.g., Train1 expected keeps some 2s).
    # Also, in Train3 (bg=7), 2s are kept as-is in expected, but logic doesn't apply. Unhelpful without generalizing or fixing threshold.
```
The change_green/orange functions are partially helpful but have wrong size/shape thresholds (e.g., skip valid >4/6? No, but misapply visibility/shape_ok, leading to wrong changes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly extracts 8-connected components and checks visibility/bg exclusion, but fails all training due to over-changing (e.g., turns non-qualifying greens/oranges to 3/5 instead of 0) and buggy flood-fill.
 * Train1 (bg=8): Generated fills too many 0s with 5 (e.g., row3 col9=5 vs exp=0; row6 col2=5 vs exp=0), changes some 1s/5s incorrectly (but 1s should be seeds?); keeps 2s but exp clears some areas to 0 without filling; special 2 logic misfires (bottom 2s changed to 3? but exp keeps 2s); shape_ok allows wrong vertical stacks as 5.
 * Train2 (bg=9): Generated changes top 7s to nothing (stay 7? but exp=3), turns some 4s to 5 correctly but misses others (e.g., row1 col10=4->? exp=5, but row2 col11-12=6 stay 6 ok); over-applies 3 to wrong 3/7 spots (e.g., row1 col3-4=3 ok, but row2 col7-8=7 vs exp=3); flood-fill absent or weak, leaving no extra 5s where exp has them (e.g., row1 col10=5).
 * Train3 (bg=7): Generated changes some 6s/1s to 3 incorrectly (e.g., row1-2 col4-5=3 ok, but row4 col2=6->? exp=5; row8 col1-2=6->? gen keeps 6 vs exp=5); misses turning vertical 6s/1s to 5 (e.g., left column 6s stay 6, but exp=5 for some); special 2 not applied (correct, but bottom 2s stay 2 ok); no flood-fill evident, as exp has 5s in empty spots but gen lacks them.
 * Overall: Visibility checks work (top/left detect edges), but shape_ok too permissive (allows non-wide as 5/3 wrongly); size limits too strict/loose; flood-fill spreads everywhere, filling "visible" 0s that should stay 0 (e.g., holes behind objects); doesn't clear non-qualifying objects to 0 (keeps originals like 5/1 where exp=0).
 * extract_components is essential and correct for grouping; get_bbox_and_size useful for h/w; visibility funcs good but has_right_visible underused/misapplied in shape_ok.
 * change_green/orange apply changes but wrong conditions (e.g., Train1 changes isolated 5s? to 5 redundantly); don't handle 1 as seed (keep as-is?).
 * Missed: Selective 0-to-5 only in "shadows" (e.g., below/right of objects, not above/left); components of same color but disconnected treated separately (ok, but aggregate? No).
 * Unknown: Why Train1 exp has 0s in a "stem" under 2s (not filled), but gen fills to 5; possibly flood only from changed 3/5, not original 1/5.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows scattered 5s (e.g., row8-10 has 5s in middle, likely from orange change) and some flood-fill (e.g., row5 col22-23=1? Wait, output has 1s persisting, but flood from them?); however, large areas of 0-implied (not shown, but gen has 4 bg everywhere else) suggest under-filling, while visible 1s/9s aren't cleared/changed properly (e.g., top 1s should be green? but bg=4, 1 is green, top-visible, size? If small/wide, to 3, then flood below to 5, but gen keeps 1s and adds random 5s). It over-relies on existing 5s for flood (row8 col6-8=5, probably wrong change of ? color), missing expected 0s in paths/holes (e.g., row12 col7-8=1s stay, but exp likely 0 or 5 shadow). Doesn't account for large grid (30 cols?); components like horizontal 1s (row3 col5-12) should be wide green to 3, flooding below, but gen keeps 1s. Looks like partial visibility detection but no clearing to 0, leading to messy unchanged areas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 2D list of integers representing colored cells (with 0 as empty, a background color b, and various foreground colors), and the goal is to produce an output grid by recoloring connected components of foreground colors to 3 or 5 based on rules involving their color parity, position (e.g., near the top), visibility from top or left edges (unobstructed by other non-background non-empty cells), and special cases (e.g., for specific color-background pairs or bottom-touching), followed by flood-filling remaining empty (0) cells connected to "seed" colors {1,3,5} with color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must consider all 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells correctly.
 * Background b is always the top-left cell value; ignore it and 0s when collecting used colors or checking obstructions.
 * For odd foreground colors (c % 2 == 1, excluding b and special case c=1 when b=8): recolor entire component to 3 only if it's near the top (min row index <=3) AND fully top-visible (at least one cell in the component has no non-b non-0 cells above it in its column).
 * For even foreground colors (c % 2 == 0, excluding b, c=2, and special case c=6 when b=9): recolor entire component to 5 only if near the top (min row <=3) AND (top-visible OR left-visible, where left-visible means at least one cell has no non-b non-0 cells to its left in its row).
 * Special case for c=2 when b=8: recolor to 3 if the component touches near the bottom (max row >= n-3), regardless of other rules.
 * Flood-fill only affects 0s: start from all cells already colored 1,3, or 5 (seeds), and fill adjacent (8 directions) 0s with 5, propagating to connected empties—but do not overwrite existing non-0 cells, and ensure it's a proper BFS flood to handle disconnected empty regions (only those touching seeds get filled).
 * Subtlety: Visibility checks must scan strictly above/left in the column/row, stopping at any obstructing cell (non-b and >0); if any cell in component is visible, the whole component qualifies.
 * Easy to miss: Rules are applied in sequence (special first, then odds to 3, then evens to 5), but components are extracted from the original input grid, not the modified output, to avoid interference; also, used colors exclude b and 0.
 * Flood-fill must not fill isolated 0s not connected to seeds; in some cases, 0s remain if not reachable.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18 for train1, 15x15 for train2, larger for test); rules like row thresholds (<=3 or >=n-3) are relative but fixed (top=3 rows, bottom=last 3 rows?).
 * No recoloring for certain pairs (e.g., skip c=1 if b=8 for odd rule; skip c=6 if b=9 for even rule), suggesting puzzle-specific exceptions to avoid over-recoloring.
 * Output keeps background and unchanged cells as-is, only modifies qualifying components and connected 0s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, used colors, and 8-connected components; extract_components is essential and works well for grouping.
 * Odd color rule partially works: in train3 (correct), it likely applied top-visible + near-top to color odds to 3 appropriately.
 * Even color rule has issues: in train1, it colored some evens to 5 where expected keeps 0s or originals (e.g., generated row3 col16=5 but expected 0; row4 col13=5 but expected 0), suggesting over-application or wrong visibility check.
 * Special c=2 b=8 rule works in train1: bottom 2's correctly to 3 (e.g., row14 col10-11=3 in both), but interacts badly with flood-fill, leading to extra 5's nearby.
 * In train2 (b=9), even rule skipped c=6 correctly (no recolor), but mismatches like row2 col13=5 generated vs 4 expected (possibly a 6 or 4 component miscolored; unknown why, as input not shown but output differs); also row3 col13=5 vs 4, row4 col14=5 vs 9? Wait, expected row4 col14=9? No, expected row3 col13=6? Wait, details fuzzy but clear recoloring error for evens/4/6.
 * Flood-fill is helpful but buggy: in train1, it over-fills 0s to 5 in areas not intended (e.g., row3 col14=5 vs expected 0; row5 col2=5 vs 0; row6 col2=0 expected but generated 5? Wait, generated row5 col2=5 vs expected 0), possibly because seeds include post-recolor 3/5, but queue init only fills direct adjacents initially, then propagates—yet misses some isolations or overreaches due to 8-dir.
 * touches_bottom is useful for special bottom rule but threshold n-3 may be too loose (touches last 3 rows?); works for train1 bottom.
 * Visibility functions are core but subtle bug: they return True if ANY cell in component is visible, which is correct per rules, but in train1, this may cause over-coloring if partial visibility triggers whole comp.
 * Overall, sequence of applying rules (special -> odds -> evens) is good, but exceptions like skipping c=1 b=8 and c=6 b=9 are incomplete—train2 fails suggest more specials needed (e.g., for 4?).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though flood_fill needs fix for proper seed-adjacency without overfill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (on a ~30x30 grid with b=4, colors including 1,3,5,9) applies rules but over-fills with 5's extensively, e.g., large areas of original 3's and 1's remain but many 0's (implied in input) are 5, and some 9's stay—however, it does not look fully correct because odd colors like 1 and 3 should be checked for top-visibility and near-top to become 3, but generated keeps many 1's/3's unchanged (e.g., rows 2-3 full 3's stay 3, which might be correct if not visible, but row5 col6-7=4 stay? Wait, input has 4's as b); even 5's already present stay, but 9 (odd) in bottom areas like row5 col21-23=9 stay 9, possibly not near-top so no recolor—yet flood seems to have filled some but left others (e.g., row8 col20=1 stay, but adjacent 0's? to 5).
 * Mismatches likely: if input has near-top 1's (odd) with top-visible, they should become 3 but stay 1 in generated (e.g., row5 col2-3=1 stay); 9's (odd) near bottom stay 9 correctly (not near-top), but if any top-visible 9 near top, should be 3—generated doesn't change them, suggesting rule application missed some components.
 * Flood-fill appears to have worked partially (many 5's in empty areas connected to seeds like existing 5's in row8 col6-8), but if there are isolated 0's not touching 1/3/5 post-recolor, they should remain 0—generated seems to fill too much, similar to train1 overfill issue.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (respects b=4, doesn't touch bottom specials since no 2, keeps non-qualifying components), but likely incorrect due to under-recoloring odds (e.g., visible 1's/9's not to 3) and potential flood overreach; without expected, hard to confirm, but pattern suggests rules need tuning for larger grids or more color interactions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs/objects) of specific colors in a background grid, evaluate their visibility from edges (top, left, right, bottom), and transform them to new colors (e.g., 3 or 5) based on shape ratios (width vs height), visibility conditions, and background-specific rules, before performing a flood fill from certain seed values (odd numbers like 1,3,5,7,9) to fill empty (0) spaces with 5, likely simulating some kind of object occlusion or rendering in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals) groups of the same non-background, non-zero value; empty spaces are 0.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0]; exclude bg from consideration for changes, and visibility checks ignore bg and 0.
 * For "green" colors (1,7,9 if not bg): Change to 3 if top-visible and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)).
 * For "orange" colors (4,6 if not bg): Change to 5 if (top or left visible) and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)); subtle: this seems to target horizontal-ish bars or protrusions.
 * Special case if bg==8: Change 2-components to 3 if bottom-visible (perhaps shadows or ground-level objects).
 * Flood fill: Starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9}, spreads to adjacent 0s (8 directions) filling with 5, but only if not visited; subtle: this might simulate filling hidden/empty areas behind visible objects, but it can overfill if seeds are misplaced.
 * Visibility: A component is "top-visible" if any cell has no non-bg/non-0 above it in the same column; similar for left (same row left), right (same row right), bottom (below).
 * Subtleties: Changes use a dict to avoid overwriting; components must be non-empty; shape ratio uses bounding box (min/max i/j +1 for h/w); easy to miss: visibility is per-cell then any in component, and changes only if do_change condition met; flood fill uses BFS but seeds include post-change values, so order matters (changes before fill); bg can be colors like 4,8,9 affecting which are "greens/oranges"; no diagonal-only connections—full 8-way; potential over-changing if multiple rules overlap; empty grid areas stay bg unless filled.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle variable grid sizes; ensure copy_grid preserves original; visited prevents re-flood; but flood seeds include 5 which might self-propagate if adjacent to 0; rules seem asymmetric (favor horizontal changes, right/bottom less prioritized); test inputs may have no 0s initially, so fill only creates if changes introduce them? No—changes replace to 3/5, fill only targets existing 0s; subtle miss: expected outputs have 0s where generated has 5/3, suggesting changes should introduce 0s or not fill certain areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) passed Training example 3 (correct output matched), showing core component extraction, visibility, and flood fill work in some cases.
 * Failed Training 1: Generated filled areas with 5 and changed to 3 where expected has 0s and 2/5; specifically, upper blob (likely 2?) changed incorrectly to 3/5 instead of keeping/changing to 2 with 0s for hidden parts; flood fill over-applied 5 to what should be 0s; bottom 3s correct, but side 1s unchanged correctly; unknown why 2 not handled as special (bg=8 rule applied but wrong visibility?).
 * Failed Training 2: Generated kept some 5/3 but misplaced 4/6 vs expected (e.g., row 5 col 1-2: generated 5,5 expected 4,6; row 12 col 5: generated 4 expected 4 but surrounding mismatches); changes to 5/3 over-applied to vertical-ish components; flood fill didn't create 0s, but expected has no 0s—issue is wrong color swaps (e.g., 6s became 5?); bg=9, so greens=1,7 but input has 3,5,6,4,7—3 not changed, but oranges=4,6 changed wrong.
 * extract_components is essential and correct (used successfully in the correct example 3).
 * Visibility functions are helpful but subtle bug: they check per-cell but return if ANY visible, which is correct, but in train1, top_vis likely true but do_change wrong for vertical blobs.
 * Flood fill is mostly helpful but unhelpful in cases with no 0s (does nothing, correct) or overfills post-change seeds; in train1, it filled what should be 0s (perhaps changes didn't introduce 0s, but expected has them—suggests rule should set some to 0 instead of 3/5).
 * Changes dict avoids overlaps, helpful; greens/oranges filtering by !=bg is key but missed if bg in list (e.g., train2 bg=9 not in lists).
 * Overall: Partial rules for horizontal changes work (why example 3 passed), but vertical/square components not distinguished well; special bg=8 rule applied in train1 but wrong (changed 2 to 3, but expected kept 2 with 0s); no handling for keeping 0s or other colors like 2/5 unchanged.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have minimally changed the input (kept most 1,3,5,9 components as-is or swapped some 1/9 to 3 under rules), with no 0s introduced and flood fill doing nothing (since no 0s in input and changes don't create them), resulting in a grid full of 4(bg),1,3,5,9 without occlusions or empties.
 * Expected likely includes 0s in hidden areas (e.g., behind vertical 1s or 9s, similar to train1 where 0s represent occluded space), and possibly more changes to 5 for oranges (but bg=4, so oranges=6 only if present—input has none?); e.g., the large horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 stayed 3 (correct if not green), but vertical 9s in col 21-23 rows 5-20 probably should be partially 0 or changed if not top-visible; side 5s in row8 col6-8 stayed, but if left-visible and wide, should be 5? Wait, already 5; overall, lacks 0s where components overlap shadows, and flood fill missed because no seeds hit 0s—suggests rules need to set some component parts to 0 for depth/occlusion, not just color swap; unknown exact diffs without input grid, but output looks too "filled" vs expected sparse 0s in trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 12:01:21] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images of plant-like structures (e.g., trees or foliage) where the goal is to transform an input grid by recoloring components (connected groups of cells) based on positional rules, visibility from edges, and adjacency to "seeds" (certain colors like 1,3,5), ultimately filling empty spaces (0s) connected to valid structures. The background color (b) influences specific rules, such as treating certain colors as potential leaves (3) or stems (5), while ignoring or skipping others like 2 unless special conditions apply.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-way connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells correctly; 4-way would miss diagonal connections.
 * Background (b) is the color at [0][0] and is ignored in visibility checks; empty cells (0) are not background but potential fillable space.
 * Visibility from top: A component has top visibility if at least one of its cells has no non-background/non-empty cells above it in the same column.
 * Visibility from left: Similar, no non-background/non-empty cells to the left in the same row.
 * For odd colors (1,3,5,7,9 excluding b): Change to 3 (likely "leaves") if min row <=2 (top-positioned), top-visible, and either left-visible or at row 0; stricter for color 1 (requires both visibilities).
 * Stem colors depend on b: empty for b=4/8, 4 for b=9, 6 for b=7; these change to 5 (likely "stems") if min row <=4, top-visible, and not touching right edge.
 * Special rule for b=8 and color 2: Change entire component to 3 if it touches the bottom (max row >= n-3, suggesting near-bottom but not exact edge; this may be off by 1-2 rows).
 * Second pass: Remaining stem-colored components (after first pass) change to 5 if any cell is adjacent (8-way) to a seed {1,3,5}.
 * Final flood fill: All 0s connected (8-way) to any seed {1,3,5} become 5; this must start from 0s adjacent to seeds and propagate, but only after prior changes.
 * Subtleties: min_row checks are strict (e.g., >4 skips entirely); right-touch is any cell on rightmost column; flood fill uses visited to avoid revisiting but starts incorrectly (sets to 5 before queuing, but checks adjacency first); no handling for color 2 in general cases; odds like 7/9 may need looser left-vis rules; bottom-touch for 2s may need adjustment (e.g., >=n-2 or component spanning); adjacency for stems is per-cell but triggers whole component; 0s not connected to seeds stay 0 (important for open spaces); b=4/7/8/9 have varying stem_cs, but code misses some (e.g., no stem for b=4); components extracted on original g first, then out for second pass, but flood on final out.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill queue starts only from adjacent 0s, but code has a bug—initial loop sets out[i][j]=5 and queues if adjacent, but visited is set, ok; however, it doesn't flood non-adjacent 0s correctly if chain; no reversal of changes; color 6 in train3 expected but not generated, suggesting missing stem handling or propagation for b=7; in train1, bottom 2s partially changed but not all in component; extra 5s in places that should be 0 (e.g., isolated or non-qualifying areas).

```

The flood fill in the main program is helpful but buggy in initialization (sets to 5 before full queuing; works but inefficient); uses deque for BFS.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies background b and skips it/0s in color sets and visibility.
 * Correctly uses 8-way connectivity for components, which is essential for blob shapes like the 2s in train1 or 6s in train3.
 * First pass changes some top-left odds to 3 correctly in parts (e.g., train1 top 1s stay but should propagate; train2 top 3s stay 3).
 * Special rule for b=8 color 2 partially works: changes some bottom 2s to 3 (e.g., train1 row14 3,3) but misses others in same component (row13 2,2 stay 2 instead of expected 3,3; likely touches_bottom threshold wrong, as max i=14 < n-3=15 for n=18).
 * Stem handling for b=7/9 adds stem_cs={6}/{4} and changes some to 5 if top-vis/not right-touch, but misses propagation (train3 generates no 6s to 5 in places like row5 col12=6 expected, instead 5 elsewhere; train2 row3 col5=5 generated but expected 4, suggesting over-change).
 * Second pass adj to seeds changes some stems to 5 (helpful for propagation), but skips if not qualifying in first pass.
 * Flood fill correctly spreads 5 to connected 0s adj to {1,3,5} (8-way), but overfills in train1 (e.g., row3 col14=5 generated vs 0 expected; row6 col2=5 gen vs 0 exp; isolated 0s filled wrongly) and train2 (row4 col5=9 gen? Wait no, but mismatches like row3 col5=5 vs4).
 * Train1 mismatches: Extra 5s in right column (e.g., row3 col14=5 vs0, row3 col16=5 ok but row4 col13=5 vs0, row5 col2=5 vs0); bottom 2s not fully to 3 (row13 col11-12=2,2 vs3,3); flood overfills vertical 0s on right that aren't connected to valid seeds.
 * Train2 mismatches: Overchanges potential stems (row3 col5=5 vs4, row4 col6=5 vs4? Expected row4 [9,9,9,5,9,9,4,...] gen [9,9,9,5,9,9,5,...] so col6=5 vs4); bottom 3s in row13 col10-11=3,3 gen? But expected row13 [9,9,4,4,4,7,7,9,9,7,7,9,7,7,9] no 3s there, wait gen has issues elsewhere like row5 col1=4 ok but overall wrong placements for 4/6.
 * Train3 mismatches: No 6s generated at all (expected 6s in row5 col12, row6 col11-12/14, row7 col14, etc., as stems); instead over-relies on 5s (e.g., row5 col12=2? Wait gen row5 [7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,2,2,7,...] vs exp [7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,2,2,...] so col12=5 vs6, and misses later 6s like row10 col10=6 exp vs5 gen); bottom 2s stay 2 ok, but no stem propagation to 6 then 5.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for identifying blobs.
 * has_top_visible and has_left_visible are helpful and seem accurate for edge visibility.
 * touches_bottom is helpful but likely broken (threshold n-3 too strict; in train1 n=18, max i=14 for 2s should trigger but doesn't fully).
 * get_adjacent_seed is helpful for second pass and flood init.
 * Overall, first pass min_row/top-vis rules partially work for leaves (3) but too strict/loose for stems; no handling for color 6/4 as intermediates in b=7/9; flood overfills non-connected 0s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies changes similar to training failures (e.g., many isolated 1s stay 1 but should perhaps propagate to 3/5 if qualifying; 3s at top-left stay 3 ok, but 9s in middle-right seem unchanged or partially to 5 wrongly, like row5 col21-23=9,9,9 gen vs likely need stem/leaf rules for b=4; flood to 5 in row8 col6-8=5,5,5 ok if adj to seeds, but row12 col13-15=9,9,9 stay vs possibly change; bottom row20-22 5,5,5 in col21-23 likely overfill if not connected; extra 5s in row8 col6-8 where input has ? but gen has them without clear seed adj; many 0s absent, replaced by 4s or 5s incorrectly, e.g., potential open spaces filled; for b=4 (no stem_cs), it skips stems but still changes odds to 3/5 wrongly (e.g., top 3s to ? stay, but 1s propagate poorly); looks like leaf changes partial but flood over-aggressive, missing that some 9s/1s are separate components not visible/adj. Make sure to account for b=4 having no stems (empty stem_cs correct, but odds overchanged) and larger grid needing efficient component extraction to handle 30x30 without missing large blobs like the right-side 1s/9s.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 12:01:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where regions of uniform colors represent connected components (blobs) that must be recolored based on structural rules, likely modeling plant-like objects such as leaves (colored 3), stems or branches (colored 5), flowers or centers (possibly 1 or 2), and empty spaces (0), while preserving the background color (b, e.g., 8, 9, 7, 4) and avoiding recoloring irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (b) is the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test); never recolor it, and use it to define "non-background" for adjacency checks.
 * Identify 2x2 squares of the same non-b, non-0 color c; recolor them to 3 (green/leaves) only if they have horizontal adjacency to a non-b, non-c cell (subtle: check left/right for each of the 4 cells in the square, but code checks only horizontal, missing vertical/diagonal adjacencies that might be required).
 * Stem color is the first non-b, non-3 color (including 0) that is 4-way adjacent to any 3; then recolor entire connected components (4-way) of that stem color to 5 if the component is in the same row as a 3 OR 8-way adjacent to a 3 (subtle: components must satisfy both conditions in some cases, but code uses OR, leading to over-coloring; also, prioritize "first" stem by iterating used colors + 0).
 * For blue (hardcoded as 1), recolor 0-components (4-way connected) to 5 if attached 4-way to blue AND have at least one upward (north) neighbor that is blue (subtle: "upward attachment" means specifically checking above each cell in the component, not just any attachment).
 * Isolated single 0 cells (size-1 components with no 4-way adjacent non-b) get recolored to 5 (subtle: count adjacencies correctly during flood-fill, but code increments adj_non_b per neighbor, which may overcount if shared).
 * 0 represents empty/fillable space; it can act as a stem or be colored based on attachments, but not all 0s are recolored—only those meeting criteria (subtle: some 0s remain 0 if not isolated or not attached properly, e.g., in training 1 expected has many 0s unchanged).
 * Connected components are 4-way for flooding (up/down/left/right), but 8-way for some attachment checks to 3 (subtle: inconsistency in code's directions usage can miss diagonal touches).
 * Colors like 2,6 may represent petals or other elements; they aren't recolored in this attempt but appear in expectations (e.g., training 1 has 2s unchanged, training 2 has 6s, training 3 has 2s and 6s).
 * Order matters: Color 3s first, then stems to 5, then blue-attached 0s to 5, then isolated 0s to 5 (subtle: later steps may overwrite earlier ones if not careful, e.g., a 0 stem colored to 5 could conflict).
 * Grids vary in size (18x18 for training 1/3, 15x15 for 2, 30x30 for test); ensure n=len(g) handles all.
 * Subtle miss: In qualifying 2x2 for 3, adjacency check is flawed—code only checks horizontal left/right for the square's cells, but expectations suggest broader "exposed" or "leaf-like" criteria (e.g., not fully enclosed).
 * 0 can be part of larger structures but only recolored if criteria met; many 0s in expectations remain 0, indicating not all empties are stems or isolations.
 * Blue=1 interactions are specific to "upward" (vertical above), suggesting directionality like growth from base.
 * No recoloring of other colors (e.g., 2,6 stay as-is in expectations).

```
These are useful for validation, color extraction, and adjacency (4-way for components, 8-way for attachments). The color_qualifying_squares function is partially helpful for 2x2 detection but broken in adjacency logic (only horizontal checks, misses cases). Flood-fill with stack for components is good but needs better condition checks (e.g., for has_same_row and attached_to_green).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of rules.
 * Training 1: Generated over-colored many areas to 3 and 5 (e.g., bottom-right 3s and 5s where expected has 3s but keeps 0s and 2s unchanged; top-left 2x2 became 3 but expected keeps as 2; isolated 0s partially colored to 5 but some 5s appear where expected has 0s or 2s; stem logic misidentified, coloring extra 5s in rows without proper attachment).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Expected has 2s in top-left and bottom-left unchanged, many 0s preserved (e.g., vertical chains of 0s next to 2s stay 0, not 5); generated has 3s there and extra 5s (e.g., row 3 col 16-17 as 5 but expected 5 only in specific spots); unknown why stem=2 wasn't chosen correctly, leading to wrong 5 placements.
 * Training 2: Generated colored some 0s/empties to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 11-12 as 5 but expected 6; row 5 col 0 as 5 but expected 4; bottom 7s partially to 5 but expected keeps 7s); 3s correct in some 2x2 but missed propagating to adjacent 6s or 4s; blue=1 logic absent, so no upward 0 coloring; over-colored stems without row/adjacency checks.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Expected has 6s as a separate component (possibly petals) unchanged, 4s in specific chains, 7s at bottom; generated has 5s overwriting potential 6/4/7 areas (e.g., row 7 col 0 as 5 but expected 4); subtle: missed that some 3s attach to non-stem colors like 6, not coloring them to 5.
 * Training 3: Generated under-colored some areas (e.g., row 4 col 13-14 as 3 but expected 2; row 5 col 12 as 6 but expected 2; many 1s and 6s unchanged correctly but 5s over-applied in left column); stem logic colored extra 5s (e.g., row 10 col 14 as 5 but expected 6 or unchanged); isolated 0s not present, but blue=1 attachments missed upward specificity.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Expected has 2s in mid-left (rows 4-5 col 13-14) as a distinct element, 6s in chains (e.g., row 11 col 6-7 as 1 but wait, expected has 1s there? No, generated has 3s where expected 1/6; unknown why 2x2 detection failed for certain colors); 5s in top but generated spreads them incorrectly.
 * Overall: 2x2 to 3 works in some spots (e.g., training 1 top 3s) but over-applies without proper adjacency; stem selection picks wrong color (e.g., colors 0 as stem instead of 2); 0 to 5 rules partial (isolated good, but blue-upward misses directionality, and components over-colored if OR instead of AND); no handling for other colors like 2/6 as potential centers/petal unchanged.
 * Function color_qualifying_squares is partially helpful but broken (adjacency only horizontal, should be broader exposure check); get_used_colors and flood-fill stack are essential and correct for components.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but hardcoded blue=1 limits generality (if blue varies, fails); visited matrices reset per rule is good but inefficient for large grids like test.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3s in long horizontal/vertical lines (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 3-11 and 15-21 as solid 3s, but likely input has sparse colors needing only specific 2x2 qualified; this suggests 2x2 detection generalized wrongly to lines, not just squares).
 * Many 5s appear in scattered spots (e.g., row 8 col 6-7,9 as 5/0/5, but 0 remains—isolated rule partial; row 10 col 6-8 as 5s where possibly stem but over-colored without row match).
 * 1s and 9s preserved in clusters (good for unchanged elements), but 0s like row 8 col 7 remain 0 (correct if not isolated/attached), yet surrounding 5s suggest missed component merging.
 * Bottom sections (rows 18-25) have 5s in row 18-20 col 21-23, possibly from isolated 0s or stems, but chains of 1s and 9s unchanged—looks plausible for attachments but likely incorrect due to training failures (e.g., no upward blue checks visible, and 3s in row 25 col 13-15 may be wrong 2x2).
 * Overall, test output has too many 3s (line-filling instead of square-specific) and partial 5s, missing preservation of 0s/2-like elements; doesn't make sense as a "plant" structure—appears noisy, not structured like expectations' clean components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where components (connected groups of cells with the same non-background value) are identified and recolored based on visibility from the left or top edges, with special rules for certain backgrounds (e.g., bg=8 treats bottom 2's as 3's), followed by vertical downward filling and connected flooding to propagate color 5 into empty (0) areas from seeds like 1,3,5. The goal appears to be rendering or "painting" visible structures and their shadows or fills correctly, leaving internal holes or occluded areas as 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells properly; 4-connected would split some objects incorrectly.
 * Visibility from left: A component is "visible" if any of its cells has no non-background/non-zero cells to its left in the same row.
 * Visibility from top: Similar, but checked column-wise upward; however, the current check is per-cell and may overcount if not aggregated properly.
 * Recoloring rules: Odds (except 5) to 3 if left-visible or (top-visible with specific row/width conditions like min_i <=1 and width=1, or min_i=2 and width>1); evens (non-2) to 5 under similar visibility. For bg=8, override bottom-touching 2's to 3 regardless.
 * Post-recoloring: Vertical fill downward from {1,3,5} seeds into 0's (column-wise, like gravity), then flood-fill (8-directional) from {3,5} into remaining 0's, but this seems to overfill occluded/hole areas that should stay 0.
 * Subtleties: Internal 0's (holes) must remain 0 even if floodable; visibility conditions are heuristic and fail for complex shapes (e.g., the width-based top-visibility hacks suggest trying to detect "protrusions" but miss multi-row objects). Background varies (8,9,7,4), and present colors include evens/odds but exclude bg and sometimes 2/5. Bottom-touching for special cases uses a threshold like n-4, which is arbitrary and may not generalize. Flooding ignores boundaries, leading to spillover into unintended areas. No handling for diagonal occlusions or layered visibility. Ensure out-grid starts as copy to preserve originals before modifications.

                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This extracts 8-connected components for a specific value, essential for isolating objects.)

                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False
```
(These check per-component visibility from top/left by testing if any cell in the component has a clear line of sight; useful but overly permissive as they return True if ANY cell is visible, potentially recoloring whole components incorrectly.)

```python
def touches_bottom(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return max((i for i, j in comp), default=-1) >= n - 4
```
(Checks if component reaches near bottom; the n-4 threshold is specific/heuristic and may need tuning.)

                    i += 1
            i += 1
```
(Fills 0's downward from seed columns; simulates gravity but doesn't stop at obstacles, leading to overfill.)

def flood_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]], seeds: set, target: int):
    n = len(out)

                visited[ni][nj] = True
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(8-directional flood from seeds into 0's; helpful for connected fills but overfills closed holes and ignores visibility/occlusion.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by over-recoloring and over-filling 0 areas that should remain empty (holes or shadows).
 * Train 1 (bg=8): Generated incorrectly recolored internal 5's (e.g., row 3 col 9=5 vs expected 0; row 4 col 9=5 vs 0) and filled vertical/horizontal 5's into what should be 0 holes (e.g., row 8 col 10=5 vs 0); special bottom 2-to-3 worked partially but flood overdid it in columns 16-17. Visibility heuristics failed to leave central voids empty.
 * Train 2 (bg=9): Generated mismatched recoloring, e.g., top row col 7-8=7 (odds) stayed 7 but expected 3; row 1 col 3-4=3 (odds to 3) but row 0 col 7-8 should be 3 not 7; evens like 4 stayed but some 6's (evens) not recolored to 5 where visible; vertical fill from 3/5 overfilled unrelated areas (e.g., row 2 col 13=5 vs expected 4).
 * Train 3 (bg=7): Generated left some odds as 3 where expected 5 (e.g., row 1 col 4-9=6? Wait, 6 even but code treats evens non-2 to 5; actually row 1 col 4-5=3 vs expected 5, suggesting wrong source sets—odds to 3 but some should be 5?); under-recolored top structures (row 1-2 col 4-9 should be 5's but partial 3's); no overfill noted but mismatches in blob shapes (e.g., row 2 col 10-13=6 vs expected 5).
 * extract_components and visibility functions are essential and mostly correct but visibility logic (e.g., width conditions) is too rigid/heuristic, missing multi-part objects or diagonal views.
 * fill_vertical_down and flood_from_seeds are helpful for propagation but broken for this puzzle as they don't respect occlusions/holes—cause main errors by filling everything reachable.
 * Special bg=8 handling for bottom 2's is relevant but threshold (n-4) is arbitrary and may not catch all "bottom" cases.
 * Overall, source sets (odds to green_src=3, evens non-2 to orange_src=5) seem partially right but fail when colors like 5/2 are present or visibility is blocked subtly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=4) does not look correct; it over-recolors large horizontal 3's in rows 2-4 cols 2-22 (likely odds visible from left/top) but leaves some internals as 3 instead of filling to 5 or leaving 0; vertical fills propagate 5's downward in cols 6-8 (from row 8 5's) and flood 5's into scattered areas (e.g., row 9 col 22-24=9? Wait, 9's stay but nearby 1's flood to 5 incorrectly, like row 5 col 21=9 vs should probably stay if occluded). It mismatches expected behavior by filling holes (e.g., around the 1's and 9's clusters in rows 5-7, where isolated 0's get 5'd) and not handling the complex L-shapes/ protrusions properly—e.g., the bottom-right 5's in row 19-21 seem underfilled compared to training patterns. Without exact expected, it appears over-aggressive like training fails, missing subtle occlusions in the dense 3/1/5/9 layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with background as the dominant color and 0 as empty space) to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, recolor them based on visibility rules from the top, left, or right edges (ignoring background and empty cells), apply special rules for certain colors like 2, and then flood-fill empty (0) spaces connected to specific "seed" colors to recolor them, likely simulating some kind of visibility or occlusion in a visual diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must consider all eight directions to group touching cells of the same color correctly.
 * Visibility checks: For top visibility, check if any cell in the component has only background or empty above it in the same column; similar for left (same row, leftward) and right (same row, rightward). Non-empty, non-background cells block visibility.
 * Recoloring logic: Odd original colors (except possibly 1) seem to map to 3 if visible from left or (top with conditions like width >2 or not right-visible or at top row); even to 5. But this is inconsistent across examples—e.g., color 1 stays 1 or becomes visible without change in some cases.
 * Special rule for color 2: When background is 8 and the component touches near the bottom (e.g., row >= n-4), recolor to 3; otherwise, it may stay 2 or follow other rules, but it's skipped in main loop.
 * Used colors are non-background, positive cells; background is g[0][0], assumed uniform.
 * Flood fill: Only fills 0s connected (8-way) to seeds {1,3,5,7,9} with 5, but this seems overly aggressive and incorrect—expected outputs show many 0s remaining unfilled, and fills should perhaps be more selective (e.g., only certain areas or not at all in some cases). Seeds include recolored cells, so order matters.
 * Grids vary in size; assume rectangular, no wrapping.
 * Subtle: Some components like 1 or 6 may not recolor at all if not visible or per rules; empty spaces (0s) inside/outside objects matter for connectivity but aren't filled unless connected to seeds post-recoloring.
 * Potential misses: Width calculation (max_j - min_j +1) for conditions; min_i==0 for top-row priority; right visibility blocks some top-based recoloring.
 * Flood fill starts from seeds but uses directions including diagonals, and marks with 5, but visited prevents requeue—however, it seeds from all adjacent 0s initially, which may overfill.
 * Color 2 often remains 2 in expected, except in special cases; other evens/odds have specific mappings only if visible.

(This performs 8-connected flood fill from seeds to fill 0s with 5; helpful but likely broken as it overfills—expected outputs retain many 0s, so may need different seeds, fill color, or connectivity rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt processes components and visibility correctly in structure but fails recoloring logic: skips color 2 in main loop but applies special bottom-touch rule for bg=8, which works partially but doesn't match all cases (e.g., in Train 1, bottom 2s become 3 but upper 2s stay 2 while expected keeps them 2).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated fills many internal 0s with 5 (e.g., rows 3-8, cols 9-13) where expected keeps 0; recolors left 2s to nothing (stay 2? but expected 2); changes positions (3,3)-(3,4) to 5 where expected 0; (9,3)-(10,4) to 3 where expected 1; overfills right column with 5s correctly in some spots but adds extras.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated keeps some 4/6/7 as-is or recolors wrongly (e.g., row 5 col 1-3 as 5,5,5 where expected 4,6,6; row 13 col 12-13 as 3,3 where expected 7,7); flood fill adds 5s in wrong places like row 0 col 6; bottom 3s wrong (expected 7,7).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated recolors some 6s to nothing or wrong (e.g., row 6 col 14 as 5 where expected 6; row 12 col 16 as 5 where expected 6); keeps most but flood-fills extras like row 4 col 2 as 5 (expected 5? wait similar); row 16 col 3 as 6 where expected 6 but context wrong; special 2s at bottom stay 2 correctly but some 5s overplaced.
 * Recoloring condition "if left_vis or (top_vis and (w > 2 or not right_vis or min_i == 0))" is too permissive, leading to over-recoloring odds to 3 and evens to 5; doesn't handle color 1 (stays?), 6,7,9 properly—e.g., 1 often stays 1 if visible.
 * Flood fill with seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and fill to 5 is unhelpful/broken: overfills connected 0s in all trains (e.g., Train 1 fills object interiors that should stay 0; Train 2 fills unrelated areas); perhaps seeds should be edge-visible only, or no fill at all, or fill to background/different color.
 * extract_components is helpful and correct for grouping; visibility functions are mostly correct but right_vis check is per-cell from right, which may not align with full component visibility.
 * Special rule for 2 only when bg=8 and bottom-touch is partially helpful but too narrow—Train 3 (bg=7) keeps 2s as 2 without change, suggesting 2 often unchanged unless specific.
 * Used set collection is good but skips b and 0 correctly; however, processing order (for c in used, skipping 2) causes issues if 2 interacts with visibility for others.
 * No handling for color 4/6/9 specifics; e.g., in Train 2, 4s seem to stay or become visible without recolor in some paths.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It recolors long horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 to 3 (likely odd color visible from top/left), but keeps many 3s as 3 throughout without change, suggesting the original grid has many 3s that stay; however, 1s stay 1, 5s appear in some clusters (e.g., row 8 col 6-8), 9s in bottom-right, but flood fill seems absent (no 5s filling 0s, assuming originals have 0s—output shows no 0s visible, but likely over-recolored or filled wrongly).
 * Compared to patterns in trains, it under-fills: Expected likely retains internal 0s (like Train 1's object holes) but this seems to have recolored components like vertical 3s on left to 3, scattered 1s stay, but 5s/9s placed without clear visibility (e.g., row 12 col 13-15 as 9s may be even color visible from right?); no massive 5-fills, which is better than trains but still mismatches if 0s should remain.
 * Subtleties missed: Test has large grid (30 cols?), complex nested components (e.g., 1s inside 3s/5s); output treats 3s as visible (stay/change?), but if core rule is to highlight visible fronts (3 left/top, 5 right/bottom?), this partially does but ignores depths/occlusions fully.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (components extracted, some recolored by visibility) but likely wrong in not filling 0s selectively and over-retaining originals like 3s/1s without occlusion checks; e.g., bottom 9s may be back-facing (should be 5?), and no special for 2 (none present).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to classify and recolor connected components (blobs) of specific colors based on rules like visibility from edges (top, left, right), size, position (e.g., near bottom or top rows), and background color, then flood-filling empty spaces (0's) with 5's starting from seed colors like 1,3,5,7,9 using 8-connectivity. The goal is to produce a modified grid where certain blobs are changed to 3 (green-like) or 5 (orange-like or fill), while preserving others, and ensuring the fill propagates correctly without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is determined from g[0][0] and excludes certain colors from processing (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} - {bg}).
 * Components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals), which is crucial for blob shapes but can merge unexpectedly if not handled.
 * Visibility rules: Top-visible if any cell in component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; left-visible if no blockers left in row; right-visible similarly but checking right side (note: right-visible check in code looks for blockers to the right, but logic may invert intent).
 * Size and position filters: For green (1,7,9), skip if >4 cells; use bounding box height/width (h,w) where w > h or (h==w and top position <=2 and not right-visible) triggers change to 3. For orange (4,6), skip if >6 cells or min row >3; change to 5 if top- or left-visible.
 * Special case for bg==8: Change bottom-touching 2-components to 3, but only if they touch near bottom (i >= n-5, which is arbitrary and may miss subtle bottom definitions).
 * Flood fill starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and spreads to adjacent 0's with 5, using 8-connectivity and visited to avoid revisits, but seeds themselves are not changed (only propagate from them).
 * Empty cells (0's) remain 0 unless filled; non-seed colors like 2,4,6 may stay or change based on rules.
 * Subtle: Flood fill uses directions including diagonals, but only fills 0's; it marks visited but sets to 5 immediately, which could block further spread if not careful. Also, components of size 1-4 for green or <=6 for orange with visibility/position are targeted, but over-application can change non-target blobs.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, 30x29?), so n,m dynamic; bottom-touching defined loosely (e.g., last 5 rows).
 * Potential misses: Right-visibility may be overused or inverted; flood fill seeds include changed colors (3,5), so order matters (changes before fill). No handling for vertical/horizontal dominance beyond w>h. Components must be fully connected; isolated cells count as components.

(Flood fills 0's from seeds using BFS with 8-connectivity; works but seeds propagate immediately from neighbors, which is correct if seeds are unchanged.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated incorrectly changed left-side 2-blob cells (rows 3-7, cols 2-3) to 5 instead of leaving as 0/2, over-applied orange rules or flood; bottom 2's (rows 14-15, cols 10-11) correctly to 3, but some 5's in cols 14-16 overfilled where expected 0's; right 1's stayed 1 (correct), but flood missed some 0's turning to 5.
 * In training example 1, special bg=8 rule for bottom 2's worked partially (changed to 3), but green/orange rules over-applied to non-visible or large components, e.g., vertical structure in cols 9-10 got 5's where expected 0's.
 * In training example 2 (bg=9), generated kept some 5's and 3's correctly top-left but failed on right-side 6's (row2 col11-12 as 5 instead of 6, row3 col13 as 5? Wait, expected has 6,6,4 so under-changed); orange 4/6 blobs in rows5-6 cols1-3 stayed 4/6 (correct) but flood over-applied 5's in row1 col6? No major flood issue, but component extraction missed splitting or visibility for mid-grid 6's.
 * In training example 2, green 3's top-left correct, but size filter skipped some small components incorrectly; right-bottom 7's stayed 7 (correct, as non-green/orange), but a 5 in row1 col10 incorrect (expected 9? bg).
 * In training example 3 (bg=7), generated under-applied 5's to left 6-blob (rows1-2 cols4-5 as 3? No, as 6, but expected 5's for top parts); over-kept 6's in rows3-9 col2-3 where expected 5's in some; bottom 2's stayed 2 (correct); 1's stayed 1 (correct, perhaps non-target).
 * In training example 3, touches_bottom not triggered correctly for some, and visibility (top/left) missed for horizontal dominance; flood fill under-applied, leaving some 0's? But outputs show no 0's visible, differences in 3 vs 5 for 6-blobs.
 * extract_components is helpful and seems correct (8-connectivity matches blob shapes in diffs).
 * has_top_visible, has_left_visible, has_right_visible are essential but right_visible logic checks for no blockers to right (meaning visible from right edge?), which may be inverted—generated often fails when right-visible should block change.
 * flood_fill_from_seeds works for propagation but starts only from seeds' neighbors, not overwriting seeds; in trains, it overfills some 0's to 5 where expected 0 (e.g., train1 left structure).
 * Special bg==8 rule partially worked (bottom 2 to 3) but applied too broadly; general green/orange rules too aggressive on size/position (e.g., min_i <=3 too loose, len>4 skip misses small visible).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but touches_bottom with fixed -5 is heuristic and not general (breaks for varying grid heights).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (30x29? grid, bg=4) has many 5's already placed (e.g., row8 cols6-8 as 5,5,5; row19-21 cols21-23 as 5's), suggesting pre-flood changes, but looks over-filled—e.g., scattered 5's in row8 col6-8 may be from orange rule on 5? Input has 5's? Wait, the "generated output" includes original colors like 9's,1's,4's unchanged in places, with some 5's added (e.g., row8), but no visible 0's left, implying flood filled everything adjacent to seeds.
 * Test output does not look fully correct: It preserves large 1-blobs (e.g., rows3-4 cols5-12 as 1's, expected perhaps change to 3 if small/visible green), but adds 5's in isolated spots like row8 cols6-8 (possibly erroneous flood from nearby 5? Input has 5 there? No, input not given, but output has them as 5 while surrounding 1's/4's); bottom rows have 5's in row19-21 cols21-23, which may be correct fill but over-spreads to row22 col21 as 1? Wait, row22 has 1's.
 * Test output misses potential 3-changes for top 9/1 blobs (rows2-3 cols2-5,14-21 as 9/1, visible from top/left but stayed, violating green rule if size<=4); flood seems to have filled some but left paths open incorrectly (e.g., row12 col24-26 as 9's, possibly unfilled 0's? But output shows no 0's, all filled or colored).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (fills from seeds like 1,5,9 to 5 in empties), but incorrect due to unchanged green-like blobs (1,9) that should be 3 if visible/small, and possible over-change of 4's to 5 without position check; looks like rules applied but visibility/size thresholds wrong, leading to under-classification.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid (numbers represent colors) to identify connected components of specific "object" colors, evaluate them based on visibility from edges (top/left/right), size, shape (width vs height), and position (e.g., touching bottom), then change qualifying components to new colors like 3 (for green-like objects) or 5 (for orange-like objects), while leaving non-qualifying areas as 0 (empty) or background. Finally, perform a limited flood-fill from certain seeds (1,3,5) to propagate 5 into adjacent 0s, but only in ways that simulate "shadows" or fills without over-spreading to block visibility rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; exclude it from object colors (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} minus {bg}; similar for orange {4,6}).
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals: up/down/left/right + diagonals), extracted via BFS/DFS flood-fill on exact color matches, ignoring bg and 0.
 * For green-like (1,7,9 except bg): Only small components (size <=4); must be top-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 above it in column); shape prefers wide (w > h) or left-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 to left in row) or single-cell square at top without right visibility; change to 3 if qualified.
 * For orange-like (4,6 except bg): Slightly larger (size <=6); must have top-visible or left-visible; same shape preference as green; change to 5.
 * Special case: If bg==8, change bottom-touching (max row >= n-4? but this threshold seems arbitrary/wrong) components of 2 to 3.
 * Flood-fill: Only from seeds {1,3,5}, but propagate ONLY to adjacent 0s (8 directions), setting them to 5; however, this must be constrained to avoid filling areas that should remain 0 (e.g., "open" spaces or behind objects); current implementation over-fills indiscriminately, ignoring visibility or object blocking.
 * 0s are empty space; non-qualifying components stay as original color or become 0? But in examples, some original colors persist (e.g., 1s,2s,6s), while others are cleared to 0 or changed.
 * Subtle: Visibility checks treat bg and 0 as "transparent" (don't block), but any other color blocks; right-visible checks from right edge inward, but rarely used.
 * Shape "ok" logic is convoluted: Allows squares only if single cell and top-row or not right-visible; this may miss vertical stacks.
 * Bottom-touching for special 2: Threshold n-4 seems too loose (e.g., touches near-bottom rows); likely should be stricter (e.g., row >=n-2).
 * Flood-fill starts from seeds but immediately sets neighbors to 5 and queues them, leading to full spread; probably needs to be directional (e.g., downward/rightward only) or blocked by objects.
 * Grids vary in size; n=rows, m=cols; assume rectangular.
 * Expected outputs preserve some original colors (e.g., 1s as seeds, 2s unchanged unless special, 6s as blockers) and leave strategic 0s unfilled (e.g., holes or paths).
 * Easy to miss: Components must be fully connected; isolated pixels count as size=1; over-aggressive size limits skip valid multi-part objects; flood-fill visits 0s but shouldn't cross object boundaries or fill top/left visible areas.

These functions are helpful for component extraction (8-connected BFS), bbox/size calc, and visibility checks (treating 0/bg as transparent). They correctly identify isolated groups but need integration with stricter rules.

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
```python
def flood_fill_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Over-fills all adjacent 0s from {1,3,5} without directionality or blocking, setting to 5 indiscriminately.
    # It queues and spreads fully, but examples show selective filling (e.g., only "shadow" areas, leaving holes as 0).
    # Not helpful as-is; needs constraints like downward-only from objects or avoiding top/left visible paths.
    # Don't use without major fixes.
```
```python
def change_special_two_components(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Only triggers if bg==8, changes bottom-touching 2s to 3, but threshold n-4 is arbitrary/wrong (e.g., Train1 expected keeps some 2s).
    # Also, in Train3 (bg=7), 2s are kept as-is in expected, but logic doesn't apply. Unhelpful without generalizing or fixing threshold.
```
The change_green/orange functions are partially helpful but have wrong size/shape thresholds (e.g., skip valid >4/6? No, but misapply visibility/shape_ok, leading to wrong changes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly extracts 8-connected components and checks visibility/bg exclusion, but fails all training due to over-changing (e.g., turns non-qualifying greens/oranges to 3/5 instead of 0) and buggy flood-fill.
 * Train1 (bg=8): Generated fills too many 0s with 5 (e.g., row3 col9=5 vs exp=0; row6 col2=5 vs exp=0), changes some 1s/5s incorrectly (but 1s should be seeds?); keeps 2s but exp clears some areas to 0 without filling; special 2 logic misfires (bottom 2s changed to 3? but exp keeps 2s); shape_ok allows wrong vertical stacks as 5.
 * Train2 (bg=9): Generated changes top 7s to nothing (stay 7? but exp=3), turns some 4s to 5 correctly but misses others (e.g., row1 col10=4->? exp=5, but row2 col11-12=6 stay 6 ok); over-applies 3 to wrong 3/7 spots (e.g., row1 col3-4=3 ok, but row2 col7-8=7 vs exp=3); flood-fill absent or weak, leaving no extra 5s where exp has them (e.g., row1 col10=5).
 * Train3 (bg=7): Generated changes some 6s/1s to 3 incorrectly (e.g., row1-2 col4-5=3 ok, but row4 col2=6->? exp=5; row8 col1-2=6->? gen keeps 6 vs exp=5); misses turning vertical 6s/1s to 5 (e.g., left column 6s stay 6, but exp=5 for some); special 2 not applied (correct, but bottom 2s stay 2 ok); no flood-fill evident, as exp has 5s in empty spots but gen lacks them.
 * Overall: Visibility checks work (top/left detect edges), but shape_ok too permissive (allows non-wide as 5/3 wrongly); size limits too strict/loose; flood-fill spreads everywhere, filling "visible" 0s that should stay 0 (e.g., holes behind objects); doesn't clear non-qualifying objects to 0 (keeps originals like 5/1 where exp=0).
 * extract_components is essential and correct for grouping; get_bbox_and_size useful for h/w; visibility funcs good but has_right_visible underused/misapplied in shape_ok.
 * change_green/orange apply changes but wrong conditions (e.g., Train1 changes isolated 5s? to 5 redundantly); don't handle 1 as seed (keep as-is?).
 * Missed: Selective 0-to-5 only in "shadows" (e.g., below/right of objects, not above/left); components of same color but disconnected treated separately (ok, but aggregate? No).
 * Unknown: Why Train1 exp has 0s in a "stem" under 2s (not filled), but gen fills to 5; possibly flood only from changed 3/5, not original 1/5.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows scattered 5s (e.g., row8-10 has 5s in middle, likely from orange change) and some flood-fill (e.g., row5 col22-23=1? Wait, output has 1s persisting, but flood from them?); however, large areas of 0-implied (not shown, but gen has 4 bg everywhere else) suggest under-filling, while visible 1s/9s aren't cleared/changed properly (e.g., top 1s should be green? but bg=4, 1 is green, top-visible, size? If small/wide, to 3, then flood below to 5, but gen keeps 1s and adds random 5s). It over-relies on existing 5s for flood (row8 col6-8=5, probably wrong change of ? color), missing expected 0s in paths/holes (e.g., row12 col7-8=1s stay, but exp likely 0 or 5 shadow). Doesn't account for large grid (30 cols?); components like horizontal 1s (row3 col5-12) should be wide green to 3, flooding below, but gen keeps 1s. Looks like partial visibility detection but no clearing to 0, leading to messy unchanged areas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 2D list of integers representing colored cells (with 0 as empty, a background color b, and various foreground colors), and the goal is to produce an output grid by recoloring connected components of foreground colors to 3 or 5 based on rules involving their color parity, position (e.g., near the top), visibility from top or left edges (unobstructed by other non-background non-empty cells), and special cases (e.g., for specific color-background pairs or bottom-touching), followed by flood-filling remaining empty (0) cells connected to "seed" colors {1,3,5} with color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must consider all 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells correctly.
 * Background b is always the top-left cell value; ignore it and 0s when collecting used colors or checking obstructions.
 * For odd foreground colors (c % 2 == 1, excluding b and special case c=1 when b=8): recolor entire component to 3 only if it's near the top (min row index <=3) AND fully top-visible (at least one cell in the component has no non-b non-0 cells above it in its column).
 * For even foreground colors (c % 2 == 0, excluding b, c=2, and special case c=6 when b=9): recolor entire component to 5 only if near the top (min row <=3) AND (top-visible OR left-visible, where left-visible means at least one cell has no non-b non-0 cells to its left in its row).
 * Special case for c=2 when b=8: recolor to 3 if the component touches near the bottom (max row >= n-3), regardless of other rules.
 * Flood-fill only affects 0s: start from all cells already colored 1,3, or 5 (seeds), and fill adjacent (8 directions) 0s with 5, propagating to connected empties—but do not overwrite existing non-0 cells, and ensure it's a proper BFS flood to handle disconnected empty regions (only those touching seeds get filled).
 * Subtlety: Visibility checks must scan strictly above/left in the column/row, stopping at any obstructing cell (non-b and >0); if any cell in component is visible, the whole component qualifies.
 * Easy to miss: Rules are applied in sequence (special first, then odds to 3, then evens to 5), but components are extracted from the original input grid, not the modified output, to avoid interference; also, used colors exclude b and 0.
 * Flood-fill must not fill isolated 0s not connected to seeds; in some cases, 0s remain if not reachable.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18 for train1, 15x15 for train2, larger for test); rules like row thresholds (<=3 or >=n-3) are relative but fixed (top=3 rows, bottom=last 3 rows?).
 * No recoloring for certain pairs (e.g., skip c=1 if b=8 for odd rule; skip c=6 if b=9 for even rule), suggesting puzzle-specific exceptions to avoid over-recoloring.
 * Output keeps background and unchanged cells as-is, only modifies qualifying components and connected 0s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, used colors, and 8-connected components; extract_components is essential and works well for grouping.
 * Odd color rule partially works: in train3 (correct), it likely applied top-visible + near-top to color odds to 3 appropriately.
 * Even color rule has issues: in train1, it colored some evens to 5 where expected keeps 0s or originals (e.g., generated row3 col16=5 but expected 0; row4 col13=5 but expected 0), suggesting over-application or wrong visibility check.
 * Special c=2 b=8 rule works in train1: bottom 2's correctly to 3 (e.g., row14 col10-11=3 in both), but interacts badly with flood-fill, leading to extra 5's nearby.
 * In train2 (b=9), even rule skipped c=6 correctly (no recolor), but mismatches like row2 col13=5 generated vs 4 expected (possibly a 6 or 4 component miscolored; unknown why, as input not shown but output differs); also row3 col13=5 vs 4, row4 col14=5 vs 9? Wait, expected row4 col14=9? No, expected row3 col13=6? Wait, details fuzzy but clear recoloring error for evens/4/6.
 * Flood-fill is helpful but buggy: in train1, it over-fills 0s to 5 in areas not intended (e.g., row3 col14=5 vs expected 0; row5 col2=5 vs 0; row6 col2=0 expected but generated 5? Wait, generated row5 col2=5 vs expected 0), possibly because seeds include post-recolor 3/5, but queue init only fills direct adjacents initially, then propagates—yet misses some isolations or overreaches due to 8-dir.
 * touches_bottom is useful for special bottom rule but threshold n-3 may be too loose (touches last 3 rows?); works for train1 bottom.
 * Visibility functions are core but subtle bug: they return True if ANY cell in component is visible, which is correct per rules, but in train1, this may cause over-coloring if partial visibility triggers whole comp.
 * Overall, sequence of applying rules (special -> odds -> evens) is good, but exceptions like skipping c=1 b=8 and c=6 b=9 are incomplete—train2 fails suggest more specials needed (e.g., for 4?).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though flood_fill needs fix for proper seed-adjacency without overfill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (on a ~30x30 grid with b=4, colors including 1,3,5,9) applies rules but over-fills with 5's extensively, e.g., large areas of original 3's and 1's remain but many 0's (implied in input) are 5, and some 9's stay—however, it does not look fully correct because odd colors like 1 and 3 should be checked for top-visibility and near-top to become 3, but generated keeps many 1's/3's unchanged (e.g., rows 2-3 full 3's stay 3, which might be correct if not visible, but row5 col6-7=4 stay? Wait, input has 4's as b); even 5's already present stay, but 9 (odd) in bottom areas like row5 col21-23=9 stay 9, possibly not near-top so no recolor—yet flood seems to have filled some but left others (e.g., row8 col20=1 stay, but adjacent 0's? to 5).
 * Mismatches likely: if input has near-top 1's (odd) with top-visible, they should become 3 but stay 1 in generated (e.g., row5 col2-3=1 stay); 9's (odd) near bottom stay 9 correctly (not near-top), but if any top-visible 9 near top, should be 3—generated doesn't change them, suggesting rule application missed some components.
 * Flood-fill appears to have worked partially (many 5's in empty areas connected to seeds like existing 5's in row8 col6-8), but if there are isolated 0's not touching 1/3/5 post-recolor, they should remain 0—generated seems to fill too much, similar to train1 overfill issue.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (respects b=4, doesn't touch bottom specials since no 2, keeps non-qualifying components), but likely incorrect due to under-recoloring odds (e.g., visible 1's/9's not to 3) and potential flood overreach; without expected, hard to confirm, but pattern suggests rules need tuning for larger grids or more color interactions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images of plant-like structures (e.g., trees or foliage) where the goal is to transform an input grid by recoloring components (connected groups of cells) based on positional rules, visibility from edges, and adjacency to "seeds" (certain colors like 1,3,5), ultimately filling empty spaces (0s) connected to valid structures. The background color (b) influences specific rules, such as treating certain colors as potential leaves (3) or stems (5), while ignoring or skipping others like 2 unless special conditions apply.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-way connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells correctly; 4-way would miss diagonal connections.
 * Background (b) is the color at [0][0] and is ignored in visibility checks; empty cells (0) are not background but potential fillable space.
 * Visibility from top: A component has top visibility if at least one of its cells has no non-background/non-empty cells above it in the same column.
 * Visibility from left: Similar, no non-background/non-empty cells to the left in the same row.
 * For odd colors (1,3,5,7,9 excluding b): Change to 3 (likely "leaves") if min row <=2 (top-positioned), top-visible, and either left-visible or at row 0; stricter for color 1 (requires both visibilities).
 * Stem colors depend on b: empty for b=4/8, 4 for b=9, 6 for b=7; these change to 5 (likely "stems") if min row <=4, top-visible, and not touching right edge.
 * Special rule for b=8 and color 2: Change entire component to 3 if it touches the bottom (max row >= n-3, suggesting near-bottom but not exact edge; this may be off by 1-2 rows).
 * Second pass: Remaining stem-colored components (after first pass) change to 5 if any cell is adjacent (8-way) to a seed {1,3,5}.
 * Final flood fill: All 0s connected (8-way) to any seed {1,3,5} become 5; this must start from 0s adjacent to seeds and propagate, but only after prior changes.
 * Subtleties: min_row checks are strict (e.g., >4 skips entirely); right-touch is any cell on rightmost column; flood fill uses visited to avoid revisiting but starts incorrectly (sets to 5 before queuing, but checks adjacency first); no handling for color 2 in general cases; odds like 7/9 may need looser left-vis rules; bottom-touch for 2s may need adjustment (e.g., >=n-2 or component spanning); adjacency for stems is per-cell but triggers whole component; 0s not connected to seeds stay 0 (important for open spaces); b=4/7/8/9 have varying stem_cs, but code misses some (e.g., no stem for b=4); components extracted on original g first, then out for second pass, but flood on final out.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill queue starts only from adjacent 0s, but code has a bug—initial loop sets out[i][j]=5 and queues if adjacent, but visited is set, ok; however, it doesn't flood non-adjacent 0s correctly if chain; no reversal of changes; color 6 in train3 expected but not generated, suggesting missing stem handling or propagation for b=7; in train1, bottom 2s partially changed but not all in component; extra 5s in places that should be 0 (e.g., isolated or non-qualifying areas).

The flood fill in the main program is helpful but buggy in initialization (sets to 5 before full queuing; works but inefficient); uses deque for BFS.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies background b and skips it/0s in color sets and visibility.
 * Correctly uses 8-way connectivity for components, which is essential for blob shapes like the 2s in train1 or 6s in train3.
 * First pass changes some top-left odds to 3 correctly in parts (e.g., train1 top 1s stay but should propagate; train2 top 3s stay 3).
 * Special rule for b=8 color 2 partially works: changes some bottom 2s to 3 (e.g., train1 row14 3,3) but misses others in same component (row13 2,2 stay 2 instead of expected 3,3; likely touches_bottom threshold wrong, as max i=14 < n-3=15 for n=18).
 * Stem handling for b=7/9 adds stem_cs={6}/{4} and changes some to 5 if top-vis/not right-touch, but misses propagation (train3 generates no 6s to 5 in places like row5 col12=6 expected, instead 5 elsewhere; train2 row3 col5=5 generated but expected 4, suggesting over-change).
 * Second pass adj to seeds changes some stems to 5 (helpful for propagation), but skips if not qualifying in first pass.
 * Flood fill correctly spreads 5 to connected 0s adj to {1,3,5} (8-way), but overfills in train1 (e.g., row3 col14=5 generated vs 0 expected; row6 col2=5 gen vs 0 exp; isolated 0s filled wrongly) and train2 (row4 col5=9 gen? Wait no, but mismatches like row3 col5=5 vs4).
 * Train1 mismatches: Extra 5s in right column (e.g., row3 col14=5 vs0, row3 col16=5 ok but row4 col13=5 vs0, row5 col2=5 vs0); bottom 2s not fully to 3 (row13 col11-12=2,2 vs3,3); flood overfills vertical 0s on right that aren't connected to valid seeds.
 * Train2 mismatches: Overchanges potential stems (row3 col5=5 vs4, row4 col6=5 vs4? Expected row4 [9,9,9,5,9,9,4,...] gen [9,9,9,5,9,9,5,...] so col6=5 vs4); bottom 3s in row13 col10-11=3,3 gen? But expected row13 [9,9,4,4,4,7,7,9,9,7,7,9,7,7,9] no 3s there, wait gen has issues elsewhere like row5 col1=4 ok but overall wrong placements for 4/6.
 * Train3 mismatches: No 6s generated at all (expected 6s in row5 col12, row6 col11-12/14, row7 col14, etc., as stems); instead over-relies on 5s (e.g., row5 col12=2? Wait gen row5 [7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,2,2,7,...] vs exp [7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,2,2,...] so col12=5 vs6, and misses later 6s like row10 col10=6 exp vs5 gen); bottom 2s stay 2 ok, but no stem propagation to 6 then 5.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for identifying blobs.
 * has_top_visible and has_left_visible are helpful and seem accurate for edge visibility.
 * touches_bottom is helpful but likely broken (threshold n-3 too strict; in train1 n=18, max i=14 for 2s should trigger but doesn't fully).
 * get_adjacent_seed is helpful for second pass and flood init.
 * Overall, first pass min_row/top-vis rules partially work for leaves (3) but too strict/loose for stems; no handling for color 6/4 as intermediates in b=7/9; flood overfills non-connected 0s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies changes similar to training failures (e.g., many isolated 1s stay 1 but should perhaps propagate to 3/5 if qualifying; 3s at top-left stay 3 ok, but 9s in middle-right seem unchanged or partially to 5 wrongly, like row5 col21-23=9,9,9 gen vs likely need stem/leaf rules for b=4; flood to 5 in row8 col6-8=5,5,5 ok if adj to seeds, but row12 col13-15=9,9,9 stay vs possibly change; bottom row20-22 5,5,5 in col21-23 likely overfill if not connected; extra 5s in row8 col6-8 where input has ? but gen has them without clear seed adj; many 0s absent, replaced by 4s or 5s incorrectly, e.g., potential open spaces filled; for b=4 (no stem_cs), it skips stems but still changes odds to 3/5 wrongly (e.g., top 3s to ? stay, but 1s propagate poorly); looks like leaf changes partial but flood over-aggressive, missing that some 9s/1s are separate components not visible/adj. Make sure to account for b=4 having no stems (empty stem_cs correct, but odds overchanged) and larger grid needing efficient component extraction to handle 30x30 without missing large blobs like the right-side 1s/9s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs/objects) of specific colors in a background grid, evaluate their visibility from edges (top, left, right, bottom), and transform them to new colors (e.g., 3 or 5) based on shape ratios (width vs height), visibility conditions, and background-specific rules, before performing a flood fill from certain seed values (odd numbers like 1,3,5,7,9) to fill empty (0) spaces with 5, likely simulating some kind of object occlusion or rendering in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals) groups of the same non-background, non-zero value; empty spaces are 0.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0]; exclude bg from consideration for changes, and visibility checks ignore bg and 0.
 * For "green" colors (1,7,9 if not bg): Change to 3 if top-visible and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)).
 * For "orange" colors (4,6 if not bg): Change to 5 if (top or left visible) and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)); subtle: this seems to target horizontal-ish bars or protrusions.
 * Special case if bg==8: Change 2-components to 3 if bottom-visible (perhaps shadows or ground-level objects).
 * Flood fill: Starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9}, spreads to adjacent 0s (8 directions) filling with 5, but only if not visited; subtle: this might simulate filling hidden/empty areas behind visible objects, but it can overfill if seeds are misplaced.
 * Visibility: A component is "top-visible" if any cell has no non-bg/non-0 above it in the same column; similar for left (same row left), right (same row right), bottom (below).
 * Subtleties: Changes use a dict to avoid overwriting; components must be non-empty; shape ratio uses bounding box (min/max i/j +1 for h/w); easy to miss: visibility is per-cell then any in component, and changes only if do_change condition met; flood fill uses BFS but seeds include post-change values, so order matters (changes before fill); bg can be colors like 4,8,9 affecting which are "greens/oranges"; no diagonal-only connections—full 8-way; potential over-changing if multiple rules overlap; empty grid areas stay bg unless filled.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle variable grid sizes; ensure copy_grid preserves original; visited prevents re-flood; but flood seeds include 5 which might self-propagate if adjacent to 0; rules seem asymmetric (favor horizontal changes, right/bottom less prioritized); test inputs may have no 0s initially, so fill only creates if changes introduce them? No—changes replace to 3/5, fill only targets existing 0s; subtle miss: expected outputs have 0s where generated has 5/3, suggesting changes should introduce 0s or not fill certain areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) passed Training example 3 (correct output matched), showing core component extraction, visibility, and flood fill work in some cases.
 * Failed Training 1: Generated filled areas with 5 and changed to 3 where expected has 0s and 2/5; specifically, upper blob (likely 2?) changed incorrectly to 3/5 instead of keeping/changing to 2 with 0s for hidden parts; flood fill over-applied 5 to what should be 0s; bottom 3s correct, but side 1s unchanged correctly; unknown why 2 not handled as special (bg=8 rule applied but wrong visibility?).
 * Failed Training 2: Generated kept some 5/3 but misplaced 4/6 vs expected (e.g., row 5 col 1-2: generated 5,5 expected 4,6; row 12 col 5: generated 4 expected 4 but surrounding mismatches); changes to 5/3 over-applied to vertical-ish components; flood fill didn't create 0s, but expected has no 0s—issue is wrong color swaps (e.g., 6s became 5?); bg=9, so greens=1,7 but input has 3,5,6,4,7—3 not changed, but oranges=4,6 changed wrong.
 * extract_components is essential and correct (used successfully in the correct example 3).
 * Visibility functions are helpful but subtle bug: they check per-cell but return if ANY visible, which is correct, but in train1, top_vis likely true but do_change wrong for vertical blobs.
 * Flood fill is mostly helpful but unhelpful in cases with no 0s (does nothing, correct) or overfills post-change seeds; in train1, it filled what should be 0s (perhaps changes didn't introduce 0s, but expected has them—suggests rule should set some to 0 instead of 3/5).
 * Changes dict avoids overlaps, helpful; greens/oranges filtering by !=bg is key but missed if bg in list (e.g., train2 bg=9 not in lists).
 * Overall: Partial rules for horizontal changes work (why example 3 passed), but vertical/square components not distinguished well; special bg=8 rule applied in train1 but wrong (changed 2 to 3, but expected kept 2 with 0s); no handling for keeping 0s or other colors like 2/5 unchanged.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have minimally changed the input (kept most 1,3,5,9 components as-is or swapped some 1/9 to 3 under rules), with no 0s introduced and flood fill doing nothing (since no 0s in input and changes don't create them), resulting in a grid full of 4(bg),1,3,5,9 without occlusions or empties.
 * Expected likely includes 0s in hidden areas (e.g., behind vertical 1s or 9s, similar to train1 where 0s represent occluded space), and possibly more changes to 5 for oranges (but bg=4, so oranges=6 only if present—input has none?); e.g., the large horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 stayed 3 (correct if not green), but vertical 9s in col 21-23 rows 5-20 probably should be partially 0 or changed if not top-visible; side 5s in row8 col6-8 stayed, but if left-visible and wide, should be 5? Wait, already 5; overall, lacks 0s where components overlap shadows, and flood fill missed because no seeds hit 0s—suggests rules need to set some component parts to 0 for depth/occlusion, not just color swap; unknown exact diffs without input grid, but output looks too "filled" vs expected sparse 0s in trains.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:11:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to process a colored grid by identifying connected components (blobs) of non-background, non-empty cells, applying color changes based on visibility from the top or left edges and parity rules, handling special cases for certain colors and positions (e.g., bottom-placed 2's when background is 8), and then selectively filling adjacent empty (0) cells as "stems" without overfilling entire connected regions of 0's. The output transforms the input grid according to these rules to reveal a structured pattern, likely representing objects with stems or supports that don't fully flood empty spaces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always g[0][0]; ignore it and 0's when identifying used colors or components.
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), extracted via BFS/DFS flood-fill; empty components should be skipped.
 * Visibility checks: Top-visible if at least one cell in the component has only background or 0's above it in the same column (no blocking non-bg/0 cells). Left-visible if at least one cell has only background or 0's to the left in the same row.
 * Color change rules: Process used colors in sorted order, skipping 2 always and 1 if background==8. For odd colors (e.g., 1,3): change entire component to 3 if top-visible. For even colors (e.g., 4,6): change to 5 if left-visible or (top-visible AND all cells in the same row). Do not change background or skipped colors.
 * Special case: If background==8, identify components of 2; if any cell's row >= n-4 (near bottom), change the whole component to 3 (overrides other rules? applied after main changes).
 * Stem filling: Only fill 0's that are directly below or adjacent to changed components (e.g., 1,3,5) in a stem-like manner (vertical lines downward), but do NOT flood-fill entire connected 0 regions—leave long vertical 0's as empty unless they terminate in a specific way (e.g., connect to bottom or other objects). Seeds for filling are 1,3,5, but propagation should be limited (e.g., only downward or adjacent without full BFS).
 * Subtleties: Same-row check for even colors uses set of rows in component ==1. Changes happen in-place on a copy of the grid. Order matters: change visible components first, then special bottom 2's, then fill stems. Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, test 30x?); ensure bounds checking. 0's are empty space, not part of components. In examples, stems often remain 0's for height, with 5's only at bases or connections—overfilling breaks this.
 * Potential misses: Diagonals in connectivity can merge unexpected components; visibility ignores 0's as non-blocking. Special rule only for 2's near bottom when bg=8—may not apply elsewhere. Filling must simulate "drawing" stems downward without sideways or full propagation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import collections

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Correctly duplicates grid without mutation.)

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(Accurately identifies bg color.)

```python
def get_used_colors(g: List[List[int]], b: int) -> set[int]:
    s: set[int] = set()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != b and cell != 0:
                s.add(cell)
    return s
```
(Helpful for filtering relevant colors, excluding bg and empties.)

```python
directions8 = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if (di, dj) != (0, 0)]

def extract_components(g: List[List[int]], target: int) -> List[List[tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    comps = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] == target:
                comp = []
                q = collections.deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                comp.append((i, j))
                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions8:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == target:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))
                            comp.append((nx, ny))
                comps.append(comp)
    return comps
```
(Essential for finding 8-connected components of a specific color; used correctly for processing.)

```python
def has_top_visible(comp: List[tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], b: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    for i, j in comp:
        vis = True
        for k in range(i):
            if g[k][j] != b and g[k][j] != 0:
                vis = False
                break
        if vis:
            return True
    return False
```
(Helpful for top visibility check; correctly identifies if a column above a cell is clear.)

```python
def has_left_visible(comp: List[tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], b: int) -> bool:
    m = len(g[0])
    for i, j in comp:
        vis = True
        for l in range(j):
            if g[i][l] != b and g[i][l] != 0:
                vis = False
                break
        if vis:
            return True
    return False
```
(Helpful for left visibility check; correctly identifies if a row left of a cell is clear.)

```python
def special_bottom_two(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    b = get_background(g)
    if b != 8:
        return g
    n = len(g)
    comps = extract_components(g, 2)
    for comp in comps:
        if comp and max(i for i, _ in comp) >= n - 4:
            for i, j in comp:
                g[i][j] = 3
    return g
```
(Partially helpful for the specific bg=8 bottom-2 rule; correctly changes qualifying 2's to 3's, but applied after main changes—may need reordering if 2's are altered earlier.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating incomplete understanding of rules, especially stem filling.
 * Train 1: Bottom 2's correctly changed to 3's via special_bottom_two (matches expected in rows 13-15, cols 10-11). 1's correctly skipped/not changed (remain 1's in rows 1-2 and 9-10). 2's on left (rows 3-4, cols 2-3) correctly skipped/unchanged. However, main change_visible_components over-applied 5's to some even components (e.g., generated 5's in row 3 col 9, row 5-7 cols 2/4/9/13, where expected has 0's or unchanged). fill_stems massively overfilled vertical/horizontal 0's with 5's (e.g., entire columns 9,13,16 filled with 5's from rows 3-11, but expected keeps long 0's in those stems, with 5's only at specific bottoms like row 3 col 16=5, row 11 col 15=5; unknown why partial but not full fill). Result: Generated has dense 5's grids, expected has sparse 0-stem structures.
 * Train 2: Background 9. Some even colors (e.g., 6's) partially changed to 5's correctly (e.g., rows 1-2 cols 11-12 remain 6's, but expected has 5's there—wait, mismatch: generated has 6's, expected 5's, so under-changed). 4's over-changed to 5's in places (e.g., row 0 col 9=4 in generated but expected 5; row 5 col 1=5 generated but expected 4). 3's (odd) not changed to 3 (already 3, but visibility? top-visible likely, but no action needed). fill_stems overfilled 0's (not shown, but generated has extra 5's like row 0 col 6=5 expected 5 ok, but row 5 col 0=9? Wait, grids differ in empties; overall, generated has misplaced 4/5/6 vs expected's structured 4-stem bases and 5-changes). Result: Mismatches in color swaps (e.g., top 4 to 5 missed) and likely stem overfill (e.g., row 9 col 4=4 generated, expected 4 ok, but row 12 col 12=4 generated, expected 4 ok—subtle diffs in 5/4 positions).
 * Train 3: Background 7. Odd 3's in row 1 cols 2-3 changed? Generated keeps 3's but expected changes to 5's (rows 1-2 cols 4-9=5's, but generated has 6's there—under-changed even 6's). 1's (odd) in rows 7-11 cols 10-11 remain 1's, but expected unchanged ok. 5's already present, skipped. 6's partially changed to 5's (e.g., row 2 cols 10-13=6 generated, expected 5's). 2's at bottom unchanged ok. fill_stems overfilled (e.g., row 1 cols 4-9=5's generated where expected 5's ok, but row 16 cols 3/15=6/1 generated? Diffs in 5/6 placements; generated has extra 5's in row 0? No, but vertical fills wrong, e.g., row 4 col 13=2 generated but expected 2 ok—main issue is missed changes for visible evens/odds). Result: Under-changed visible components (e.g., top row of 6's to 5's missed) and partial stem issues.
 * change_visible_components is mostly helpful but buggy: skips correctly but misapplies even-rule (e.g., same_row check may fail if component spans rows slightly); processes in sorted order ok, but doesn't handle all parities (e.g., 3 odd already 3, no change). special_bottom_two works for train1 but irrelevant for others (bg!=8). fill_stems is broken/not helpful: full BFS flood from any adjacent 0 to seeds 1/3/5 overfills connected empties (e.g., turns stem columns into solid 5's, but expected keeps 0's for height, filling only bases or partial downward). Do not use current fill_stems—replace with downward-only fill from object bottoms. extract_components and visibility functions are essential and correct—keep them. get_used_colors skips bg/0 correctly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-applies 5's similar to training failures, filling dense vertical/horizontal stems (e.g., rows 5-10 cols 6-8=5's from the 5-blob, but likely should be partial 0's downward; rows 12-15 cols 13-15/25-27=9's unchanged but adjacent 0's? Wait, test input has 9's as objects, expected probably changes visible 9's (odd) to 3 if top-vis, but generated keeps many 9's and fills extra 5's around 1's/3's/5's, e.g., row 6 col 22=3 input? Generated has 5's spreading left/right, creating solid bars where expected likely has thin stems (0's) below 1's/3's like in train1). 3's (odd, top-visible in rows 2-4 cols 2-22) should change to 3 (already), but adjacent 0's overfilled with 5's (e.g., row 5 col 5=4 input? Generated fills below). 1's (odd) in scattered positions (e.g., rows 5-12 cols 2-3/10-11) top-visible likely, but if bg=4, no skip, so change to 3? Generated keeps 1's and overfills below with 5's (e.g., row 13 cols 3-4=1's become ? But output shows 1's persisting, stems filled). 9's (odd) in rows 12-22 cols 3-5/13-15/23-25 should change to 3 if top-vis, but generated keeps 9's and fills around. 5's already, no change. Overall, output has too many 5's (overfill) and missed changes for odds/evens (e.g., no 3's from 1's/9's), making it look like a filled-in version rather than structured stems; does not match sparse 0-stem pattern from expected trainings—account for bg=4 (no skip 1), downward-only stem fill from bottoms of 1/3/5, and full visibility changes for odds to 3.

Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where regions of uniform colors represent connected components (blobs) that must be recolored based on structural rules, likely modeling plant-like objects such as leaves (colored 3), stems or branches (colored 5), flowers or centers (possibly 1 or 2), and empty spaces (0), while preserving the background color (b, e.g., 8, 9, 7, 4) and avoiding recoloring irrelevant areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (b) is the dominant color (e.g., 8 in training 1, 9 in training 2, 7 in training 3, 4 in test); never recolor it, and use it to define "non-background" for adjacency checks.
 * Identify 2x2 squares of the same non-b, non-0 color c; recolor them to 3 (green/leaves) only if they have horizontal adjacency to a non-b, non-c cell (subtle: check left/right for each of the 4 cells in the square, but code checks only horizontal, missing vertical/diagonal adjacencies that might be required).
 * Stem color is the first non-b, non-3 color (including 0) that is 4-way adjacent to any 3; then recolor entire connected components (4-way) of that stem color to 5 if the component is in the same row as a 3 OR 8-way adjacent to a 3 (subtle: components must satisfy both conditions in some cases, but code uses OR, leading to over-coloring; also, prioritize "first" stem by iterating used colors + 0).
 * For blue (hardcoded as 1), recolor 0-components (4-way connected) to 5 if attached 4-way to blue AND have at least one upward (north) neighbor that is blue (subtle: "upward attachment" means specifically checking above each cell in the component, not just any attachment).
 * Isolated single 0 cells (size-1 components with no 4-way adjacent non-b) get recolored to 5 (subtle: count adjacencies correctly during flood-fill, but code increments adj_non_b per neighbor, which may overcount if shared).
 * 0 represents empty/fillable space; it can act as a stem or be colored based on attachments, but not all 0s are recolored—only those meeting criteria (subtle: some 0s remain 0 if not isolated or not attached properly, e.g., in training 1 expected has many 0s unchanged).
 * Connected components are 4-way for flooding (up/down/left/right), but 8-way for some attachment checks to 3 (subtle: inconsistency in code's directions usage can miss diagonal touches).
 * Colors like 2,6 may represent petals or other elements; they aren't recolored in this attempt but appear in expectations (e.g., training 1 has 2s unchanged, training 2 has 6s, training 3 has 2s and 6s).
 * Order matters: Color 3s first, then stems to 5, then blue-attached 0s to 5, then isolated 0s to 5 (subtle: later steps may overwrite earlier ones if not careful, e.g., a 0 stem colored to 5 could conflict).
 * Grids vary in size (18x18 for training 1/3, 15x15 for 2, 30x30 for test); ensure n=len(g) handles all.
 * Subtle miss: In qualifying 2x2 for 3, adjacency check is flawed—code only checks horizontal left/right for the square's cells, but expectations suggest broader "exposed" or "leaf-like" criteria (e.g., not fully enclosed).
 * 0 can be part of larger structures but only recolored if criteria met; many 0s in expectations remain 0, indicating not all empties are stems or isolations.
 * Blue=1 interactions are specific to "upward" (vertical above), suggesting directionality like growth from base.
 * No recoloring of other colors (e.g., 2,6 stay as-is in expectations).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple

def is_valid(x: int, y: int, n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n

def get_used_colors(grid: List[List[int]], b: int) -> Set[int]:
    s: Set[int] = set()
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != b:
                s.add(cell)
    return s
```

```python
directions4: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
directions8: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]
```
These are useful for validation, color extraction, and adjacency (4-way for components, 8-way for attachments). The color_qualifying_squares function is partially helpful for 2x2 detection but broken in adjacency logic (only horizontal checks, misses cases). Flood-fill with stack for components is good but needs better condition checks (e.g., for has_same_row and attached_to_green).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of rules.
 * Training 1: Generated over-colored many areas to 3 and 5 (e.g., bottom-right 3s and 5s where expected has 3s but keeps 0s and 2s unchanged; top-left 2x2 became 3 but expected keeps as 2; isolated 0s partially colored to 5 but some 5s appear where expected has 0s or 2s; stem logic misidentified, coloring extra 5s in rows without proper attachment).
 * Training 1 mismatches: Expected has 2s in top-left and bottom-left unchanged, many 0s preserved (e.g., vertical chains of 0s next to 2s stay 0, not 5); generated has 3s there and extra 5s (e.g., row 3 col 16-17 as 5 but expected 5 only in specific spots); unknown why stem=2 wasn't chosen correctly, leading to wrong 5 placements.
 * Training 2: Generated colored some 0s/empties to 5 incorrectly (e.g., row 1 col 11-12 as 5 but expected 6; row 5 col 0 as 5 but expected 4; bottom 7s partially to 5 but expected keeps 7s); 3s correct in some 2x2 but missed propagating to adjacent 6s or 4s; blue=1 logic absent, so no upward 0 coloring; over-colored stems without row/adjacency checks.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Expected has 6s as a separate component (possibly petals) unchanged, 4s in specific chains, 7s at bottom; generated has 5s overwriting potential 6/4/7 areas (e.g., row 7 col 0 as 5 but expected 4); subtle: missed that some 3s attach to non-stem colors like 6, not coloring them to 5.
 * Training 3: Generated under-colored some areas (e.g., row 4 col 13-14 as 3 but expected 2; row 5 col 12 as 6 but expected 2; many 1s and 6s unchanged correctly but 5s over-applied in left column); stem logic colored extra 5s (e.g., row 10 col 14 as 5 but expected 6 or unchanged); isolated 0s not present, but blue=1 attachments missed upward specificity.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Expected has 2s in mid-left (rows 4-5 col 13-14) as a distinct element, 6s in chains (e.g., row 11 col 6-7 as 1 but wait, expected has 1s there? No, generated has 3s where expected 1/6; unknown why 2x2 detection failed for certain colors); 5s in top but generated spreads them incorrectly.
 * Overall: 2x2 to 3 works in some spots (e.g., training 1 top 3s) but over-applies without proper adjacency; stem selection picks wrong color (e.g., colors 0 as stem instead of 2); 0 to 5 rules partial (isolated good, but blue-upward misses directionality, and components over-colored if OR instead of AND); no handling for other colors like 2/6 as potential centers/petal unchanged.
 * Function color_qualifying_squares is partially helpful but broken (adjacency only horizontal, should be broader exposure check); get_used_colors and flood-fill stack are essential and correct for components.
 * No unhelpful functions stand out, but hardcoded blue=1 limits generality (if blue varies, fails); visited matrices reset per rule is good but inefficient for large grids like test.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3s in long horizontal/vertical lines (e.g., rows 2-3 cols 3-11 and 15-21 as solid 3s, but likely input has sparse colors needing only specific 2x2 qualified; this suggests 2x2 detection generalized wrongly to lines, not just squares).
 * Many 5s appear in scattered spots (e.g., row 8 col 6-7,9 as 5/0/5, but 0 remains—isolated rule partial; row 10 col 6-8 as 5s where possibly stem but over-colored without row match).
 * 1s and 9s preserved in clusters (good for unchanged elements), but 0s like row 8 col 7 remain 0 (correct if not isolated/attached), yet surrounding 5s suggest missed component merging.
 * Bottom sections (rows 18-25) have 5s in row 18-20 col 21-23, possibly from isolated 0s or stems, but chains of 1s and 9s unchanged—looks plausible for attachments but likely incorrect due to training failures (e.g., no upward blue checks visible, and 3s in row 25 col 13-15 may be wrong 2x2).
 * Overall, test output has too many 3s (line-filling instead of square-specific) and partial 5s, missing preservation of 0s/2-like elements; doesn't make sense as a "plant" structure—appears noisy, not structured like expectations' clean components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where components (connected groups of cells with the same non-background value) are identified and recolored based on visibility from the left or top edges, with special rules for certain backgrounds (e.g., bg=8 treats bottom 2's as 3's), followed by vertical downward filling and connected flooding to propagate color 5 into empty (0) areas from seeds like 1,3,5. The goal appears to be rendering or "painting" visible structures and their shadows or fills correctly, leaving internal holes or occluded areas as 0.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells properly; 4-connected would split some objects incorrectly.
 * Visibility from left: A component is "visible" if any of its cells has no non-background/non-zero cells to its left in the same row.
 * Visibility from top: Similar, but checked column-wise upward; however, the current check is per-cell and may overcount if not aggregated properly.
 * Recoloring rules: Odds (except 5) to 3 if left-visible or (top-visible with specific row/width conditions like min_i <=1 and width=1, or min_i=2 and width>1); evens (non-2) to 5 under similar visibility. For bg=8, override bottom-touching 2's to 3 regardless.
 * Post-recoloring: Vertical fill downward from {1,3,5} seeds into 0's (column-wise, like gravity), then flood-fill (8-directional) from {3,5} into remaining 0's, but this seems to overfill occluded/hole areas that should stay 0.
 * Subtleties: Internal 0's (holes) must remain 0 even if floodable; visibility conditions are heuristic and fail for complex shapes (e.g., the width-based top-visibility hacks suggest trying to detect "protrusions" but miss multi-row objects). Background varies (8,9,7,4), and present colors include evens/odds but exclude bg and sometimes 2/5. Bottom-touching for special cases uses a threshold like n-4, which is arbitrary and may not generalize. Flooding ignores boundaries, leading to spillover into unintended areas. No handling for diagonal occlusions or layered visibility. Ensure out-grid starts as copy to preserve originals before modifications.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]

def get_size(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return len(g)

def extract_components(g: List[List[int]], target_val: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not visited[i][j] and g[i][j] == target_val:
                component = []
                queue = collections.deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                component.append((i, j))
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == target_val:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                            component.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This extracts 8-connected components for a specific value, essential for isolating objects.)

```python
def get_bbox(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not comp:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    min_i = min(i for i, j in comp)
    max_i = max(i for i, j in comp)
    min_j = min(j for i, j in comp)
    max_j = max(j for i, j in comp)
    return min_i, max_i, min_j, max_j
```
(Computes bounding box for component analysis, like width for visibility heuristics.)

```python
def has_top_visible(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    for i, j in comp:
        visible = True
        for k in range(i):
            if g[k][j] != bg and g[k][j] != 0:
                visible = False
                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False

def has_left_visible(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    m = len(g[0])
    for i, j in comp:
        visible = True
        for l in range(j):
            if g[i][l] != bg and g[i][l] != 0:
                visible = False
                break
        if visible:
            return True
    return False
```
(These check per-component visibility from top/left by testing if any cell in the component has a clear line of sight; useful but overly permissive as they return True if ANY cell is visible, potentially recoloring whole components incorrectly.)

```python
def touches_bottom(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return max((i for i, j in comp), default=-1) >= n - 4
```
(Checks if component reaches near bottom; the n-4 threshold is specific/heuristic and may need tuning.)

```python
def fill_vertical_down(out: List[List[int]], seeds: set, target: int):
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])
    for j in range(m):
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                i += 1
                while i < n and out[i][j] == 0:
                    out[i][j] = target
                    i += 1
            i += 1
```
(Fills 0's downward from seed columns; simulates gravity but doesn't stop at obstacles, leading to overfill.)

```python
def flood_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]], seeds: set, target: int):
    n = len(out)
    m = len(out[0])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    queue = collections.deque()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if out[i][j] in seeds:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                        out[ni][nj] = target
                        visited[ni][nj] = True
                        queue.append((ni, nj))
    while queue:
        i, j = queue.popleft()
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0 and not visited[ni][nj]:
                out[ni][nj] = target
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(8-directional flood from seeds into 0's; helpful for connected fills but overfills closed holes and ignores visibility/occlusion.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all three training examples by over-recoloring and over-filling 0 areas that should remain empty (holes or shadows).
 * Train 1 (bg=8): Generated incorrectly recolored internal 5's (e.g., row 3 col 9=5 vs expected 0; row 4 col 9=5 vs 0) and filled vertical/horizontal 5's into what should be 0 holes (e.g., row 8 col 10=5 vs 0); special bottom 2-to-3 worked partially but flood overdid it in columns 16-17. Visibility heuristics failed to leave central voids empty.
 * Train 2 (bg=9): Generated mismatched recoloring, e.g., top row col 7-8=7 (odds) stayed 7 but expected 3; row 1 col 3-4=3 (odds to 3) but row 0 col 7-8 should be 3 not 7; evens like 4 stayed but some 6's (evens) not recolored to 5 where visible; vertical fill from 3/5 overfilled unrelated areas (e.g., row 2 col 13=5 vs expected 4).
 * Train 3 (bg=7): Generated left some odds as 3 where expected 5 (e.g., row 1 col 4-9=6? Wait, 6 even but code treats evens non-2 to 5; actually row 1 col 4-5=3 vs expected 5, suggesting wrong source sets—odds to 3 but some should be 5?); under-recolored top structures (row 1-2 col 4-9 should be 5's but partial 3's); no overfill noted but mismatches in blob shapes (e.g., row 2 col 10-13=6 vs expected 5).
 * extract_components and visibility functions are essential and mostly correct but visibility logic (e.g., width conditions) is too rigid/heuristic, missing multi-part objects or diagonal views.
 * fill_vertical_down and flood_from_seeds are helpful for propagation but broken for this puzzle as they don't respect occlusions/holes—cause main errors by filling everything reachable.
 * Special bg=8 handling for bottom 2's is relevant but threshold (n-4) is arbitrary and may not catch all "bottom" cases.
 * Overall, source sets (odds to green_src=3, evens non-2 to orange_src=5) seem partially right but fail when colors like 5/2 are present or visibility is blocked subtly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=4) does not look correct; it over-recolors large horizontal 3's in rows 2-4 cols 2-22 (likely odds visible from left/top) but leaves some internals as 3 instead of filling to 5 or leaving 0; vertical fills propagate 5's downward in cols 6-8 (from row 8 5's) and flood 5's into scattered areas (e.g., row 9 col 22-24=9? Wait, 9's stay but nearby 1's flood to 5 incorrectly, like row 5 col 21=9 vs should probably stay if occluded). It mismatches expected behavior by filling holes (e.g., around the 1's and 9's clusters in rows 5-7, where isolated 0's get 5'd) and not handling the complex L-shapes/ protrusions properly—e.g., the bottom-right 5's in row 19-21 seem underfilled compared to training patterns. Without exact expected, it appears over-aggressive like training fails, missing subtle occlusions in the dense 3/1/5/9 layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with background as the dominant color and 0 as empty space) to identify connected components (objects) of non-background colors, recolor them based on visibility rules from the top, left, or right edges (ignoring background and empty cells), apply special rules for certain colors like 2, and then flood-fill empty (0) spaces connected to specific "seed" colors to recolor them, likely simulating some kind of visibility or occlusion in a visual diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must consider all eight directions to group touching cells of the same color correctly.
 * Visibility checks: For top visibility, check if any cell in the component has only background or empty above it in the same column; similar for left (same row, leftward) and right (same row, rightward). Non-empty, non-background cells block visibility.
 * Recoloring logic: Odd original colors (except possibly 1) seem to map to 3 if visible from left or (top with conditions like width >2 or not right-visible or at top row); even to 5. But this is inconsistent across examples—e.g., color 1 stays 1 or becomes visible without change in some cases.
 * Special rule for color 2: When background is 8 and the component touches near the bottom (e.g., row >= n-4), recolor to 3; otherwise, it may stay 2 or follow other rules, but it's skipped in main loop.
 * Used colors are non-background, positive cells; background is g[0][0], assumed uniform.
 * Flood fill: Only fills 0s connected (8-way) to seeds {1,3,5,7,9} with 5, but this seems overly aggressive and incorrect—expected outputs show many 0s remaining unfilled, and fills should perhaps be more selective (e.g., only certain areas or not at all in some cases). Seeds include recolored cells, so order matters.
 * Grids vary in size; assume rectangular, no wrapping.
 * Subtle: Some components like 1 or 6 may not recolor at all if not visible or per rules; empty spaces (0s) inside/outside objects matter for connectivity but aren't filled unless connected to seeds post-recoloring.
 * Potential misses: Width calculation (max_j - min_j +1) for conditions; min_i==0 for top-row priority; right visibility blocks some top-based recoloring.
 * Flood fill starts from seeds but uses directions including diagonals, and marks with 5, but visited prevents requeue—however, it seeds from all adjacent 0s initially, which may overfill.
 * Color 2 often remains 2 in expected, except in special cases; other evens/odds have specific mappings only if visible.

(This performs 8-connected flood fill from seeds to fill 0s with 5; helpful but likely broken as it overfills—expected outputs retain many 0s, so may need different seeds, fill color, or connectivity rules.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt processes components and visibility correctly in structure but fails recoloring logic: skips color 2 in main loop but applies special bottom-touch rule for bg=8, which works partially but doesn't match all cases (e.g., in Train 1, bottom 2s become 3 but upper 2s stay 2 while expected keeps them 2).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated fills many internal 0s with 5 (e.g., rows 3-8, cols 9-13) where expected keeps 0; recolors left 2s to nothing (stay 2? but expected 2); changes positions (3,3)-(3,4) to 5 where expected 0; (9,3)-(10,4) to 3 where expected 1; overfills right column with 5s correctly in some spots but adds extras.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated keeps some 4/6/7 as-is or recolors wrongly (e.g., row 5 col 1-3 as 5,5,5 where expected 4,6,6; row 13 col 12-13 as 3,3 where expected 7,7); flood fill adds 5s in wrong places like row 0 col 6; bottom 3s wrong (expected 7,7).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated recolors some 6s to nothing or wrong (e.g., row 6 col 14 as 5 where expected 6; row 12 col 16 as 5 where expected 6); keeps most but flood-fills extras like row 4 col 2 as 5 (expected 5? wait similar); row 16 col 3 as 6 where expected 6 but context wrong; special 2s at bottom stay 2 correctly but some 5s overplaced.
 * Recoloring condition "if left_vis or (top_vis and (w > 2 or not right_vis or min_i == 0))" is too permissive, leading to over-recoloring odds to 3 and evens to 5; doesn't handle color 1 (stays?), 6,7,9 properly—e.g., 1 often stays 1 if visible.
 * Flood fill with seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and fill to 5 is unhelpful/broken: overfills connected 0s in all trains (e.g., Train 1 fills object interiors that should stay 0; Train 2 fills unrelated areas); perhaps seeds should be edge-visible only, or no fill at all, or fill to background/different color.
 * extract_components is helpful and correct for grouping; visibility functions are mostly correct but right_vis check is per-cell from right, which may not align with full component visibility.
 * Special rule for 2 only when bg=8 and bottom-touch is partially helpful but too narrow—Train 3 (bg=7) keeps 2s as 2 without change, suggesting 2 often unchanged unless specific.
 * Used set collection is good but skips b and 0 correctly; however, processing order (for c in used, skipping 2) causes issues if 2 interacts with visibility for others.
 * No handling for color 4/6/9 specifics; e.g., in Train 2, 4s seem to stay or become visible without recolor in some paths.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It recolors long horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 to 3 (likely odd color visible from top/left), but keeps many 3s as 3 throughout without change, suggesting the original grid has many 3s that stay; however, 1s stay 1, 5s appear in some clusters (e.g., row 8 col 6-8), 9s in bottom-right, but flood fill seems absent (no 5s filling 0s, assuming originals have 0s—output shows no 0s visible, but likely over-recolored or filled wrongly).
 * Compared to patterns in trains, it under-fills: Expected likely retains internal 0s (like Train 1's object holes) but this seems to have recolored components like vertical 3s on left to 3, scattered 1s stay, but 5s/9s placed without clear visibility (e.g., row 12 col 13-15 as 9s may be even color visible from right?); no massive 5-fills, which is better than trains but still mismatches if 0s should remain.
 * Subtleties missed: Test has large grid (30 cols?), complex nested components (e.g., 1s inside 3s/5s); output treats 3s as visible (stay/change?), but if core rule is to highlight visible fronts (3 left/top, 5 right/bottom?), this partially does but ignores depths/occlusions fully.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (components extracted, some recolored by visibility) but likely wrong in not filling 0s selectively and over-retaining originals like 3s/1s without occlusion checks; e.g., bottom 9s may be back-facing (should be 5?), and no special for 2 (none present).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to process a colored grid by identifying connected components (blobs) of non-background, non-empty cells, applying color changes based on visibility from the top or left edges and parity rules, handling special cases for certain colors and positions (e.g., bottom-placed 2's when background is 8), and then selectively filling adjacent empty (0) cells as "stems" without overfilling entire connected regions of 0's. The output transforms the input grid according to these rules to reveal a structured pattern, likely representing objects with stems or supports that don't fully flood empty spaces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always g[0][0]; ignore it and 0's when identifying used colors or components.
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), extracted via BFS/DFS flood-fill; empty components should be skipped.
 * Visibility checks: Top-visible if at least one cell in the component has only background or 0's above it in the same column (no blocking non-bg/0 cells). Left-visible if at least one cell has only background or 0's to the left in the same row.
 * Color change rules: Process used colors in sorted order, skipping 2 always and 1 if background==8. For odd colors (e.g., 1,3): change entire component to 3 if top-visible. For even colors (e.g., 4,6): change to 5 if left-visible or (top-visible AND all cells in the same row). Do not change background or skipped colors.
 * Special case: If background==8, identify components of 2; if any cell's row >= n-4 (near bottom), change the whole component to 3 (overrides other rules? applied after main changes).
 * Stem filling: Only fill 0's that are directly below or adjacent to changed components (e.g., 1,3,5) in a stem-like manner (vertical lines downward), but do NOT flood-fill entire connected 0 regions—leave long vertical 0's as empty unless they terminate in a specific way (e.g., connect to bottom or other objects). Seeds for filling are 1,3,5, but propagation should be limited (e.g., only downward or adjacent without full BFS).
 * Subtleties: Same-row check for even colors uses set of rows in component ==1. Changes happen in-place on a copy of the grid. Order matters: change visible components first, then special bottom 2's, then fill stems. Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, test 30x?); ensure bounds checking. 0's are empty space, not part of components. In examples, stems often remain 0's for height, with 5's only at bases or connections—overfilling breaks this.
 * Potential misses: Diagonals in connectivity can merge unexpected components; visibility ignores 0's as non-blocking. Special rule only for 2's near bottom when bg=8—may not apply elsewhere. Filling must simulate "drawing" stems downward without sideways or full propagation.

```
(Partially helpful for the specific bg=8 bottom-2 rule; correctly changes qualifying 2's to 3's, but applied after main changes—may need reordering if 2's are altered earlier.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating incomplete understanding of rules, especially stem filling.
 * Train 1: Bottom 2's correctly changed to 3's via special_bottom_two (matches expected in rows 13-15, cols 10-11). 1's correctly skipped/not changed (remain 1's in rows 1-2 and 9-10). 2's on left (rows 3-4, cols 2-3) correctly skipped/unchanged. However, main change_visible_components over-applied 5's to some even components (e.g., generated 5's in row 3 col 9, row 5-7 cols 2/4/9/13, where expected has 0's or unchanged). fill_stems massively overfilled vertical/horizontal 0's with 5's (e.g., entire columns 9,13,16 filled with 5's from rows 3-11, but expected keeps long 0's in those stems, with 5's only at specific bottoms like row 3 col 16=5, row 11 col 15=5; unknown why partial but not full fill). Result: Generated has dense 5's grids, expected has sparse 0-stem structures.
 * Train 2: Background 9. Some even colors (e.g., 6's) partially changed to 5's correctly (e.g., rows 1-2 cols 11-12 remain 6's, but expected has 5's there—wait, mismatch: generated has 6's, expected 5's, so under-changed). 4's over-changed to 5's in places (e.g., row 0 col 9=4 in generated but expected 5; row 5 col 1=5 generated but expected 4). 3's (odd) not changed to 3 (already 3, but visibility? top-visible likely, but no action needed). fill_stems overfilled 0's (not shown, but generated has extra 5's like row 0 col 6=5 expected 5 ok, but row 5 col 0=9? Wait, grids differ in empties; overall, generated has misplaced 4/5/6 vs expected's structured 4-stem bases and 5-changes). Result: Mismatches in color swaps (e.g., top 4 to 5 missed) and likely stem overfill (e.g., row 9 col 4=4 generated, expected 4 ok, but row 12 col 12=4 generated, expected 4 ok—subtle diffs in 5/4 positions).
 * Train 3: Background 7. Odd 3's in row 1 cols 2-3 changed? Generated keeps 3's but expected changes to 5's (rows 1-2 cols 4-9=5's, but generated has 6's there—under-changed even 6's). 1's (odd) in rows 7-11 cols 10-11 remain 1's, but expected unchanged ok. 5's already present, skipped. 6's partially changed to 5's (e.g., row 2 cols 10-13=6 generated, expected 5's). 2's at bottom unchanged ok. fill_stems overfilled (e.g., row 1 cols 4-9=5's generated where expected 5's ok, but row 16 cols 3/15=6/1 generated? Diffs in 5/6 placements; generated has extra 5's in row 0? No, but vertical fills wrong, e.g., row 4 col 13=2 generated but expected 2 ok—main issue is missed changes for visible evens/odds). Result: Under-changed visible components (e.g., top row of 6's to 5's missed) and partial stem issues.
 * change_visible_components is mostly helpful but buggy: skips correctly but misapplies even-rule (e.g., same_row check may fail if component spans rows slightly); processes in sorted order ok, but doesn't handle all parities (e.g., 3 odd already 3, no change). special_bottom_two works for train1 but irrelevant for others (bg!=8). fill_stems is broken/not helpful: full BFS flood from any adjacent 0 to seeds 1/3/5 overfills connected empties (e.g., turns stem columns into solid 5's, but expected keeps 0's for height, filling only bases or partial downward). Do not use current fill_stems—replace with downward-only fill from object bottoms. extract_components and visibility functions are essential and correct—keep them. get_used_colors skips bg/0 correctly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-applies 5's similar to training failures, filling dense vertical/horizontal stems (e.g., rows 5-10 cols 6-8=5's from the 5-blob, but likely should be partial 0's downward; rows 12-15 cols 13-15/25-27=9's unchanged but adjacent 0's? Wait, test input has 9's as objects, expected probably changes visible 9's (odd) to 3 if top-vis, but generated keeps many 9's and fills extra 5's around 1's/3's/5's, e.g., row 6 col 22=3 input? Generated has 5's spreading left/right, creating solid bars where expected likely has thin stems (0's) below 1's/3's like in train1). 3's (odd, top-visible in rows 2-4 cols 2-22) should change to 3 (already), but adjacent 0's overfilled with 5's (e.g., row 5 col 5=4 input? Generated fills below). 1's (odd) in scattered positions (e.g., rows 5-12 cols 2-3/10-11) top-visible likely, but if bg=4, no skip, so change to 3? Generated keeps 1's and overfills below with 5's (e.g., row 13 cols 3-4=1's become ? But output shows 1's persisting, stems filled). 9's (odd) in rows 12-22 cols 3-5/13-15/23-25 should change to 3 if top-vis, but generated keeps 9's and fills around. 5's already, no change. Overall, output has too many 5's (overfill) and missed changes for odds/evens (e.g., no 3's from 1's/9's), making it look like a filled-in version rather than structured stems; does not match sparse 0-stem pattern from expected trainings—account for bg=4 (no skip 1), downward-only stem fill from bottoms of 1/3/5, and full visibility changes for odds to 3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based color (number) manipulation, where connected components of specific colors are altered based on whether they touch certain borders (like top or left edges), and enclosed empty spaces (0s) are selectively filled under specific conditions, with rules varying by grid size or pattern. The goal is to transform the input grid to match expected outputs by applying these operations correctly without over- or under-applying changes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-way (including diagonals), and changes only apply if the entire component meets a touch condition (e.g., any cell in component at row <=1 for top, col <=1 for left); background color is from top-left and not changed.
 * For enclosed 0s: Not all 0s are filled—only truly enclosed ones, but the flood fill must start correctly; starting from row=1 or col=1 adjacent 0s seems incorrect as it may flood too much or too little; expected outputs show selective filling (e.g., some 0s remain unfilled if connected to borders in subtle ways, or only inner holes are filled with 5).
 * Rules are size-specific or pattern-specific: For n=18, 2s change to 3s only if NOT touching top, but expected keeps some 2s as 2s and fills specific 0s to 5; for n=15, 4 to 5 and 7 to 3 if touching top, but expected preserves some 4s/7s and changes others differently (e.g., some 6s to 4?); for n=20, 1 to 3 if top-touching, 6 to 5 if left-touching, but expected fills some 6s/3s to 5 in non-touching areas and keeps others.
 * Subtle elements: Touch conditions might be stricter (e.g., touch row 0 exactly, not <=1); components of multiple colors aren't handled (current code only changes single-color components); order of operations matters (e.g., fill 0s before or after changes); background (8/9/7/4) never changes; for n=30 test, likely combines filling enclosed 0s (but input has few/no 0s visible), top-touching 1/9 to 3, but may need left-touch or other for 9s.
 * Easy to miss: 0s connected diagonally to borders stay 0 (not filled); some "enclosed" areas are actually border-connected via diagonals; no global mapping—apply per color/component; grid size determines rule set, but test n=30 suggests combining example rules (fill + top changes for 1 and 9).
 * Considerations across attempts: No prior attempts shown, but this one assumes size-based rules; must validate components don't overlap post-change; flood fill for 0s should invert (fill unvisited inner 0s, but start from actual border 0s, not row/col=1); potential for multiple passes or color-specific fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly identifies size-based rules and uses 8-way components with touch conditions, which captures core mechanic of border-touching changes (e.g., change_components function works for isolated color swaps).
 * What worked: Background unchanged; component detection seems accurate; for n=20, some 1->3 and 6->5 changes align partially with expected (e.g., top 3s and left 5s in places).
 * What didn't work: All training examples incorrect—over-applies changes (e.g., in n=18, changes 2->3 where expected keeps 2s, fills too many 0s to 5 instead of leaving most as 0s); touch condition uses <=1 (too loose, expected may need ==0); fill_enclosed_zeros broken (starts from row/col=1, flooding incorrectly—e.g., in n=18 generated fills inner 0s to 5 but expected leaves chains of 0s unfilled, only fills isolated right-side 5s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has 3s at [3,2-3] where expected 2s; 5s at [3,9],[4,9] etc. where expected 0s; unknown why some 0-chains filled vs. expected (perhaps flood start wrong, connecting to non-border).
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated changes top-touch 4->5/7->3 but keeps some wrong (e.g., [2,13-14] 6s stay 6, expected 4; [6,13-14] 7->3 but expected 7s elsewhere; [10,2-3] 7s stay 7, expected changed); some 4s preserved incorrectly.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated changes 1->3 top but expected fills 3/6 areas to 5 non-touching (e.g., [1,4-9] 6->5 but generated keeps 6; [2,10-13] 6 stay, expected 5); 6->5 left partial but misses inner fills.
 * Inferred n=30 rule (fill 0s + 1/9->3 top) over-applies 5s (no 0s visible in input, but output has 5s where? perhaps assuming hidden 0s, but changes 1/9 to 3 correctly in some top spots).
 * Function fill_enclosed_zeros is broken/not helpful (wrong flood start leads to incorrect filling—don't use without fixing to border-start).
 * change_components is helpful/essential for border rules but needs stricter touch (==0) and multi-pass for order.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (for n=30) does not look fully correct— it applies fill_enclosed_zeros (inserting 5s in potential empty areas like [8,6-8],[9,6-8],[10,6-8] which may be inner holes) and changes top-touching 1s/9s to 3 (e.g., [2,2-4] 9->? but output shows 9s, wait no—output keeps many 9s/1s, changes some to 3? Wait, looking: many 1s remain 1, 9s remain 9, 5s appear in [8-10,6-8] perhaps from fill, but input has 5s already at [8,6-8]; no visible 0s in provided output/input snippet, so fill may be noop or wrong; top 1s at [2-4,5-11] remain 1, not to 3—suggests touch_condition failed (e.g., not detecting top-touch for those components).
 * Output missing expected changes: Likely needs 9->3 for top-touching 9s (e.g., [2-4,2-4] 9s should change? but stay 9); 5s in bottom [19-21,21-23] may be new fills but input has no 0s there—perhaps over-filling non-existent 0s or misdetecting; structure has many unchanged 1/9 blobs, so rule inference wrong (maybe 9 changes only if left-touch, not top).
 * Does not make sense overall: Too many unchanged elements (e.g., large 1-blobs at top/mid stay 1, expected probably 3s); 5s scattered but not matching enclosed logic; suggests program applies rules but touch/fill buggy for large n=30.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a background color (always the value at [0][0]), empty spaces (0s), and various non-background colored regions (blobs or components made of the same number). The goal appears to be identifying connected components of the same color, labeling them with specific numbers (like 3 for top-visible, 5 for side-visible or enclosed) based on visibility from the top and left edges, filling enclosed 0s with 5 while leaving border-connected 0s as 0, and preserving original colors for components that don't meet visibility criteria or are already "internal."

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be same-color only (8-connectivity including diagonals); the previous code incorrectly connected different colors together as one component, leading to over-merging and incorrect labeling (e.g., in train1, separate 1s and 2s in expected were likely merged and relabeled as 5s).
 * Visibility from top: A component is top-visible if at least one of its cells has only background or 0s above it in the column (no other non-bg blocking); similarly for left (no non-bg to the left in row). But labeling isn't uniform—only certain components get relabeled to 3 (top) or 5 (left/enclosed), while others retain originals (e.g., internal or non-visible blobs like the 2s and 1s in train1 expected stay as-is, but bottom 3s and some 5s are new).
 * Enclosed 0s: Internal 0s (not reachable from borders via other 0s) should be filled with 5, but border-adjacent or connected 0s remain 0 (e.g., in train1 expected, some 0s stay 0 while others become 5; the code's flood fill starts too aggressively by enqueuing inner border cells like row 1, causing over-filling).
 * Original colors are preserved for non-visible or specific components (e.g., train1 expected keeps 1s and 2s but introduces 3s at bottom and 5s in enclosed/right areas; train2 expected has originals like 6,4,7 preserved/changed selectively).
 * Order matters: Top visibility labeling should happen first (to 3), then left (to 5, without overwriting top ones unless specified), then enclosed fill— but conditions must use the original grid, and changes only apply if the entire component meets the criterion without partial overlaps.
 * Subtle: 0s are treated separately—not part of colored components—but can block visibility if non-bg is above/left. Bg is ignored for connectivity but blocks visibility. Components touching both top and left might need special handling (e.g., prioritize top as 3, not overwrite to 5). In expected outputs, new labels like 3/5 appear in specific regions (bottom/enclosed in train1, scattered in train2/3), suggesting rules beyond simple visibility (possibly size, enclosure, or projection-based).
 * Across attempts: No originals provided, but differences show the code over-labels everything non-bg to 3/5, ignores same-color grouping, and fills too many 0s (e.g., train3 generated all 5s in blobs, expected preserves/keeps variety with 1,2,6). Test input likely has multiple same-color blobs; uniform 5s suggest missing per-color processing and visibility nuance.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals in connectivity (code has it right), but visibility checks must skip 0s/bg only (code has it partially). Enclosed fill must not propagate through non-0s, and start strictly from border 0s (code's inner enqueue is broken). Some components get relabeled only if "exposed" without being pre-labeled (e.g., anonymous colors become 3/5, named like 1/2 stay).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (the provided program) correctly implemented 8-connectivity for components and basic visibility checks, but failed by treating all non-bg non-0 as one color group (merging different colors like 1 and 2), leading to over-labeling everything visible to 3 then 5 (overwriting originals).
 * change_components function is helpful for conditional relabeling but broken: it changes all colors in a merged component, doesn't preserve originals for non-visible, and applies left visibility on original g but overwrites out sequentially (e.g., top-visible become 3, then get overwritten to 5 if left-visible too).
 * fill_enclosed_zeros is partially helpful (identifies enclosed 0s) but broken: enqueues inner border cells (e.g., row 1 if 0), causing border-connected 0s to be wrongly marked visited and not filled, or over-propagation; expected keeps some border 0s as 0.
 * get_background and copy_grid are correct and useful.
 * In train1: Generated changed top-left 2s to 5s (row3: [8,8,5,5,...] vs expected [8,8,2,2,...]), filled too many 0s to 5 (e.g., right column has 5s where expected has 0s initially then 5 selectively), bottom 5s/3s mismatched (generated has scattered 5s, expected has structured 3s/5s); originals like 1s became 5s.
 * In train2: Generated mostly uniform 5s (e.g., row1: [9,9,...,5,5,5,5,...] vs expected varied 5,3,6), completely lost original diversity (4,6,7 preserved in expected); unknown why, but likely due to merging all non-9 into one big component labeled 5.
 * In train3: Generated uniform 5s in all blob areas (e.g., row2: [7,7,5,5,...] vs expected [7,7,3,3,5,...] with 3s for top, and scattered 1,2,6), over-filled 0s/enclosed to 5 without preserving structure; bottom 2s in expected missing.
 * Overall: No training samples passed (all INCORRECT); attempt shows partial understanding of components/visibility/fill but misses same-color grouping, preservation of originals, and precise enclosed logic. Function change_components is useful if fixed for per-color; extract_components (my suggestion above) is essential for future to avoid merging.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It's mostly bg=4 on borders and uniform 5s filling all internal blob areas and many 0s (e.g., rows 3-4 have long 5 stretches where test input likely has varied same-color blobs like in training), with no preservation of original colors (e.g., no 1,2,3 variety as in expected trains) and over-filling (e.g., scattered 5s in what should be structured components). This suggests the code merged all non-4 into 5s due to visibility/fill errors, but expected would likely have selective 3s for top-visible blobs, 5s for left/enclosed, and kept originals for internal ones— the uniformity indicates missing per-color processing and wrong 0 handling (e.g., some 0s should stay 0 if border-connected).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where connected components (blobs) of specific colors are identified, evaluated for positional properties like visibility from top/left/right edges and touching bottom/left, and then recolored to target values (e.g., 3 for green-like, 5 for orange-like) based on rules, with special cases for certain backgrounds and colors, followed by flood-filling empty spaces (0s) adjacent to "seeds" (1,3,5) using 8-connectivity to propagate color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells, ignoring background (bg) and 0s.
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; non-bg cells block visibility in columns/rows.
 * Top visibility: A component is top-visible if any of its cells has only bg or 0 above it in the same column (no other colors blocking from row 0).
 * Left visibility: Similar, any cell with only bg or 0 to its left in the same row.
 * Right visibility: Any cell with only bg or 0 (or possibly 1?) to its right in the same row; the provided has_right_visible excludes 1 but includes bg/0, which may be buggy.
 * For green colors (1,7,9): Change to 3 if top-visible AND (not right-visible OR component starts at row 0).
 * For orange colors (4,6): Change to 5 if (top-visible OR left-visible) AND (not right-visible OR starts at row 0).
 * Special case: If bg==8, change color 2 components to 3 if they touch bottom (last row or adjacent to bg in last row) AND do NOT touch left (first column or adjacent to bg in first column).
 * Flood fill: After recoloring, fill all 0s that are 8-connected to any 1,3, or 5 (seeds) with 5; start by marking immediate adjacent 0s to seeds as 5, then propagate.
 * Subtleties: 0s are empty/transparent and don't block visibility but can be filled later; components must be processed in order (greens then oranges?); min row of component affects rules; flood fill uses 8-connect but only changes 0s, not overwriting existing colors; backgrounds vary (8,9,7 across examples), so rules must adapt; right visibility may incorrectly exclude 1 (as in code), leading to over-changing; touching checks allow adjacency to bg for "touching" edges; entire grid edges matter, but inner 0s near edges can affect visibility.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill is post-processing and can fill large areas, but only from seeds—unconnected 0s stay 0; components of same color are processed separately; no diagonal-only connections without full 8-dir; special case only for bg=8 and color=2, not generalized.

            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and out[ni][nj] == 0:
                out[ni][nj] = 5
                queue.append((ni, nj))
```
(This is helpful for post-processing empty spaces, but may overfill if seeds are misidentified.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of components and flood fill but incorrect application of rules.
 * Train 1: Generated incorrectly changed some 0s to 5s via flood fill where expected keeps 0s (e.g., positions like [3][9], [4][4]); failed to change bottom-right 2s to 3s in special case (expected [14][10:12]=3, [15][4:6]=3, [15][6:8]=5 but generated kept 2s and misplaced 5s); over-applied right visibility exclusion of 1, leading to extra changes; flood fill didn't propagate correctly to some isolated 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated massively over-recolored almost the entire grid to 3/5 (e.g., bg cells to 3, many originals like 9/6/4/7 unchanged in expected but overwritten), ignoring bg=9; rules for green/orange misapplied (e.g., expected keeps most 4/6/7, changes some to 3/5 but generated flooded everything); no special case triggered since bg!=8; flood fill irrelevant as few 0s.
 * Train 3: Generated changed bg=7 cells to 3/5 everywhere except components (e.g., top row all 3 vs expected 7); misclassified components (e.g., large 6-blob to 3 instead of keeping/changing selectively to 5); flood fill not prominent but contributed to overfill; touches checks not used as no color 2; visibility rules over-applied, ignoring bg preservation.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for blob detection.
 * Visibility functions are mostly helpful but has_right_visible is buggy (excludes 1 arbitrarily, causing over-change in Train 1).
 * touches_bottom/left are helpful but only for special case, which failed in Train 1 (didn't trigger for bottom 2s).
 * flood_fill_from_seeds is helpful but over-aggressive in Train 1 (filled wrong 0s) and unnecessary/irrelevant in others.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the main program logic (color processing order, condition combinations like h_t and (not h_r or min_i==0)) is broken—combines rules incorrectly, doesn't preserve non-target colors/bg, and processes too many colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills massive areas with 5s (e.g., entire top/bottom rows, most of the grid except some inner components), turning what should be bg (likely 5 based on positions) into uniform 5s, and partially recolors inner blobs (e.g., 3s,9s,1s,4s kept/changed inconsistently) but floods adjacent 0s excessively.
 * Expected likely preserves bg=5 in borders/empty areas, selectively changes visible components (e.g., left 3-blob to 3 if green-like and top/left visible, right 1/4/9 blobs to 5 if orange-like), keeps isolated 0s as 0 if not connected to seeds, and flood-fills only connected empties to 5—generated ignores this, making the output look like a mostly solid 5 block with scattered originals, which doesn't match puzzle intent of targeted recoloring + selective fill.
 * Does not make sense: Over-flooding suggests seeds (1/3/5) were introduced too early or visibility rules misfired, connecting unrelated areas; subtle: Test has complex nested blobs (e.g., 1s inside 4s), so components must not leak across colors, but generated seems to have propagated 5s through 0s incorrectly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid to classify and recolor connected components (blobs) of specific colors based on rules like visibility from edges (top, left, right), size, position (e.g., near bottom or top rows), and background color, then flood-filling empty spaces (0's) with 5's starting from seed colors like 1,3,5,7,9 using 8-connectivity. The goal is to produce a modified grid where certain blobs are changed to 3 (green-like) or 5 (orange-like or fill), while preserving others, and ensuring the fill propagates correctly without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is determined from g[0][0] and excludes certain colors from processing (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} - {bg}).
 * Components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals), which is crucial for blob shapes but can merge unexpectedly if not handled.
 * Visibility rules: Top-visible if any cell in component has no non-bg/non-0 cells above it in the same column; left-visible if no blockers left in row; right-visible similarly but checking right side (note: right-visible check in code looks for blockers to the right, but logic may invert intent).
 * Size and position filters: For green (1,7,9), skip if >4 cells; use bounding box height/width (h,w) where w > h or (h==w and top position <=2 and not right-visible) triggers change to 3. For orange (4,6), skip if >6 cells or min row >3; change to 5 if top- or left-visible.
 * Special case for bg==8: Change bottom-touching 2-components to 3, but only if they touch near bottom (i >= n-5, which is arbitrary and may miss subtle bottom definitions).
 * Flood fill starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9} and spreads to adjacent 0's with 5, using 8-connectivity and visited to avoid revisits, but seeds themselves are not changed (only propagate from them).
 * Empty cells (0's) remain 0 unless filled; non-seed colors like 2,4,6 may stay or change based on rules.
 * Subtle: Flood fill uses directions including diagonals, but only fills 0's; it marks visited but sets to 5 immediately, which could block further spread if not careful. Also, components of size 1-4 for green or <=6 for orange with visibility/position are targeted, but over-application can change non-target blobs.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 18x18, 15x15, 20x20, 30x29?), so n,m dynamic; bottom-touching defined loosely (e.g., last 5 rows).
 * Potential misses: Right-visibility may be overused or inverted; flood fill seeds include changed colors (3,5), so order matters (changes before fill). No handling for vertical/horizontal dominance beyond w>h. Components must be fully connected; isolated cells count as components.

(Flood fills 0's from seeds using BFS with 8-connectivity; works but seeds propagate immediately from neighbors, which is correct if seeds are unchanged.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (bg=8), generated incorrectly changed left-side 2-blob cells (rows 3-7, cols 2-3) to 5 instead of leaving as 0/2, over-applied orange rules or flood; bottom 2's (rows 14-15, cols 10-11) correctly to 3, but some 5's in cols 14-16 overfilled where expected 0's; right 1's stayed 1 (correct), but flood missed some 0's turning to 5.
 * In training example 1, special bg=8 rule for bottom 2's worked partially (changed to 3), but green/orange rules over-applied to non-visible or large components, e.g., vertical structure in cols 9-10 got 5's where expected 0's.
 * In training example 2 (bg=9), generated kept some 5's and 3's correctly top-left but failed on right-side 6's (row2 col11-12 as 5 instead of 6, row3 col13 as 5? Wait, expected has 6,6,4 so under-changed); orange 4/6 blobs in rows5-6 cols1-3 stayed 4/6 (correct) but flood over-applied 5's in row1 col6? No major flood issue, but component extraction missed splitting or visibility for mid-grid 6's.
 * In training example 2, green 3's top-left correct, but size filter skipped some small components incorrectly; right-bottom 7's stayed 7 (correct, as non-green/orange), but a 5 in row1 col10 incorrect (expected 9? bg).
 * In training example 3 (bg=7), generated under-applied 5's to left 6-blob (rows1-2 cols4-5 as 3? No, as 6, but expected 5's for top parts); over-kept 6's in rows3-9 col2-3 where expected 5's in some; bottom 2's stayed 2 (correct); 1's stayed 1 (correct, perhaps non-target).
 * In training example 3, touches_bottom not triggered correctly for some, and visibility (top/left) missed for horizontal dominance; flood fill under-applied, leaving some 0's? But outputs show no 0's visible, differences in 3 vs 5 for 6-blobs.
 * extract_components is helpful and seems correct (8-connectivity matches blob shapes in diffs).
 * has_top_visible, has_left_visible, has_right_visible are essential but right_visible logic checks for no blockers to right (meaning visible from right edge?), which may be inverted—generated often fails when right-visible should block change.
 * flood_fill_from_seeds works for propagation but starts only from seeds' neighbors, not overwriting seeds; in trains, it overfills some 0's to 5 where expected 0 (e.g., train1 left structure).
 * Special bg==8 rule partially worked (bottom 2 to 3) but applied too broadly; general green/orange rules too aggressive on size/position (e.g., min_i <=3 too loose, len>4 skip misses small visible).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but touches_bottom with fixed -5 is heuristic and not general (breaks for varying grid heights).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (30x29? grid, bg=4) has many 5's already placed (e.g., row8 cols6-8 as 5,5,5; row19-21 cols21-23 as 5's), suggesting pre-flood changes, but looks over-filled—e.g., scattered 5's in row8 col6-8 may be from orange rule on 5? Input has 5's? Wait, the "generated output" includes original colors like 9's,1's,4's unchanged in places, with some 5's added (e.g., row8), but no visible 0's left, implying flood filled everything adjacent to seeds.
 * Test output does not look fully correct: It preserves large 1-blobs (e.g., rows3-4 cols5-12 as 1's, expected perhaps change to 3 if small/visible green), but adds 5's in isolated spots like row8 cols6-8 (possibly erroneous flood from nearby 5? Input has 5 there? No, input not given, but output has them as 5 while surrounding 1's/4's); bottom rows have 5's in row19-21 cols21-23, which may be correct fill but over-spreads to row22 col21 as 1? Wait, row22 has 1's.
 * Test output misses potential 3-changes for top 9/1 blobs (rows2-3 cols2-5,14-21 as 9/1, visible from top/left but stayed, violating green rule if size<=4); flood seems to have filled some but left paths open incorrectly (e.g., row12 col24-26 as 9's, possibly unfilled 0's? But output shows no 0's, all filled or colored).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (fills from seeds like 1,5,9 to 5 in empties), but incorrect due to unchanged green-like blobs (1,9) that should be 3 if visible/small, and possible over-change of 4's to 5 without position check; looks like rules applied but visibility/size thresholds wrong, leading to under-classification.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a colored grid (numbers represent colors) to identify connected components of specific "object" colors, evaluate them based on visibility from edges (top/left/right), size, shape (width vs height), and position (e.g., touching bottom), then change qualifying components to new colors like 3 (for green-like objects) or 5 (for orange-like objects), while leaving non-qualifying areas as 0 (empty) or background. Finally, perform a limited flood-fill from certain seeds (1,3,5) to propagate 5 into adjacent 0s, but only in ways that simulate "shadows" or fills without over-spreading to block visibility rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always g[0][0]; exclude it from object colors (e.g., green_colors = {1,7,9} minus {bg}; similar for orange {4,6}).
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals: up/down/left/right + diagonals), extracted via BFS/DFS flood-fill on exact color matches, ignoring bg and 0.
 * For green-like (1,7,9 except bg): Only small components (size <=4); must be top-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 above it in column); shape prefers wide (w > h) or left-visible (at least one cell with no non-bg/non-0 to left in row) or single-cell square at top without right visibility; change to 3 if qualified.
 * For orange-like (4,6 except bg): Slightly larger (size <=6); must have top-visible or left-visible; same shape preference as green; change to 5.
 * Special case: If bg==8, change bottom-touching (max row >= n-4? but this threshold seems arbitrary/wrong) components of 2 to 3.
 * Flood-fill: Only from seeds {1,3,5}, but propagate ONLY to adjacent 0s (8 directions), setting them to 5; however, this must be constrained to avoid filling areas that should remain 0 (e.g., "open" spaces or behind objects); current implementation over-fills indiscriminately, ignoring visibility or object blocking.
 * 0s are empty space; non-qualifying components stay as original color or become 0? But in examples, some original colors persist (e.g., 1s,2s,6s), while others are cleared to 0 or changed.
 * Subtle: Visibility checks treat bg and 0 as "transparent" (don't block), but any other color blocks; right-visible checks from right edge inward, but rarely used.
 * Shape "ok" logic is convoluted: Allows squares only if single cell and top-row or not right-visible; this may miss vertical stacks.
 * Bottom-touching for special 2: Threshold n-4 seems too loose (e.g., touches near-bottom rows); likely should be stricter (e.g., row >=n-2).
 * Flood-fill starts from seeds but immediately sets neighbors to 5 and queues them, leading to full spread; probably needs to be directional (e.g., downward/rightward only) or blocked by objects.
 * Grids vary in size; n=rows, m=cols; assume rectangular.
 * Expected outputs preserve some original colors (e.g., 1s as seeds, 2s unchanged unless special, 6s as blockers) and leave strategic 0s unfilled (e.g., holes or paths).
 * Easy to miss: Components must be fully connected; isolated pixels count as size=1; over-aggressive size limits skip valid multi-part objects; flood-fill visits 0s but shouldn't cross object boundaries or fill top/left visible areas.

These functions are helpful for component extraction (8-connected BFS), bbox/size calc, and visibility checks (treating 0/bg as transparent). They correctly identify isolated groups but need integration with stricter rules.

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
```python
def flood_fill_from_seeds(out: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Over-fills all adjacent 0s from {1,3,5} without directionality or blocking, setting to 5 indiscriminately.
    # It queues and spreads fully, but examples show selective filling (e.g., only "shadow" areas, leaving holes as 0).
    # Not helpful as-is; needs constraints like downward-only from objects or avoiding top/left visible paths.
    # Don't use without major fixes.
```
```python
def change_special_two_components(out: List[List[int]], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Broken: Only triggers if bg==8, changes bottom-touching 2s to 3, but threshold n-4 is arbitrary/wrong (e.g., Train1 expected keeps some 2s).
    # Also, in Train3 (bg=7), 2s are kept as-is in expected, but logic doesn't apply. Unhelpful without generalizing or fixing threshold.
```
The change_green/orange functions are partially helpful but have wrong size/shape thresholds (e.g., skip valid >4/6? No, but misapply visibility/shape_ok, leading to wrong changes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly extracts 8-connected components and checks visibility/bg exclusion, but fails all training due to over-changing (e.g., turns non-qualifying greens/oranges to 3/5 instead of 0) and buggy flood-fill.
 * Train1 (bg=8): Generated fills too many 0s with 5 (e.g., row3 col9=5 vs exp=0; row6 col2=5 vs exp=0), changes some 1s/5s incorrectly (but 1s should be seeds?); keeps 2s but exp clears some areas to 0 without filling; special 2 logic misfires (bottom 2s changed to 3? but exp keeps 2s); shape_ok allows wrong vertical stacks as 5.
 * Train2 (bg=9): Generated changes top 7s to nothing (stay 7? but exp=3), turns some 4s to 5 correctly but misses others (e.g., row1 col10=4->? exp=5, but row2 col11-12=6 stay 6 ok); over-applies 3 to wrong 3/7 spots (e.g., row1 col3-4=3 ok, but row2 col7-8=7 vs exp=3); flood-fill absent or weak, leaving no extra 5s where exp has them (e.g., row1 col10=5).
 * Train3 (bg=7): Generated changes some 6s/1s to 3 incorrectly (e.g., row1-2 col4-5=3 ok, but row4 col2=6->? exp=5; row8 col1-2=6->? gen keeps 6 vs exp=5); misses turning vertical 6s/1s to 5 (e.g., left column 6s stay 6, but exp=5 for some); special 2 not applied (correct, but bottom 2s stay 2 ok); no flood-fill evident, as exp has 5s in empty spots but gen lacks them.
 * Overall: Visibility checks work (top/left detect edges), but shape_ok too permissive (allows non-wide as 5/3 wrongly); size limits too strict/loose; flood-fill spreads everywhere, filling "visible" 0s that should stay 0 (e.g., holes behind objects); doesn't clear non-qualifying objects to 0 (keeps originals like 5/1 where exp=0).
 * extract_components is essential and correct for grouping; get_bbox_and_size useful for h/w; visibility funcs good but has_right_visible underused/misapplied in shape_ok.
 * change_green/orange apply changes but wrong conditions (e.g., Train1 changes isolated 5s? to 5 redundantly); don't handle 1 as seed (keep as-is?).
 * Missed: Selective 0-to-5 only in "shadows" (e.g., below/right of objects, not above/left); components of same color but disconnected treated separately (ok, but aggregate? No).
 * Unknown: Why Train1 exp has 0s in a "stem" under 2s (not filled), but gen fills to 5; possibly flood only from changed 3/5, not original 1/5.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows scattered 5s (e.g., row8-10 has 5s in middle, likely from orange change) and some flood-fill (e.g., row5 col22-23=1? Wait, output has 1s persisting, but flood from them?); however, large areas of 0-implied (not shown, but gen has 4 bg everywhere else) suggest under-filling, while visible 1s/9s aren't cleared/changed properly (e.g., top 1s should be green? but bg=4, 1 is green, top-visible, size? If small/wide, to 3, then flood below to 5, but gen keeps 1s and adds random 5s). It over-relies on existing 5s for flood (row8 col6-8=5, probably wrong change of ? color), missing expected 0s in paths/holes (e.g., row12 col7-8=1s stay, but exp likely 0 or 5 shadow). Doesn't account for large grid (30 cols?); components like horizontal 1s (row3 col5-12) should be wide green to 3, flooding below, but gen keeps 1s. Looks like partial visibility detection but no clearing to 0, leading to messy unchanged areas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 2D list of integers representing colored cells (with 0 as empty, a background color b, and various foreground colors), and the goal is to produce an output grid by recoloring connected components of foreground colors to 3 or 5 based on rules involving their color parity, position (e.g., near the top), visibility from top or left edges (unobstructed by other non-background non-empty cells), and special cases (e.g., for specific color-background pairs or bottom-touching), followed by flood-filling remaining empty (0) cells connected to "seed" colors {1,3,5} with color 5.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so extraction must consider all 8 directions to group adjacent same-color cells correctly.
 * Background b is always the top-left cell value; ignore it and 0s when collecting used colors or checking obstructions.
 * For odd foreground colors (c % 2 == 1, excluding b and special case c=1 when b=8): recolor entire component to 3 only if it's near the top (min row index <=3) AND fully top-visible (at least one cell in the component has no non-b non-0 cells above it in its column).
 * For even foreground colors (c % 2 == 0, excluding b, c=2, and special case c=6 when b=9): recolor entire component to 5 only if near the top (min row <=3) AND (top-visible OR left-visible, where left-visible means at least one cell has no non-b non-0 cells to its left in its row).
 * Special case for c=2 when b=8: recolor to 3 if the component touches near the bottom (max row >= n-3), regardless of other rules.
 * Flood-fill only affects 0s: start from all cells already colored 1,3, or 5 (seeds), and fill adjacent (8 directions) 0s with 5, propagating to connected empties—but do not overwrite existing non-0 cells, and ensure it's a proper BFS flood to handle disconnected empty regions (only those touching seeds get filled).
 * Subtlety: Visibility checks must scan strictly above/left in the column/row, stopping at any obstructing cell (non-b and >0); if any cell in component is visible, the whole component qualifies.
 * Easy to miss: Rules are applied in sequence (special first, then odds to 3, then evens to 5), but components are extracted from the original input grid, not the modified output, to avoid interference; also, used colors exclude b and 0.
 * Flood-fill must not fill isolated 0s not connected to seeds; in some cases, 0s remain if not reachable.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 18x18 for train1, 15x15 for train2, larger for test); rules like row thresholds (<=3 or >=n-3) are relative but fixed (top=3 rows, bottom=last 3 rows?).
 * No recoloring for certain pairs (e.g., skip c=1 if b=8 for odd rule; skip c=6 if b=9 for even rule), suggesting puzzle-specific exceptions to avoid over-recoloring.
 * Output keeps background and unchanged cells as-is, only modifies qualifying components and connected 0s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies background, used colors, and 8-connected components; extract_components is essential and works well for grouping.
 * Odd color rule partially works: in train3 (correct), it likely applied top-visible + near-top to color odds to 3 appropriately.
 * Even color rule has issues: in train1, it colored some evens to 5 where expected keeps 0s or originals (e.g., generated row3 col16=5 but expected 0; row4 col13=5 but expected 0), suggesting over-application or wrong visibility check.
 * Special c=2 b=8 rule works in train1: bottom 2's correctly to 3 (e.g., row14 col10-11=3 in both), but interacts badly with flood-fill, leading to extra 5's nearby.
 * In train2 (b=9), even rule skipped c=6 correctly (no recolor), but mismatches like row2 col13=5 generated vs 4 expected (possibly a 6 or 4 component miscolored; unknown why, as input not shown but output differs); also row3 col13=5 vs 4, row4 col14=5 vs 9? Wait, expected row4 col14=9? No, expected row3 col13=6? Wait, details fuzzy but clear recoloring error for evens/4/6.
 * Flood-fill is helpful but buggy: in train1, it over-fills 0s to 5 in areas not intended (e.g., row3 col14=5 vs expected 0; row5 col2=5 vs 0; row6 col2=0 expected but generated 5? Wait, generated row5 col2=5 vs expected 0), possibly because seeds include post-recolor 3/5, but queue init only fills direct adjacents initially, then propagates—yet misses some isolations or overreaches due to 8-dir.
 * touches_bottom is useful for special bottom rule but threshold n-3 may be too loose (touches last 3 rows?); works for train1 bottom.
 * Visibility functions are core but subtle bug: they return True if ANY cell in component is visible, which is correct per rules, but in train1, this may cause over-coloring if partial visibility triggers whole comp.
 * Overall, sequence of applying rules (special -> odds -> evens) is good, but exceptions like skipping c=1 b=8 and c=6 b=9 are incomplete—train2 fails suggest more specials needed (e.g., for 4?).
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though flood_fill needs fix for proper seed-adjacency without overfill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (on a ~30x30 grid with b=4, colors including 1,3,5,9) applies rules but over-fills with 5's extensively, e.g., large areas of original 3's and 1's remain but many 0's (implied in input) are 5, and some 9's stay—however, it does not look fully correct because odd colors like 1 and 3 should be checked for top-visibility and near-top to become 3, but generated keeps many 1's/3's unchanged (e.g., rows 2-3 full 3's stay 3, which might be correct if not visible, but row5 col6-7=4 stay? Wait, input has 4's as b); even 5's already present stay, but 9 (odd) in bottom areas like row5 col21-23=9 stay 9, possibly not near-top so no recolor—yet flood seems to have filled some but left others (e.g., row8 col20=1 stay, but adjacent 0's? to 5).
 * Mismatches likely: if input has near-top 1's (odd) with top-visible, they should become 3 but stay 1 in generated (e.g., row5 col2-3=1 stay); 9's (odd) near bottom stay 9 correctly (not near-top), but if any top-visible 9 near top, should be 3—generated doesn't change them, suggesting rule application missed some components.
 * Flood-fill appears to have worked partially (many 5's in empty areas connected to seeds like existing 5's in row8 col6-8), but if there are isolated 0's not touching 1/3/5 post-recolor, they should remain 0—generated seems to fill too much, similar to train1 overfill issue.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (respects b=4, doesn't touch bottom specials since no 2, keeps non-qualifying components), but likely incorrect due to under-recoloring odds (e.g., visible 1's/9's not to 3) and potential flood overreach; without expected, hard to confirm, but pattern suggests rules need tuning for larger grids or more color interactions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images of plant-like structures (e.g., trees or foliage) where the goal is to transform an input grid by recoloring components (connected groups of cells) based on positional rules, visibility from edges, and adjacency to "seeds" (certain colors like 1,3,5), ultimately filling empty spaces (0s) connected to valid structures. The background color (b) influences specific rules, such as treating certain colors as potential leaves (3) or stems (5), while ignoring or skipping others like 2 unless special conditions apply.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-way connected (including diagonals), so extraction must use all 8 directions to group cells correctly; 4-way would miss diagonal connections.
 * Background (b) is the color at [0][0] and is ignored in visibility checks; empty cells (0) are not background but potential fillable space.
 * Visibility from top: A component has top visibility if at least one of its cells has no non-background/non-empty cells above it in the same column.
 * Visibility from left: Similar, no non-background/non-empty cells to the left in the same row.
 * For odd colors (1,3,5,7,9 excluding b): Change to 3 (likely "leaves") if min row <=2 (top-positioned), top-visible, and either left-visible or at row 0; stricter for color 1 (requires both visibilities).
 * Stem colors depend on b: empty for b=4/8, 4 for b=9, 6 for b=7; these change to 5 (likely "stems") if min row <=4, top-visible, and not touching right edge.
 * Special rule for b=8 and color 2: Change entire component to 3 if it touches the bottom (max row >= n-3, suggesting near-bottom but not exact edge; this may be off by 1-2 rows).
 * Second pass: Remaining stem-colored components (after first pass) change to 5 if any cell is adjacent (8-way) to a seed {1,3,5}.
 * Final flood fill: All 0s connected (8-way) to any seed {1,3,5} become 5; this must start from 0s adjacent to seeds and propagate, but only after prior changes.
 * Subtleties: min_row checks are strict (e.g., >4 skips entirely); right-touch is any cell on rightmost column; flood fill uses visited to avoid revisiting but starts incorrectly (sets to 5 before queuing, but checks adjacency first); no handling for color 2 in general cases; odds like 7/9 may need looser left-vis rules; bottom-touch for 2s may need adjustment (e.g., >=n-2 or component spanning); adjacency for stems is per-cell but triggers whole component; 0s not connected to seeds stay 0 (important for open spaces); b=4/7/8/9 have varying stem_cs, but code misses some (e.g., no stem for b=4); components extracted on original g first, then out for second pass, but flood on final out.
 * Easy to miss: Flood fill queue starts only from adjacent 0s, but code has a bug—initial loop sets out[i][j]=5 and queues if adjacent, but visited is set, ok; however, it doesn't flood non-adjacent 0s correctly if chain; no reversal of changes; color 6 in train3 expected but not generated, suggesting missing stem handling or propagation for b=7; in train1, bottom 2s partially changed but not all in component; extra 5s in places that should be 0 (e.g., isolated or non-qualifying areas).

The flood fill in the main program is helpful but buggy in initialization (sets to 5 before full queuing; works but inefficient); uses deque for BFS.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly identifies background b and skips it/0s in color sets and visibility.
 * Correctly uses 8-way connectivity for components, which is essential for blob shapes like the 2s in train1 or 6s in train3.
 * First pass changes some top-left odds to 3 correctly in parts (e.g., train1 top 1s stay but should propagate; train2 top 3s stay 3).
 * Special rule for b=8 color 2 partially works: changes some bottom 2s to 3 (e.g., train1 row14 3,3) but misses others in same component (row13 2,2 stay 2 instead of expected 3,3; likely touches_bottom threshold wrong, as max i=14 < n-3=15 for n=18).
 * Stem handling for b=7/9 adds stem_cs={6}/{4} and changes some to 5 if top-vis/not right-touch, but misses propagation (train3 generates no 6s to 5 in places like row5 col12=6 expected, instead 5 elsewhere; train2 row3 col5=5 generated but expected 4, suggesting over-change).
 * Second pass adj to seeds changes some stems to 5 (helpful for propagation), but skips if not qualifying in first pass.
 * Flood fill correctly spreads 5 to connected 0s adj to {1,3,5} (8-way), but overfills in train1 (e.g., row3 col14=5 generated vs 0 expected; row6 col2=5 gen vs 0 exp; isolated 0s filled wrongly) and train2 (row4 col5=9 gen? Wait no, but mismatches like row3 col5=5 vs4).
 * Train1 mismatches: Extra 5s in right column (e.g., row3 col14=5 vs0, row3 col16=5 ok but row4 col13=5 vs0, row5 col2=5 vs0); bottom 2s not fully to 3 (row13 col11-12=2,2 vs3,3); flood overfills vertical 0s on right that aren't connected to valid seeds.
 * Train2 mismatches: Overchanges potential stems (row3 col5=5 vs4, row4 col6=5 vs4? Expected row4 [9,9,9,5,9,9,4,...] gen [9,9,9,5,9,9,5,...] so col6=5 vs4); bottom 3s in row13 col10-11=3,3 gen? But expected row13 [9,9,4,4,4,7,7,9,9,7,7,9,7,7,9] no 3s there, wait gen has issues elsewhere like row5 col1=4 ok but overall wrong placements for 4/6.
 * Train3 mismatches: No 6s generated at all (expected 6s in row5 col12, row6 col11-12/14, row7 col14, etc., as stems); instead over-relies on 5s (e.g., row5 col12=2? Wait gen row5 [7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,2,2,7,...] vs exp [7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,2,2,...] so col12=5 vs6, and misses later 6s like row10 col10=6 exp vs5 gen); bottom 2s stay 2 ok, but no stem propagation to 6 then 5.
 * extract_components is essential and correct for identifying blobs.
 * has_top_visible and has_left_visible are helpful and seem accurate for edge visibility.
 * touches_bottom is helpful but likely broken (threshold n-3 too strict; in train1 n=18, max i=14 for 2s should trigger but doesn't fully).
 * get_adjacent_seed is helpful for second pass and flood init.
 * Overall, first pass min_row/top-vis rules partially work for leaves (3) but too strict/loose for stems; no handling for color 6/4 as intermediates in b=7/9; flood overfills non-connected 0s.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-applies changes similar to training failures (e.g., many isolated 1s stay 1 but should perhaps propagate to 3/5 if qualifying; 3s at top-left stay 3 ok, but 9s in middle-right seem unchanged or partially to 5 wrongly, like row5 col21-23=9,9,9 gen vs likely need stem/leaf rules for b=4; flood to 5 in row8 col6-8=5,5,5 ok if adj to seeds, but row12 col13-15=9,9,9 stay vs possibly change; bottom row20-22 5,5,5 in col21-23 likely overfill if not connected; extra 5s in row8 col6-8 where input has ? but gen has them without clear seed adj; many 0s absent, replaced by 4s or 5s incorrectly, e.g., potential open spaces filled; for b=4 (no stem_cs), it skips stems but still changes odds to 3/5 wrongly (e.g., top 3s to ? stay, but 1s propagate poorly); looks like leaf changes partial but flood over-aggressive, missing that some 9s/1s are separate components not visible/adj. Make sure to account for b=4 having no stems (empty stem_cs correct, but odds overchanged) and larger grid needing efficient component extraction to handle 30x30 without missing large blobs like the right-side 1s/9s.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify connected components (blobs/objects) of specific colors in a background grid, evaluate their visibility from edges (top, left, right, bottom), and transform them to new colors (e.g., 3 or 5) based on shape ratios (width vs height), visibility conditions, and background-specific rules, before performing a flood fill from certain seed values (odd numbers like 1,3,5,7,9) to fill empty (0) spaces with 5, likely simulating some kind of object occlusion or rendering in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals) groups of the same non-background, non-zero value; empty spaces are 0.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0]; exclude bg from consideration for changes, and visibility checks ignore bg and 0.
 * For "green" colors (1,7,9 if not bg): Change to 3 if top-visible and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)).
 * For "orange" colors (4,6 if not bg): Change to 5 if (top or left visible) and (wider than tall OR (square-ish and not right-visible or at top row)); subtle: this seems to target horizontal-ish bars or protrusions.
 * Special case if bg==8: Change 2-components to 3 if bottom-visible (perhaps shadows or ground-level objects).
 * Flood fill: Starts from seeds {1,3,5,7,9}, spreads to adjacent 0s (8 directions) filling with 5, but only if not visited; subtle: this might simulate filling hidden/empty areas behind visible objects, but it can overfill if seeds are misplaced.
 * Visibility: A component is "top-visible" if any cell has no non-bg/non-0 above it in the same column; similar for left (same row left), right (same row right), bottom (below).
 * Subtleties: Changes use a dict to avoid overwriting; components must be non-empty; shape ratio uses bounding box (min/max i/j +1 for h/w); easy to miss: visibility is per-cell then any in component, and changes only if do_change condition met; flood fill uses BFS but seeds include post-change values, so order matters (changes before fill); bg can be colors like 4,8,9 affecting which are "greens/oranges"; no diagonal-only connections—full 8-way; potential over-changing if multiple rules overlap; empty grid areas stay bg unless filled.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle variable grid sizes; ensure copy_grid preserves original; visited prevents re-flood; but flood seeds include 5 which might self-propagate if adjacent to 0; rules seem asymmetric (favor horizontal changes, right/bottom less prioritized); test inputs may have no 0s initially, so fill only creates if changes introduce them? No—changes replace to 3/5, fill only targets existing 0s; subtle miss: expected outputs have 0s where generated has 5/3, suggesting changes should introduce 0s or not fill certain areas.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) passed Training example 3 (correct output matched), showing core component extraction, visibility, and flood fill work in some cases.
 * Failed Training 1: Generated filled areas with 5 and changed to 3 where expected has 0s and 2/5; specifically, upper blob (likely 2?) changed incorrectly to 3/5 instead of keeping/changing to 2 with 0s for hidden parts; flood fill over-applied 5 to what should be 0s; bottom 3s correct, but side 1s unchanged correctly; unknown why 2 not handled as special (bg=8 rule applied but wrong visibility?).
 * Failed Training 2: Generated kept some 5/3 but misplaced 4/6 vs expected (e.g., row 5 col 1-2: generated 5,5 expected 4,6; row 12 col 5: generated 4 expected 4 but surrounding mismatches); changes to 5/3 over-applied to vertical-ish components; flood fill didn't create 0s, but expected has no 0s—issue is wrong color swaps (e.g., 6s became 5?); bg=9, so greens=1,7 but input has 3,5,6,4,7—3 not changed, but oranges=4,6 changed wrong.
 * extract_components is essential and correct (used successfully in the correct example 3).
 * Visibility functions are helpful but subtle bug: they check per-cell but return if ANY visible, which is correct, but in train1, top_vis likely true but do_change wrong for vertical blobs.
 * Flood fill is mostly helpful but unhelpful in cases with no 0s (does nothing, correct) or overfills post-change seeds; in train1, it filled what should be 0s (perhaps changes didn't introduce 0s, but expected has them—suggests rule should set some to 0 instead of 3/5).
 * Changes dict avoids overlaps, helpful; greens/oranges filtering by !=bg is key but missed if bg in list (e.g., train2 bg=9 not in lists).
 * Overall: Partial rules for horizontal changes work (why example 3 passed), but vertical/square components not distinguished well; special bg=8 rule applied in train1 but wrong (changed 2 to 3, but expected kept 2 with 0s); no handling for keeping 0s or other colors like 2/5 unchanged.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have minimally changed the input (kept most 1,3,5,9 components as-is or swapped some 1/9 to 3 under rules), with no 0s introduced and flood fill doing nothing (since no 0s in input and changes don't create them), resulting in a grid full of 4(bg),1,3,5,9 without occlusions or empties.
 * Expected likely includes 0s in hidden areas (e.g., behind vertical 1s or 9s, similar to train1 where 0s represent occluded space), and possibly more changes to 5 for oranges (but bg=4, so oranges=6 only if present—input has none?); e.g., the large horizontal 3s in rows 2-3 stayed 3 (correct if not green), but vertical 9s in col 21-23 rows 5-20 probably should be partially 0 or changed if not top-visible; side 5s in row8 col6-8 stayed, but if left-visible and wide, should be 5? Wait, already 5; overall, lacks 0s where components overlap shadows, and flood fill missed because no seeds hit 0s—suggests rules need to set some component parts to 0 for depth/occlusion, not just color swap; unknown exact diffs without input grid, but output looks too "filled" vs expected sparse 0s in trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:17:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to transform a colored grid (with numbers representing colors, 0 for empty space, and a background color) by recoloring specific connected components based on their shape (height/width ratios), position (e.g., visibility from top/left, proximity to bottom), color parity (odd/even), and special cases tied to background color, then flood-filling adjacent empty spaces (0s) with a filler color (5) from seed colors (1,3,5) using 4-way connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is assumed to be the value at grid[0][0]; non-background, non-zero cells are treated as objects to process.
 * Connected components are extracted using 8-way connectivity for objects, but flood-fill uses 4-way for filling 0s.
 * Visibility checks: "Top visible" means at least one cell in the component has only background or 0 above it in the same column; "left visible" similar for the row to the left.
 * Shape-based rules: For odd colors (except special cases like c=1 with b=8), change to 3 if top-visible and width >= height. For even colors, change to 5 if width > height and top-visible, or height > width and left-visible, or square (h==w) with top-visible and near-top (min_i <=1).
 * Special cases: If b=8 and c=2 and component touches near-bottom (max_i >= n-3), change to 3. If b=9 and c=6, skip (no change). These seem puzzle-specific overrides.
 * Post-processing: After recoloring, flood-fill 0s adjacent (4-way) to seeds {1,3,5} with 5, but the provided code's flood-fill implementation has a bug—it marks visited but starts queueing from seeds' neighbors without initially queueing the seeds themselves, and it only processes 0s, potentially missing full propagation.
 * Subtleties: Components can be skipped or specially handled based on bg/c pairs; empty/zero cells are not part of components; flood-fill should propagate fully but only into 0s (not overwriting other colors); parity (odd/even) affects target color (3 for odd, 5 for even); near-bottom touch is arbitrary (n-3, not full bottom); square components need extra top-proximity check.
 * Easy-to-miss: 8-way for component extraction allows diagonal connections, which can merge shapes unexpectedly; flood-fill must be BFS to avoid missing areas; special cases are hardcoded and may not generalize; zeros inside components aren't filled during extraction but get filled later if adjacent to seeds.
 * All considerations: Process each non-bg color separately; copy grid to avoid mutating input; sort used colors but process in order; ensure no overwriting of non-0/non-bg during fill.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import collections

These functions are helpful for component extraction (8-way BFS), visibility checks (top/left clear paths), and bottom-touch detection. The flood-fill in the main program is partially helpful but buggy (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled Training example 3 (full match, demonstrating core component extraction, visibility, and flood-fill work in some cases), but failed Training 1 and 2.
 * In Training 1 (bg=8): Generated incorrectly changed some 2's to 3's too early (e.g., bottom-left 2's became 3's but expected to stay 2's or change differently; right-side 1's filled with 5's correctly but top-right 2's became 5's instead of staying 2's; flood-fill overfilled some 0's into 5's where expected 0's or other colors; bottom 3's correctly placed but surrounding 5's mismatched (e.g., row 14 col 8-9 expected 5's but generated 0's/2's). Special case for b=8 c=2 bottom-touch worked partially but not fully.
 * In Training 2 (bg=9): Generated skipped c=6 correctly (per special case) but overfilled with 5's in wrong places (e.g., row 5 col 1 expected 4 but got 5; row 6 col 0 expected 4 got 5; left column 5's propagated incorrectly into areas that should be 4's; bottom-right 7's and 4's mismatched, with extra 5's where expected 4's). Shape rules for even/odd didn't trigger correctly for components like 3's (odd, stayed 3 but some 4's became 5 incorrectly).
 * Flood-fill bug: Code enqueues neighbors of seeds but doesn't enqueue seeds initially for propagation, and visited is set before full BFS, leading to incomplete fills (e.g., in Train 1, some 0-chains not fully 5'd; in Train 2, isolated 0's missed).
 * Special cases helped Train 3 but were too narrow (e.g., b=9 c=6 skip worked, but didn't handle other evens like 4's properly).
 * extract_components is essential and correct (8-way works for merging diagonal objects); visibility functions are helpful but may miss if 0's block "clear" paths (treat 0 as clear, which seems right).
 * touches_bottom is helpful but arbitrary threshold (n-3); may need tuning for different grid sizes.
 * get_used_colors and copy_grid are basic but useful; directions lists are standard.
 * Overall, core element of component-based recoloring + flood-fill is understood, but rules for when/ how to recolor (esp. for evens, specials) are incomplete, leading to mismatches; flood-fill implementation is broken or not fully helpful (incomplete propagation).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=4, with colors 1,3,5,9) partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on training patterns—e.g., large horizontal 3's in rows 2-3 stay 3 (odd color, top-visible, w>h so should change to 3? Wait, already 3, but rules target change from original; unclear). Left 1's (odd) become 5's via flood? But expected might keep some 1's or change to 3 based on visibility/shape (e.g., vertical 1's left-visible, h>w so no change per even rule but odd rule applies differently). 9's (odd) in mid-right seem unchanged, but if top-visible and w<h (vertical), might expect change to 3; flood-fill with 5's around bottom 5's looks over-aggressive (e.g., row 18 col 21-23 expected 5's correct, but row 8 col 6-8 5's might be wrong if not seeded properly). Bottom 3's in col 25-26 stay 3 (correct for odd?), but surrounding 4's unchanged ok. Issues: No special cases triggered (no b=8/9), so defaults apply; flood-fill likely incomplete/buggy, missing some 0-fills (grid has no 0's shown, but output has none either—test input not provided, but assuming 0's exist, output seems to have filled some areas with 5's correctly but possibly overfilled vertical 1's into 5's where they should stay 1 or become 3. Doesn't fully match expected logic from trains (e.g., Train 1 had similar vertical odds staying 1 with partial 5 fill); explain why not correct: Shape/visibility misapplied for 9's (vertical, left-visible, but odd rule only for top_v and w>=h, which vertical h>w so no change—seems ok, but flood from 5's overwrote adjacent 1's/9's incorrectly since fill targets only 0's but code might leak). Account for larger grid (30x30?) needing scaled bottom-touch (n-3 too loose).
