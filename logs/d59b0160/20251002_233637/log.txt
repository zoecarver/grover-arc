=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 23:36:37] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 00:00:50] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def is_non_seven(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] != 7

def touches_top_or_bottom(component: List[tuple], n: int) -> bool:
    for x, y in component:
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
            return True
    return False

def flood_component(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[tuple]:
    component = []
    q = deque([(x, y)])
    visited[x][y] = True
    while q:
        cx, cy = q.popleft()
        component.append((cx, cy))
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_non_seven(nx, ny, g, n) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return component

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != 7 and not visited[i][j]:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 00:02:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where 7 represents barriers or walls, non-7 cells (0-6,8,9) represent open spaces, air, or labeled objects, and the task is to identify connected components of these non-7 cells using 4-way adjacency, then fill (set to 7) only those components that are fully enclosed—specifically, those not touching the top row (row 0) or bottom row (row n-1)—effectively removing "trapped" or floating regions while preserving components connected to the top or bottom (possibly simulating exposure to air or ground).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connectivity is strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only through non-7 cells; diagonal does not count.
 * Components are groups of adjacent non-7 cells; all non-7 values (including numbers 1-9 and 0s) are treated as connectable in the current approach, but this may be a subtlety—numbers 1-9 might represent solid "objects" that should block connectivity for air (0s only) or require special handling to preserve their positions and surrounding 0s if the object touches the bottom.
 * Filling only occurs for components not touching top or bottom rows; components touching either are preserved entirely (including their internal structure of 0s and numbers), which suggests a "grounded" or "exposed" rule where bottom-touching structures (e.g., cave formations or lakes) stay intact.
 * Subtle element: The puzzle likely preserves complex structures (e.g., "islands" or "pockets" with embedded numbers surrounded by 0s) if they touch the bottom, but the current flood fill merges separate structures incorrectly if they are connected through non-7 paths that shouldn't be (e.g., treating numbers as passable air).
 * Easy to miss: Not all enclosed areas are filled—only truly trapped ones; side-touching but bottom-touching components must be preserved, and the program may overfill by not distinguishing between air (0s) and objects (1-9). In expected outputs, preserved areas often have intricate patterns of 0s around numbers, suggesting objects define boundaries rather than being filled themselves.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, reflection, or value modification beyond filling to 7; grid size n=16 in examples; 7s are immutable barriers that block all connectivity and filling.
 * Potential misinterpretation: This isn't simple border flooding (e.g., from all sides); the top/bottom check implies vertical exposure (e.g., air from top, ground from bottom), not full perimeter. Numbers 1-9 are preserved in place in expected outputs, so filling shouldn't overwrite them unless the entire component is trapped.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program includes useful building blocks for component detection and filling, which align with core flood-fill logic.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def is_non_seven(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] != 7
```
(This bounds-checks and identifies traversable non-7 cells; helpful for any connectivity-based approach.)

```python
def touches_top_or_bottom(component: List[tuple], n: int) -> bool:
    for x, y in component:
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
            return True
    return False
```
(This correctly identifies exposure to top/bottom; essential for the enclosure rule, though may need extension to preserve side/bottom structures.)

```python
def flood_component(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[tuple]:
    component = []
    q = deque([(x, y)])
    visited[x][y] = True
    while q:
        cx, cy = q.popleft()
        component.append((cx, cy))
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_non_seven(nx, ny, g, n) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return component
```
(This performs accurate 4-way BFS flood fill to extract components; very helpful and not broken—reuse it, but consider modifying is_non_seven to only traverse 0s if numbers are solid.)

The main program function integrates these well for iteration and filling but over-applies filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly solved training example 1 by properly identifying and filling enclosed non-7 components not touching top/bottom, preserving exposed ones.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated overfilled the grid, turning most middle and left-bottom areas to 7s (e.g., rows 1-10 mostly 7s except top-left 3s/5/6, and only a small bottom-right pocket with 0s/6/5/1/9 preserved), while expected preserves two separate structures—a middle-right pocket (rows 1-7, cols 6-15 with 0s/1/0/5/2/6/8/9) and a bottom-left pocket (rows 9-14, cols 1-8 with 0s/1/5/9/8/2/4)—likely because they touch bottom/sides but were incorrectly merged or deemed non-touching top/bottom.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated overfilled similarly, preserving only top-left (3s/6/8) and a tiny bottom-right strip (0s in col 14-15, rows 12-15), while expected preserves top-left plus a large middle-left structure (rows 5-14, cols 1-9 with 0s/5/2/1/9/6/8) and bottom-right 0s; difference is unknown but likely due to incorrect connectivity through numbers, filling bottom-touching components that should stay (e.g., expected keeps row 5-9 left with 0s/5/2/1).
 * Core issue across failures: Treats all non-7 (including 1-9) as connectable air, leading to over-merging and over-filling of preserved structures; expected outputs keep embedded numbers and surrounding 0s in bottom-touching "objects" intact, suggesting numbers may act as barriers for air fill or define preservable blobs.
 * touches_top_or_bottom is helpful but insufficient alone—may need to check bottom-only touching for preservation, or flood from bottom border to mark reachable areas instead of component-based filling.
 * No unhelpful functions here; all provided (is_non_seven, flood_component, touches_top_or_bottom) are relevant and functional, though is_non_seven may need tweaking to exclude 1-9 if they are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially resembles the incorrect training 2/3 patterns: It preserves top-left structure (rows 0-4, cols 0-5 with 2/5/4/3s and some 0s/6/1) and a large bottom-right/middle area (rows 5-15, cols 6-15 with scattered 0s/8/5/2/4/1/9), but fills middle areas with 7s (e.g., row 5 cols 0-5 has 9/0 then 7s).
 * It does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfilling seen in failed trainings (e.g., likely merged or incorrectly filled bottom-left/middle components that should be preserved like in training 2/3 expecteds, where multiple bottom-touching pockets with 0s around numbers remain); for instance, the test has isolated 9/0/8 in row 6-7 left, but if similar to trainings, this might be an overfilled "object" that should connect to a larger preserved structure touching bottom—unknown exact reason, but the sparse preservation suggests same connectivity error, leaving too few complex pockets.

[2025-10-03 00:02:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 00:52:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a 16x16 grid-based logic puzzle where input grids contain 0s (empty cells), 7s (pre-filled cells, likely representing "sea" or "exterior" filler), and scattered numbers (1-6, 8, 9 as fixed clues). The goal is to fill certain 0s with 7s based on connectivity rules to determine "exterior" or fillable regions, while leaving other 0s unfilled (likely interior or clue-related regions) and preserving all clue numbers unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s connected via other 0s to any border (top, bottom, left, right) should generally be filled with 7s, treating border 7s as starting points for propagation, but not all border-adjacent 0s are filled (e.g., some interior-touching border 0s remain 0 in expected outputs, suggesting over-simple flood fill overfills).
 * Propagation only through 0s (not through numbers or existing 7s beyond seeding), but seeding must include all four borders; missing bottom/right seeding leads to underfilling in enclosed-but-exterior-connected areas.
 * Clue numbers (1-6, 8, 9) must never be changed to 7; they remain fixed regardless of adjacency to 7s, indicating they define or protect interior regions (e.g., possible island clues in a Nurikabe-like puzzle where 7 is sea and 0s are island spaces).
 * Some interior regions of 0s and numbers are completely filled to 7s in expected outputs (e.g., no remaining 0s or numbers in certain blocks), suggesting rules for identifying "degenerate" or non-protected regions that get fully filled, possibly if they violate enclosure or size rules.
 * Remaining 0s form connected clusters often adjacent to or containing clue numbers, implying 0s in "protected" interior regions (enclosed by 7s) stay unfilled, potentially with subtle rules like no 2x2 0-blocks or region sizes matching clues (e.g., a "1" clue might protect a single adjacent 0 or itself).
 * Existing 7s act as barriers but also as seeds for filling adjacent 0s; interior 7s do not propagate filling unless connected via the flood (but current code doesn't seed interior 7s).
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s aren't always filled (e.g., train2 row1 0s remain 0 despite top-border proximity), so connectivity must consider enclosures created by numbers/7s; overflooding happens if ignoring that some 0s are "internal" even near borders.
 * No diagonal connectivity (only orthogonal, as in code's dirs); all changes are iterative but single-pass flood suffices if seeded correctly.
 * Across attempts, no handling for clue-based filling (e.g., expanding regions from numbers) or validation rules (e.g., ensuring no touching interiors), leading to mismatches in both over- and under-filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `fill_exterior_0s` function is partially helpful as a flood-fill base for exterior 0s but broken (incomplete border seeding leads to underfilling; fix by adding bottom/right border seeding loops similar to top/left). It correctly propagates only through 0s and preserves non-0s.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = 16
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # Start from all four borders: cells that are 0 or 7
    # Top
    for c in range(n):
        if h[0][c] == 0 or h[0][c] == 7:
            q.append((0, c))
            visited[0][c] = True
    # Bottom
    for c in range(n):
        if h[n-1][c] == 0 or h[n-1][c] == 7:
            if not visited[n-1][c]:
                q.append((n-1, c))
                visited[n-1][c] = True
    # Left (skip corners if already visited)
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][0] == 0 or h[r][0] == 7:
            if not visited[r][0]:
                q.append((r, 0))
                visited[r][0] = True
    # Right
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][n-1] == 0 or h[r][n-1] == 7:
            if not visited[r][n-1]:
                q.append((r, n-1))
                visited[r][n-1] = True
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while q:
        r, c = q.popleft()
        if h[r][c] == 0:
            h[r][c] = 7
        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and h[nr][nc] == 0:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                q.append((nr, nc))
    return h
```

No other helpful functions from the attempt; no types or object-extraction tools were used or needed yet (e.g., no need for extracting regions around clues).

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
The `fill_isolated_non7` function is broken and irrelevant: it incorrectly changes fixed clue numbers (non-0 non-7) to 7 based on >=3 adjacent 7s, but expected outputs preserve all clues unchanged. It also doesn't affect 0s and runs in a loop that may over-apply, leading to invalid changes (e.g., in train1 row12, it left some clues but expected filled areas to 7 without changing clues elsewhere). Do not use in future attempts.

```python
def fill_isolated_non7(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:  # Broken: changes clues, ignores 0s, not puzzle-relevant
    # ... (code as provided, but discard)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incomplete flood fill (only top/left borders seeded, causing underfilling of 0s connected via bottom/right, e.g., train1 row6 left as [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,5,7,...] vs. expected all 7s; train3 row12-15 similar underfill of 0s).
 * Overfilling in non-enclosed areas: e.g., train2 row1 0s filled to 7s ([7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,...] generated vs. expected [7,7,7,3,7,7,0,0,0,7,...] with 0s preserved), suggesting border 0s aren't always exterior if part of interior structures.
 * Clue preservation failed indirectly: `fill_isolated_non7` didn't change most clues but was applied after flood, leaving mismatches where entire regions should be 7-filled without altering clues (e.g., train1 row7 generated [7,7,7,0,0,9,0,2,9,0,0,7,...] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,...], where 0s/clues stayed but should have been filled around/nearby).
 * Train1: Underfilled interior 0s (row6, row7 partial, row12 start [9,5,...] vs. expected 7s); overfilled nothing obvious but last two 0s correctly preserved in row7/8.
 * Train2: Severe overfilling of upper 0s (rows1-6 all mostly 7s generated vs. expected with 0-clusters and embedded clues like 1,5,2,6,9,8); lower 0s underfilled due to no right-border seed (row11-13 0s at end left vs. expected preserved as interior).
 * Train3: Underfilled lower 0s (rows12-15 [...,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] patterns vs. expected with some 7-fills but preserved 0-clusters around clues like 9,8,6,1,2); top overfilled slightly (row2 [7,7,8,3,...] but expected [7,7,8,3,...] similar, minor diff in row0 [7,7,7,3,...] vs. [7,6,7,3,...] unknown why 5->7? Wait, likely input diff but code filled adjacent 0s wrong).
 * No extraction of objects/regions (e.g., no function to identify clue-connected 0-clusters), missing for handling interior protections.
 * `fill_isolated_non7` caused no visible changes in most cases (clues had <3 adj 7s post-flood) but is conceptually wrong; remove it.
 * Overall, no handling for why some 0-clusters remain (e.g., enclosure by 7s/numbers) or clue implications (e.g., numbers protecting adjacent 0s from filling).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills some border-adjacent 0s (e.g., row5 [9,0,7,...] likely filled 0 to 7 incorrectly if that 0 is interior-protected like train2) and underfills lower/middle 0-clusters (e.g., rows7-15 have many unfilled 0s around clues like 2,4,1,9,5,6,8, but expected likely preserves some as interior while filling others to 7 based on connectivity/enclosure).
 * Specifically, row6 generated all 7s except scattered, but test input has 0s in row5 col10-15 [9,0,0,0,0,0], likely underfilled due to missing right-border seed (should connect via right if exterior).
 * Middle areas (rows7-9 cols3-15) have 0s preserved around clues (e.g., 2,4,0s), but if connected to bottom/right, they should be 7s per partial rules, yet code leaves them 0—mismatch similar to train1 underfill.
 * Lower rows (12-15) have 0s at ends (e.g., row12 col15=0, row13 col9=1 but adjacent 0s), looking like unfilled interiors, but without full borders seeded, it ignores potential exterior paths; also no clue changes, which is good, but overall too many 0s remain compared to expected patterns in training (e.g., train2 preserves 0-clusters but fills disconnected ones).
 * Does not account for protected 0s near borders (like train2 row1), leading to potential overfill in test's upper 0s (row5-6); unknown if test has enclosed regions with multiple clues (like train2 lower left), but code would fill them wrong without region extraction.

No other helpful functions from the attempt; no types or object-extraction tools were used or needed yet (e.g., no need for extracting regions around clues).

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
The `fill_isolated_non7` function is broken and irrelevant: it incorrectly changes fixed clue numbers (non-0 non-7) to 7 based on >=3 adjacent 7s, but expected outputs preserve all clues unchanged. It also doesn't affect 0s and runs in a loop that may over-apply, leading to invalid changes (e.g., in train1 row12, it left some clues but expected filled areas to 7 without changing clues elsewhere). Do not use in future attempts.

```python
def fill_isolated_non7(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:  # Broken: changes clues, ignores 0s, not puzzle-relevant
    # ... (code as provided, but discard)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incomplete flood fill (only top/left borders seeded, causing underfilling of 0s connected via bottom/right, e.g., train1 row6 left as [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,5,7,...] vs. expected all 7s; train3 row12-15 similar underfill of 0s).
 * Overfilling in non-enclosed areas: e.g., train2 row1 0s filled to 7s ([7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,...] generated vs. expected [7,7,7,3,7,7,0,0,0,7,...] with 0s preserved), suggesting border 0s aren't always exterior if part of interior structures.
 * Clue preservation failed indirectly: `fill_isolated_non7` didn't change most clues but was applied after flood, leaving mismatches where entire regions should be 7-filled without altering clues (e.g., train1 row7 generated [7,7,7,0,0,9,0,2,9,0,0,7,...] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,...], where 0s/clues stayed but should have been filled around/nearby).
 * Train1: Underfilled interior 0s (row6, row7 partial, row12 start [9,5,...] vs. expected 7s); overfilled nothing obvious but last two 0s correctly preserved in row7/8.
 * Train2: Severe overfilling of upper 0s (rows1-6 all mostly 7s generated vs. expected with 0-clusters and embedded clues like 1,5,2,6,9,8); lower 0s underfilled due to no right-border seed (row11-13 0s at end left vs. expected preserved as interior).
 * Train3: Underfilled lower 0s (rows12-15 [...,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] patterns vs. expected with some 7-fills but preserved 0-clusters around clues like 9,8,6,1,2); top overfilled slightly (row2 [7,7,8,3,...] but expected [7,7,8,3,...] similar, minor diff in row0 [7,7,7,3,...] vs. [7,6,7,3,...] unknown why 5->7? Wait, likely input diff but code filled adjacent 0s wrong).
 * No extraction of objects/regions (e.g., no function to identify clue-connected 0-clusters), missing for handling interior protections.
 * `fill_isolated_non7` caused no visible changes in most cases (clues had <3 adj 7s post-flood) but is conceptually wrong; remove it.
 * Overall, no handling for why some 0-clusters remain (e.g., enclosure by 7s/numbers) or clue implications (e.g., numbers protecting adjacent 0s from filling).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills some border-adjacent 0s (e.g., row5 [9,0,7,...] likely filled 0 to 7 incorrectly if that 0 is interior-protected like train2) and underfills lower/middle 0-clusters (e.g., rows7-15 have many unfilled 0s around clues like 2,4,1,9,5,6,8, but expected likely preserves some as interior while filling others to 7 based on connectivity/enclosure).
 * Specifically, row6 generated all 7s except scattered, but test input has 0s in row5 col10-15 [9,0,0,0,0,0], likely underfilled due to missing right-border seed (should connect via right if exterior).
 * Middle areas (rows7-9 cols3-15) have 0s preserved around clues (e.g., 2,4,0s), but if connected to bottom/right, they should be 7s per partial rules, yet code leaves them 0—mismatch similar to train1 underfill.
 * Lower rows (12-15) have 0s at ends (e.g., row12 col15=0, row13 col9=1 but adjacent 0s), looking like unfilled interiors, but without full borders seeded, it ignores potential exterior paths; also no clue changes, which is good, but overall too many 0s remain compared to expected patterns in training (e.g., train2 preserves 0-clusters but fills disconnected ones).
 * Does not account for protected 0s near borders (like train2 row1), leading to potential overfill in test's upper 0s (row5-6); unknown if test has enclosed regions with multiple clues (like train2 lower left), but code would fill them wrong without region extraction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where 7 represents barriers or walls, non-7 cells (0-6,8,9) represent open spaces, air, or labeled objects, and the task is to identify connected components of these non-7 cells using 4-way adjacency, then fill (set to 7) only those components that are fully enclosed—specifically, those not touching the top row (row 0) or bottom row (row n-1)—effectively removing "trapped" or floating regions while preserving components connected to the top or bottom (possibly simulating exposure to air or ground).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connectivity is strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only through non-7 cells; diagonal does not count.
 * Components are groups of adjacent non-7 cells; all non-7 values (including numbers 1-9 and 0s) are treated as connectable in the current approach, but this may be a subtlety—numbers 1-9 might represent solid "objects" that should block connectivity for air (0s only) or require special handling to preserve their positions and surrounding 0s if the object touches the bottom.
 * Filling only occurs for components not touching top or bottom rows; components touching either are preserved entirely (including their internal structure of 0s and numbers), which suggests a "grounded" or "exposed" rule where bottom-touching structures (e.g., cave formations or lakes) stay intact.
 * Subtle element: The puzzle likely preserves complex structures (e.g., "islands" or "pockets" with embedded numbers surrounded by 0s) if they touch the bottom, but the current flood fill merges separate structures incorrectly if they are connected through non-7 paths that shouldn't be (e.g., treating numbers as passable air).
 * Easy to miss: Not all enclosed areas are filled—only truly trapped ones; side-touching but bottom-touching components must be preserved, and the program may overfill by not distinguishing between air (0s) and objects (1-9). In expected outputs, preserved areas often have intricate patterns of 0s around numbers, suggesting objects define boundaries rather than being filled themselves.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, reflection, or value modification beyond filling to 7; grid size n=16 in examples; 7s are immutable barriers that block all connectivity and filling.
 * Potential misinterpretation: This isn't simple border flooding (e.g., from all sides); the top/bottom check implies vertical exposure (e.g., air from top, ground from bottom), not full perimeter. Numbers 1-9 are preserved in place in expected outputs, so filling shouldn't overwrite them unless the entire component is trapped.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program includes useful building blocks for component detection and filling, which align with core flood-fill logic.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def is_non_seven(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] != 7
```
(This bounds-checks and identifies traversable non-7 cells; helpful for any connectivity-based approach.)

```python
def touches_top_or_bottom(component: List[tuple], n: int) -> bool:
    for x, y in component:
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
            return True
    return False
```
(This correctly identifies exposure to top/bottom; essential for the enclosure rule, though may need extension to preserve side/bottom structures.)

```python
def flood_component(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[tuple]:
    component = []
    q = deque([(x, y)])
    visited[x][y] = True
    while q:
        cx, cy = q.popleft()
        component.append((cx, cy))
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_non_seven(nx, ny, g, n) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return component
```
(This performs accurate 4-way BFS flood fill to extract components; very helpful and not broken—reuse it, but consider modifying is_non_seven to only traverse 0s if numbers are solid.)

The main program function integrates these well for iteration and filling but over-applies filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly solved training example 1 by properly identifying and filling enclosed non-7 components not touching top/bottom, preserving exposed ones.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated overfilled the grid, turning most middle and left-bottom areas to 7s (e.g., rows 1-10 mostly 7s except top-left 3s/5/6, and only a small bottom-right pocket with 0s/6/5/1/9 preserved), while expected preserves two separate structures—a middle-right pocket (rows 1-7, cols 6-15 with 0s/1/0/5/2/6/8/9) and a bottom-left pocket (rows 9-14, cols 1-8 with 0s/1/5/9/8/2/4)—likely because they touch bottom/sides but were incorrectly merged or deemed non-touching top/bottom.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated overfilled similarly, preserving only top-left (3s/6/8) and a tiny bottom-right strip (0s in col 14-15, rows 12-15), while expected preserves top-left plus a large middle-left structure (rows 5-14, cols 1-9 with 0s/5/2/1/9/6/8) and bottom-right 0s; difference is unknown but likely due to incorrect connectivity through numbers, filling bottom-touching components that should stay (e.g., expected keeps row 5-9 left with 0s/5/2/1).
 * Core issue across failures: Treats all non-7 (including 1-9) as connectable air, leading to over-merging and over-filling of preserved structures; expected outputs keep embedded numbers and surrounding 0s in bottom-touching "objects" intact, suggesting numbers may act as barriers for air fill or define preservable blobs.
 * touches_top_or_bottom is helpful but insufficient alone—may need to check bottom-only touching for preservation, or flood from bottom border to mark reachable areas instead of component-based filling.
 * No unhelpful functions here; all provided (is_non_seven, flood_component, touches_top_or_bottom) are relevant and functional, though is_non_seven may need tweaking to exclude 1-9 if they are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially resembles the incorrect training 2/3 patterns: It preserves top-left structure (rows 0-4, cols 0-5 with 2/5/4/3s and some 0s/6/1) and a large bottom-right/middle area (rows 5-15, cols 6-15 with scattered 0s/8/5/2/4/1/9), but fills middle areas with 7s (e.g., row 5 cols 0-5 has 9/0 then 7s).
 * It does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfilling seen in failed trainings (e.g., likely merged or incorrectly filled bottom-left/middle components that should be preserved like in training 2/3 expecteds, where multiple bottom-touching pockets with 0s around numbers remain); for instance, the test has isolated 9/0/8 in row 6-7 left, but if similar to trainings, this might be an overfilled "object" that should connect to a larger preserved structure touching bottom—unknown exact reason, but the sparse preservation suggests same connectivity error, leaving too few complex pockets.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 01:12:35] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 16x16 grid containing 0s (empty/unfilled cells), 7s (background or wall cells), and numbers 1-9 (likely clues, objects, or barriers). The goal is to produce an output grid by filling certain 0s with 7s to distinguish exterior/unbounded regions from internal enclosed regions, while preserving numbers 1-9 and existing 7s unchanged; internal 0 regions that are fully enclosed (not connected to the border) should remain 0, forming shapes or "rooms" around or between numbered clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s represent traversable empty space for flooding/propagation, but only those connected to the grid border should be filled with 7 (exterior region); disconnected internal 0 clusters must remain 0 to match enclosed areas in expected outputs.
 * Numbers 1-9 act as barriers: the flood cannot pass through or over them (they block adjacency for 0-paths), and they remain unchanged in the output.
 * 7s are pre-filled background/walls: they block flooding (cannot traverse them) but may influence starting points for the fill.
 * Subtlety: Defining "connected to border" is critical and tricky—simple adjacency via 0-paths to border 0s may miss regions adjacent only to border 7s or border numbers; conversely, over-seeding from border 7s can incorrectly fill internal regions by treating border-adjacent 0s as exterior even if isolated internally.
 * The grid borders themselves may contain 0s, 7s, or numbers, complicating seeding: if a border cell is a number, adjacent internal 0s might need filling if considered exterior, but this risks over-filling.
 * No diagonal movement: flooding uses 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).
 * Multiple disconnected 0 regions exist; only the one touching the border gets filled—internal ones stay 0, often forming blob-like shapes in expected outputs (e.g., surrounding numbers without touching borders).
 * Potential for 2x2 or larger empty internal areas that must remain 0; over-filling these violates the enclosure rule.
 * The puzzle may involve implicit rules like no touching islands or connected sea, but based on outputs, the core is exterior vs. interior 0 regions.
 * Visually, expected outputs show 0s clustering into enclosed "pockets" (e.g., around numbers in ex2 upper grid, or linear paths in ex1 lower grid), suggesting the fill must precisely avoid crossing number barriers.
 * Copying the grid is essential to avoid mutating the input.
 * Visited tracking prevents revisiting and ensures efficient BFS/DFS flooding.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for safe grid duplication before modification.)

```python
def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # (Current seeding logic, but flawed: starts from border 0 or 7)
    # ... (rest of BFS as in attempt)
    return h
```
(This BFS flood-fill structure is helpful and core to the problem, as it correctly handles 4-dir propagation through 0s and visited tracking; it just needs seeding and enqueue conditions fixed to properly distinguish exterior from interior. Use DFS as alternative if needed for recursion.)

(No other functions like object extraction are present or needed; the problem doesn't require identifying or counting objects around numbers—it's purely about regional filling of 0s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses a BFS flood-fill starting from all border cells that are 0 or 7, propagating only through unvisited 0s and setting them to 7; this partially understands the exterior-filling concept but fails consistently due to incorrect seeding, leading to under-filling in some cases and over-filling in others.
 * In training example 1: Generated under-filled (left 0s remaining) in row 6 (cols 3-6 and 9-10 as 0,0,0,0 and 0,0) and mismatched lower regions (e.g., row 7 has 0s at cols 3-6,9-10,13 but expected has all 7s in row 6 and specific 0s only in lower rows like row 7 cols 14-15, row 9 cols 14-15, row 10 col 15, row 11 cols 8-11,13-15, etc.); upper rows 0-5 mostly match, but the fill didn't reach some exterior 0s (possibly due to number barriers or seeding missing border numbers), while incorrectly leaving internal-adjacent 0s unfilled when expected treats them as exterior.
 * In training example 2: Generated over-filled massively (e.g., row 1 all 7s except numbers, but expected has 0s at cols 6-8 and 12-14; row 2 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols 7-8,13,15? Wait, col15 is 4 in expected? Actually cols 7-8=0,0 and col13=0? No, expected row2: 0s at 6? Wait, [5,7,6,3,7,7,1,0,0,7,7,7,6,0,4,7] so 0s at cols7-8,13; generated has all 7s there), turning most internal 0 clusters to 7 when expected preserves them as enclosed regions (e.g., 0s forming shapes around numbers in rows 1-7 and separate pockets in rows 9-14); this suggests seeding from border 7s incorrectly treated internal components adjacent to background as exterior.
 * In training example 3: Generated over-filled internal areas (e.g., row 5 all 7s except some numbers like 5,9,5 but expected has 0s at cols1-5; row 7 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols1-2? Wait, expected row6: [7,0,0,0,0,0,7,...] so 0s cols1-5, but generated row6? Wait, rows are 0-indexed, generated row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,9,7,5,7] filled to 7s where expected has 0s; lower rows like 9-15 have some 0s filled differently, e.g., row9 generated has 0s at cols9-12 but expected has more structured 0s in cols1-3,4-5?); upper rows 0-3 mostly match, but fill invaded enclosed 0 pockets (e.g., row6-9 expected 0 clusters around numbers, but generated filled them).
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates understanding of BFS for regional filling and barrier handling (numbers/7s not traversed), but misses subtle seeding: including border 7s causes over-filling of near-border internals in ex2/ex3, while failing to fill some exterior 0s in ex1 (possibly because those 0s are only adjacent to border numbers, not enqueued); no object extraction needed, as numbers stay fixed—no counting holes or blobs required.
 * The copy_grid function works correctly and should be retained; fill_exterior_0s is mostly helpful but broken in seeding/enqueue logic (don't use as-is; modify to experiment with seeding only border 0s or all border cells).
 * No unhelpful functions present, but the current enqueue condition (only if h[nr][nc] == 0) is correct—don't change that; the issue is solely in initial queue population.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples; it over-fills some internal 0s (e.g., row 5 has isolated 0 at col1? Wait, row5: [9,0,7,7,...] leaves one 0 but fills around it, while expected likely wants enclosed clusters like in ex3 row5; row6: [7,8,7,0,0,7,...] leaves 0s at cols3-4 but fills others, potentially invading what should be internal pockets similar to ex2's preserved 0 shapes).
 * It under-fills or mismatches in lower rows (e.g., row12: [5,7,7,5,0,7,...] leaves scattered 0s, but training patterns suggest more structured enclosed 0s or full filling of exterior chains); overall, it resembles the over-filling in ex2/ex3 (many 7s with sparse 0s) rather than balanced exterior-only fill, so it likely incorrectly treats some internal regions as exterior due to seeding flaws—e.g., 0s in rows 6-9 cols3-4 seem like a small pocket that might should remain if enclosed, but without exact expected, it doesn't match the "enclosed blobs" subtlety seen in training.

[2025-10-03 01:12:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 16x16 grid containing 0s (empty/unfilled cells), 7s (background or wall cells), and numbers 1-9 (likely clues, objects, or barriers).

 * Visited tracking prevents revisiting and ensures efficient BFS/DFS flooding.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

```
(This is useful for safe grid duplication before modification.)

```python
def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # (Current seeding logic, but flawed: starts from border 0 or 7)
    # ... (rest of BFS as in attempt)
    return h
```

Wait, [5,7,6,3,7,7,1,0,0,7,7,7,6,0,4,7] so 0s at cols7-8,13; generated has all 7s there), turning most internal 0 clusters to 7 when expected preserves them as enclosed regions (e.g., 0s forming shapes around numbers in rows 1-7 and separate pockets in rows 9-14); this suggests seeding from border 7s incorrectly treated internal components adjacent to background as exterior.

 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates understanding of BFS for regional filling and barrier handling (numbers/7s not traversed), but misses subtle seeding: including border 7s causes over-filling of near-border internals in ex2/ex3, while failing to fill some exterior 0s in ex1 (possibly because those 0s are only adjacent to border numbers, not enqueued); no object extraction needed, as numbers stay fixed—no counting holes or blobs required.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples; it over-fills some internal 0s (e.g., row 5 has isolated 0 at col1? Wait, row5: [9,0,7,7,...] leaves one 0 but fills around it, while expected likely wants enclosed clusters like in ex3 row5; row6: [7,8,7,0,0,7,...] leaves 0s at cols3-4 but fills others, potentially invading what should be internal pockets similar to ex2's preserved 0 shapes).
 * It under-fills or mismatches in lower rows (e.g., row12: [5,7,7,5,0,7,...] leaves scattered 0s, but training patterns suggest more structured enclosed 0s or full filling of exterior chains); overall, it resembles the over-filling in ex2/ex3 (many 7s with sparse 0s) rather than balanced exterior-only fill, so it likely incorrectly treats some internal regions as exterior due to seeding flaws—e.g., 0s in rows 6-9 cols3-4 seem like a small pocket that might should remain if enclosed, but without exact expected, it doesn't match the "enclosed blobs" subtlety seen in training.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a 16x16 grid-based logic puzzle where input grids contain 0s (empty cells), 7s (pre-filled cells, likely representing "sea" or "exterior" filler), and scattered numbers (1-6, 8, 9 as fixed clues). The goal is to fill certain 0s with 7s based on connectivity rules to determine "exterior" or fillable regions, while leaving other 0s unfilled (likely interior or clue-related regions) and preserving all clue numbers unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s connected via other 0s to any border (top, bottom, left, right) should generally be filled with 7s, treating border 7s as starting points for propagation, but not all border-adjacent 0s are filled (e.g., some interior-touching border 0s remain 0 in expected outputs, suggesting over-simple flood fill overfills).
 * Propagation only through 0s (not through numbers or existing 7s beyond seeding), but seeding must include all four borders; missing bottom/right seeding leads to underfilling in enclosed-but-exterior-connected areas.
 * Clue numbers (1-6, 8, 9) must never be changed to 7; they remain fixed regardless of adjacency to 7s, indicating they define or protect interior regions (e.g., possible island clues in a Nurikabe-like puzzle where 7 is sea and 0s are island spaces).
 * Some interior regions of 0s and numbers are completely filled to 7s in expected outputs (e.g., no remaining 0s or numbers in certain blocks), suggesting rules for identifying "degenerate" or non-protected regions that get fully filled, possibly if they violate enclosure or size rules.
 * Remaining 0s form connected clusters often adjacent to or containing clue numbers, implying 0s in "protected" interior regions (enclosed by 7s) stay unfilled, potentially with subtle rules like no 2x2 0-blocks or region sizes matching clues (e.g., a "1" clue might protect a single adjacent 0 or itself).
 * Existing 7s act as barriers but also as seeds for filling adjacent 0s; interior 7s do not propagate filling unless connected via the flood (but current code doesn't seed interior 7s).
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s aren't always filled (e.g., train2 row1 0s remain 0 despite top-border proximity), so connectivity must consider enclosures created by numbers/7s; overflooding happens if ignoring that some 0s are "internal" even near borders.
 * No diagonal connectivity (only orthogonal, as in code's dirs); all changes are iterative but single-pass flood suffices if seeded correctly.
 * Across attempts, no handling for clue-based filling (e.g., expanding regions from numbers) or validation rules (e.g., ensuring no touching interiors), leading to mismatches in both over- and under-filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `fill_exterior_0s` function is partially helpful as a flood-fill base for exterior 0s but broken (incomplete border seeding leads to underfilling; fix by adding bottom/right border seeding loops similar to top/left). It correctly propagates only through 0s and preserves non-0s.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = 16
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # Start from all four borders: cells that are 0 or 7
    # Top
    for c in range(n):
        if h[0][c] == 0 or h[0][c] == 7:
            q.append((0, c))
            visited[0][c] = True
    # Bottom
    for c in range(n):
        if h[n-1][c] == 0 or h[n-1][c] == 7:
            if not visited[n-1][c]:
                q.append((n-1, c))
                visited[n-1][c] = True
    # Left (skip corners if already visited)
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][0] == 0 or h[r][0] == 7:
            if not visited[r][0]:
                q.append((r, 0))
                visited[r][0] = True
    # Right
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][n-1] == 0 or h[r][n-1] == 7:
            if not visited[r][n-1]:
                q.append((r, n-1))
                visited[r][n-1] = True
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while q:
        r, c = q.popleft()
        if h[r][c] == 0:
            h[r][c] = 7
        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and h[nr][nc] == 0:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                q.append((nr, nc))
    return h
```

No other helpful functions from the attempt; no types or object-extraction tools were used or needed yet (e.g., no need for extracting regions around clues).

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
The `fill_isolated_non7` function is broken and irrelevant: it incorrectly changes fixed clue numbers (non-0 non-7) to 7 based on >=3 adjacent 7s, but expected outputs preserve all clues unchanged. It also doesn't affect 0s and runs in a loop that may over-apply, leading to invalid changes (e.g., in train1 row12, it left some clues but expected filled areas to 7 without changing clues elsewhere). Do not use in future attempts.

```python
def fill_isolated_non7(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:  # Broken: changes clues, ignores 0s, not puzzle-relevant
    # ... (code as provided, but discard)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incomplete flood fill (only top/left borders seeded, causing underfilling of 0s connected via bottom/right, e.g., train1 row6 left as [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,5,7,...] vs. expected all 7s; train3 row12-15 similar underfill of 0s).
 * Overfilling in non-enclosed areas: e.g., train2 row1 0s filled to 7s ([7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,...] generated vs. expected [7,7,7,3,7,7,0,0,0,7,...] with 0s preserved), suggesting border 0s aren't always exterior if part of interior structures.
 * Clue preservation failed indirectly: `fill_isolated_non7` didn't change most clues but was applied after flood, leaving mismatches where entire regions should be 7-filled without altering clues (e.g., train1 row7 generated [7,7,7,0,0,9,0,2,9,0,0,7,...] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,...], where 0s/clues stayed but should have been filled around/nearby).
 * Train1: Underfilled interior 0s (row6, row7 partial, row12 start [9,5,...] vs. expected 7s); overfilled nothing obvious but last two 0s correctly preserved in row7/8.
 * Train2: Severe overfilling of upper 0s (rows1-6 all mostly 7s generated vs. expected with 0-clusters and embedded clues like 1,5,2,6,9,8); lower 0s underfilled due to no right-border seed (row11-13 0s at end left vs. expected preserved as interior).
 * Train3: Underfilled lower 0s (rows12-15 [...,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] patterns vs. expected with some 7-fills but preserved 0-clusters around clues like 9,8,6,1,2); top overfilled slightly (row2 [7,7,8,3,...] but expected [7,7,8,3,...] similar, minor diff in row0 [7,7,7,3,...] vs. [7,6,7,3,...] unknown why 5->7? Wait, likely input diff but code filled adjacent 0s wrong).
 * No extraction of objects/regions (e.g., no function to identify clue-connected 0-clusters), missing for handling interior protections.
 * `fill_isolated_non7` caused no visible changes in most cases (clues had <3 adj 7s post-flood) but is conceptually wrong; remove it.
 * Overall, no handling for why some 0-clusters remain (e.g., enclosure by 7s/numbers) or clue implications (e.g., numbers protecting adjacent 0s from filling).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills some border-adjacent 0s (e.g., row5 [9,0,7,...] likely filled 0 to 7 incorrectly if that 0 is interior-protected like train2) and underfills lower/middle 0-clusters (e.g., rows7-15 have many unfilled 0s around clues like 2,4,1,9,5,6,8, but expected likely preserves some as interior while filling others to 7 based on connectivity/enclosure).
 * Specifically, row6 generated all 7s except scattered, but test input has 0s in row5 col10-15 [9,0,0,0,0,0], likely underfilled due to missing right-border seed (should connect via right if exterior).
 * Middle areas (rows7-9 cols3-15) have 0s preserved around clues (e.g., 2,4,0s), but if connected to bottom/right, they should be 7s per partial rules, yet code leaves them 0—mismatch similar to train1 underfill.
 * Lower rows (12-15) have 0s at ends (e.g., row12 col15=0, row13 col9=1 but adjacent 0s), looking like unfilled interiors, but without full borders seeded, it ignores potential exterior paths; also no clue changes, which is good, but overall too many 0s remain compared to expected patterns in training (e.g., train2 preserves 0-clusters but fills disconnected ones).
 * Does not account for protected 0s near borders (like train2 row1), leading to potential overfill in test's upper 0s (row5-6); unknown if test has enclosed regions with multiple clues (like train2 lower left), but code would fill them wrong without region extraction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where 7 represents barriers or walls, non-7 cells (0-6,8,9) represent open spaces, air, or labeled objects, and the task is to identify connected components of these non-7 cells using 4-way adjacency, then fill (set to 7) only those components that are fully enclosed—specifically, those not touching the top row (row 0) or bottom row (row n-1)—effectively removing "trapped" or floating regions while preserving components connected to the top or bottom (possibly simulating exposure to air or ground).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connectivity is strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only through non-7 cells; diagonal does not count.
 * Components are groups of adjacent non-7 cells; all non-7 values (including numbers 1-9 and 0s) are treated as connectable in the current approach, but this may be a subtlety—numbers 1-9 might represent solid "objects" that should block connectivity for air (0s only) or require special handling to preserve their positions and surrounding 0s if the object touches the bottom.
 * Filling only occurs for components not touching top or bottom rows; components touching either are preserved entirely (including their internal structure of 0s and numbers), which suggests a "grounded" or "exposed" rule where bottom-touching structures (e.g., cave formations or lakes) stay intact.
 * Subtle element: The puzzle likely preserves complex structures (e.g., "islands" or "pockets" with embedded numbers surrounded by 0s) if they touch the bottom, but the current flood fill merges separate structures incorrectly if they are connected through non-7 paths that shouldn't be (e.g., treating numbers as passable air).
 * Easy to miss: Not all enclosed areas are filled—only truly trapped ones; side-touching but bottom-touching components must be preserved, and the program may overfill by not distinguishing between air (0s) and objects (1-9). In expected outputs, preserved areas often have intricate patterns of 0s around numbers, suggesting objects define boundaries rather than being filled themselves.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, reflection, or value modification beyond filling to 7; grid size n=16 in examples; 7s are immutable barriers that block all connectivity and filling.
 * Potential misinterpretation: This isn't simple border flooding (e.g., from all sides); the top/bottom check implies vertical exposure (e.g., air from top, ground from bottom), not full perimeter. Numbers 1-9 are preserved in place in expected outputs, so filling shouldn't overwrite them unless the entire component is trapped.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program includes useful building blocks for component detection and filling, which align with core flood-fill logic.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def is_non_seven(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] != 7
```
(This bounds-checks and identifies traversable non-7 cells; helpful for any connectivity-based approach.)

```python
def touches_top_or_bottom(component: List[tuple], n: int) -> bool:
    for x, y in component:
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
            return True
    return False
```
(This correctly identifies exposure to top/bottom; essential for the enclosure rule, though may need extension to preserve side/bottom structures.)

```python
def flood_component(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[tuple]:
    component = []
    q = deque([(x, y)])
    visited[x][y] = True
    while q:
        cx, cy = q.popleft()
        component.append((cx, cy))
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_non_seven(nx, ny, g, n) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return component
```
(This performs accurate 4-way BFS flood fill to extract components; very helpful and not broken—reuse it, but consider modifying is_non_seven to only traverse 0s if numbers are solid.)

The main program function integrates these well for iteration and filling but over-applies filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly solved training example 1 by properly identifying and filling enclosed non-7 components not touching top/bottom, preserving exposed ones.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated overfilled the grid, turning most middle and left-bottom areas to 7s (e.g., rows 1-10 mostly 7s except top-left 3s/5/6, and only a small bottom-right pocket with 0s/6/5/1/9 preserved), while expected preserves two separate structures—a middle-right pocket (rows 1-7, cols 6-15 with 0s/1/0/5/2/6/8/9) and a bottom-left pocket (rows 9-14, cols 1-8 with 0s/1/5/9/8/2/4)—likely because they touch bottom/sides but were incorrectly merged or deemed non-touching top/bottom.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated overfilled similarly, preserving only top-left (3s/6/8) and a tiny bottom-right strip (0s in col 14-15, rows 12-15), while expected preserves top-left plus a large middle-left structure (rows 5-14, cols 1-9 with 0s/5/2/1/9/6/8) and bottom-right 0s; difference is unknown but likely due to incorrect connectivity through numbers, filling bottom-touching components that should stay (e.g., expected keeps row 5-9 left with 0s/5/2/1).
 * Core issue across failures: Treats all non-7 (including 1-9) as connectable air, leading to over-merging and over-filling of preserved structures; expected outputs keep embedded numbers and surrounding 0s in bottom-touching "objects" intact, suggesting numbers may act as barriers for air fill or define preservable blobs.
 * touches_top_or_bottom is helpful but insufficient alone—may need to check bottom-only touching for preservation, or flood from bottom border to mark reachable areas instead of component-based filling.
 * No unhelpful functions here; all provided (is_non_seven, flood_component, touches_top_or_bottom) are relevant and functional, though is_non_seven may need tweaking to exclude 1-9 if they are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially resembles the incorrect training 2/3 patterns: It preserves top-left structure (rows 0-4, cols 0-5 with 2/5/4/3s and some 0s/6/1) and a large bottom-right/middle area (rows 5-15, cols 6-15 with scattered 0s/8/5/2/4/1/9), but fills middle areas with 7s (e.g., row 5 cols 0-5 has 9/0 then 7s).
 * It does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfilling seen in failed trainings (e.g., likely merged or incorrectly filled bottom-left/middle components that should be preserved like in training 2/3 expecteds, where multiple bottom-touching pockets with 0s around numbers remain); for instance, the test has isolated 9/0/8 in row 6-7 left, but if similar to trainings, this might be an overfilled "object" that should connect to a larger preserved structure touching bottom—unknown exact reason, but the sparse preservation suggests same connectivity error, leaving too few complex pockets.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 01:40:55] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle task where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects, blobs, or patterns) to produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The puzzle involves understanding and applying rules to extract, manipulate, or match elements in these grids, but the previous attempt failed at the fundamental level of code structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations (training and test) fail with an error, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Grids are represented as lists of lists of integers (e.g., List[List[int]]), likely encoding visual features like colors, shapes, holes, or boundaries that need to be parsed into higher-level puzzle elements.
 * Puzzle rules probably involve identifying and extracting "objects" or "blobs" (connected components), counting features like holes, and applying transformations or matches based on keys or patterns—subtleties include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or components that don't span the full grid.
 * Outputs must match expected results exactly for training examples (which are not shown here but implied to be specific grid manipulations) and the test input; mismatches could stem from incorrect object detection, omission of certain elements, or failure to account for connectivity rules (e.g., 4-connected vs. 8-connected pixels).
 * Consider iterative refinement: mentally simulate grid processing to verify logic, as errors in extraction can propagate to all outputs.
 * All attempts so far show no successful processing, so focus on basic code validity before puzzle-specific logic like hole counting or shape matching.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions, types, or tools were generated in the previous attempt, as the code failed to define the required 'program' function. Future attempts should start with a skeleton like:

```python
def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Placeholder: implement grid processing here
    return grid  # Or transformed output
```

Functions like object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for blobs or hole detection) would be essential but are absent; avoid assuming untested tools without validation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed with the same error: "Generated code does not contain 'program' function," indicating a complete structural failure rather than puzzle logic issues.
 * Nothing worked: no outputs were generated, so no partial credit for logic, extraction, or matching.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the code requirements, let alone the puzzle rules, as it didn't produce any valid program to evaluate.
 * No functions for extracting objects (e.g., identifying blobs, counting holes, or detecting dividers) were included, making the code irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * This is the only attempt referenced, but it highlights the need to prioritize code format over premature puzzle solving.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense as a valid result—it indicates the code couldn't even be executed, so no puzzle processing occurred.
 * Without a proper output, it's impossible to verify if it matches the expected test result (e.g., a transformed grid accounting for objects, holes, or patterns); this is fundamentally different from any expected valid output, which should be a processed grid.
 * The error suggests the test case (an unseen grid) wasn't handled at all, missing all puzzle elements like object extraction or rule application—future attempts must ensure the 'program' function exists to even attempt matching the test.

**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 16x16 grid containing 0s (empty/unfilled cells), 7s (background or wall cells), and numbers 1-9 (likely clues, objects, or barriers). The goal is to produce an output grid by filling certain 0s with 7s to distinguish exterior/unbounded regions from internal enclosed regions, while preserving numbers 1-9 and existing 7s unchanged; internal 0 regions that are fully enclosed (not connected to the border) should remain 0, forming shapes or "rooms" around or between numbered clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s represent traversable empty space for flooding/propagation, but only those connected to the grid border should be filled with 7 (exterior region); disconnected internal 0 clusters must remain 0 to match enclosed areas in expected outputs.
 * Numbers 1-9 act as barriers: the flood cannot pass through or over them (they block adjacency for 0-paths), and they remain unchanged in the output.
 * 7s are pre-filled background/walls: they block flooding (cannot traverse them) but may influence starting points for the fill.
 * Subtlety: Defining "connected to border" is critical and tricky—simple adjacency via 0-paths to border 0s may miss regions adjacent only to border 7s or border numbers; conversely, over-seeding from border 7s can incorrectly fill internal regions by treating border-adjacent 0s as exterior even if isolated internally.
 * The grid borders themselves may contain 0s, 7s, or numbers, complicating seeding: if a border cell is a number, adjacent internal 0s might need filling if considered exterior, but this risks over-filling.
 * No diagonal movement: flooding uses 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).
 * Multiple disconnected 0 regions exist; only the one touching the border gets filled—internal ones stay 0, often forming blob-like shapes in expected outputs (e.g., surrounding numbers without touching borders).
 * Potential for 2x2 or larger empty internal areas that must remain 0; over-filling these violates the enclosure rule.
 * The puzzle may involve implicit rules like no touching islands or connected sea, but based on outputs, the core is exterior vs. interior 0 regions.
 * Visually, expected outputs show 0s clustering into enclosed "pockets" (e.g., around numbers in ex2 upper grid, or linear paths in ex1 lower grid), suggesting the fill must precisely avoid crossing number barriers.
 * Copying the grid is essential to avoid mutating the input.
 * Visited tracking prevents revisiting and ensures efficient BFS/DFS flooding.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for safe grid duplication before modification.)

```python
def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # (Current seeding logic, but flawed: starts from border 0 or 7)
    # ... (rest of BFS as in attempt)
    return h
```
(This BFS flood-fill structure is helpful and core to the problem, as it correctly handles 4-dir propagation through 0s and visited tracking; it just needs seeding and enqueue conditions fixed to properly distinguish exterior from interior. Use DFS as alternative if needed for recursion.)

(No other functions like object extraction are present or needed; the problem doesn't require identifying or counting objects around numbers—it's purely about regional filling of 0s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses a BFS flood-fill starting from all border cells that are 0 or 7, propagating only through unvisited 0s and setting them to 7; this partially understands the exterior-filling concept but fails consistently due to incorrect seeding, leading to under-filling in some cases and over-filling in others.
 * In training example 1: Generated under-filled (left 0s remaining) in row 6 (cols 3-6 and 9-10 as 0,0,0,0 and 0,0) and mismatched lower regions (e.g., row 7 has 0s at cols 3-6,9-10,13 but expected has all 7s in row 6 and specific 0s only in lower rows like row 7 cols 14-15, row 9 cols 14-15, row 10 col 15, row 11 cols 8-11,13-15, etc.); upper rows 0-5 mostly match, but the fill didn't reach some exterior 0s (possibly due to number barriers or seeding missing border numbers), while incorrectly leaving internal-adjacent 0s unfilled when expected treats them as exterior.
 * In training example 2: Generated over-filled massively (e.g., row 1 all 7s except numbers, but expected has 0s at cols 6-8 and 12-14; row 2 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols 7-8,13,15? Wait, col15 is 4 in expected? Actually cols 7-8=0,0 and col13=0? No, expected row2: 0s at 6? Wait, [5,7,6,3,7,7,1,0,0,7,7,7,6,0,4,7] so 0s at cols7-8,13; generated has all 7s there), turning most internal 0 clusters to 7 when expected preserves them as enclosed regions (e.g., 0s forming shapes around numbers in rows 1-7 and separate pockets in rows 9-14); this suggests seeding from border 7s incorrectly treated internal components adjacent to background as exterior.
 * In training example 3: Generated over-filled internal areas (e.g., row 5 all 7s except some numbers like 5,9,5 but expected has 0s at cols1-5; row 7 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols1-2? Wait, expected row6: [7,0,0,0,0,0,7,...] so 0s cols1-5, but generated row6? Wait, rows are 0-indexed, generated row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,9,7,5,7] filled to 7s where expected has 0s; lower rows like 9-15 have some 0s filled differently, e.g., row9 generated has 0s at cols9-12 but expected has more structured 0s in cols1-3,4-5?); upper rows 0-3 mostly match, but fill invaded enclosed 0 pockets (e.g., row6-9 expected 0 clusters around numbers, but generated filled them).
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates understanding of BFS for regional filling and barrier handling (numbers/7s not traversed), but misses subtle seeding: including border 7s causes over-filling of near-border internals in ex2/ex3, while failing to fill some exterior 0s in ex1 (possibly because those 0s are only adjacent to border numbers, not enqueued); no object extraction needed, as numbers stay fixed—no counting holes or blobs required.
 * The copy_grid function works correctly and should be retained; fill_exterior_0s is mostly helpful but broken in seeding/enqueue logic (don't use as-is; modify to experiment with seeding only border 0s or all border cells).
 * No unhelpful functions present, but the current enqueue condition (only if h[nr][nc] == 0) is correct—don't change that; the issue is solely in initial queue population.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples; it over-fills some internal 0s (e.g., row 5 has isolated 0 at col1? Wait, row5: [9,0,7,7,...] leaves one 0 but fills around it, while expected likely wants enclosed clusters like in ex3 row5; row6: [7,8,7,0,0,7,...] leaves 0s at cols3-4 but fills others, potentially invading what should be internal pockets similar to ex2's preserved 0 shapes).
 * It under-fills or mismatches in lower rows (e.g., row12: [5,7,7,5,0,7,...] leaves scattered 0s, but training patterns suggest more structured enclosed 0s or full filling of exterior chains); overall, it resembles the over-filling in ex2/ex3 (many 7s with sparse 0s) rather than balanced exterior-only fill, so it likely incorrectly treats some internal regions as exterior due to seeding flaws—e.g., 0s in rows 6-9 cols3-4 seem like a small pocket that might should remain if enclosed, but without exact expected, it doesn't match the "enclosed blobs" subtlety seen in training.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a 16x16 grid-based logic puzzle where input grids contain 0s (empty cells), 7s (pre-filled cells, likely representing "sea" or "exterior" filler), and scattered numbers (1-6, 8, 9 as fixed clues). The goal is to fill certain 0s with 7s based on connectivity rules to determine "exterior" or fillable regions, while leaving other 0s unfilled (likely interior or clue-related regions) and preserving all clue numbers unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s connected via other 0s to any border (top, bottom, left, right) should generally be filled with 7s, treating border 7s as starting points for propagation, but not all border-adjacent 0s are filled (e.g., some interior-touching border 0s remain 0 in expected outputs, suggesting over-simple flood fill overfills).
 * Propagation only through 0s (not through numbers or existing 7s beyond seeding), but seeding must include all four borders; missing bottom/right seeding leads to underfilling in enclosed-but-exterior-connected areas.
 * Clue numbers (1-6, 8, 9) must never be changed to 7; they remain fixed regardless of adjacency to 7s, indicating they define or protect interior regions (e.g., possible island clues in a Nurikabe-like puzzle where 7 is sea and 0s are island spaces).
 * Some interior regions of 0s and numbers are completely filled to 7s in expected outputs (e.g., no remaining 0s or numbers in certain blocks), suggesting rules for identifying "degenerate" or non-protected regions that get fully filled, possibly if they violate enclosure or size rules.
 * Remaining 0s form connected clusters often adjacent to or containing clue numbers, implying 0s in "protected" interior regions (enclosed by 7s) stay unfilled, potentially with subtle rules like no 2x2 0-blocks or region sizes matching clues (e.g., a "1" clue might protect a single adjacent 0 or itself).
 * Existing 7s act as barriers but also as seeds for filling adjacent 0s; interior 7s do not propagate filling unless connected via the flood (but current code doesn't seed interior 7s).
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s aren't always filled (e.g., train2 row1 0s remain 0 despite top-border proximity), so connectivity must consider enclosures created by numbers/7s; overflooding happens if ignoring that some 0s are "internal" even near borders.
 * No diagonal connectivity (only orthogonal, as in code's dirs); all changes are iterative but single-pass flood suffices if seeded correctly.
 * Across attempts, no handling for clue-based filling (e.g., expanding regions from numbers) or validation rules (e.g., ensuring no touching interiors), leading to mismatches in both over- and under-filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `fill_exterior_0s` function is partially helpful as a flood-fill base for exterior 0s but broken (incomplete border seeding leads to underfilling; fix by adding bottom/right border seeding loops similar to top/left). It correctly propagates only through 0s and preserves non-0s.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = 16
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # Start from all four borders: cells that are 0 or 7
    # Top
    for c in range(n):
        if h[0][c] == 0 or h[0][c] == 7:
            q.append((0, c))
            visited[0][c] = True
    # Bottom
    for c in range(n):
        if h[n-1][c] == 0 or h[n-1][c] == 7:
            if not visited[n-1][c]:
                q.append((n-1, c))
                visited[n-1][c] = True
    # Left (skip corners if already visited)
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][0] == 0 or h[r][0] == 7:
            if not visited[r][0]:
                q.append((r, 0))
                visited[r][0] = True
    # Right
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][n-1] == 0 or h[r][n-1] == 7:
            if not visited[r][n-1]:
                q.append((r, n-1))
                visited[r][n-1] = True
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while q:
        r, c = q.popleft()
        if h[r][c] == 0:
            h[r][c] = 7
        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and h[nr][nc] == 0:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                q.append((nr, nc))
    return h
```

No other helpful functions from the attempt; no types or object-extraction tools were used or needed yet (e.g., no need for extracting regions around clues).

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
The `fill_isolated_non7` function is broken and irrelevant: it incorrectly changes fixed clue numbers (non-0 non-7) to 7 based on >=3 adjacent 7s, but expected outputs preserve all clues unchanged. It also doesn't affect 0s and runs in a loop that may over-apply, leading to invalid changes (e.g., in train1 row12, it left some clues but expected filled areas to 7 without changing clues elsewhere). Do not use in future attempts.

```python
def fill_isolated_non7(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:  # Broken: changes clues, ignores 0s, not puzzle-relevant
    # ... (code as provided, but discard)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incomplete flood fill (only top/left borders seeded, causing underfilling of 0s connected via bottom/right, e.g., train1 row6 left as [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,5,7,...] vs. expected all 7s; train3 row12-15 similar underfill of 0s).
 * Overfilling in non-enclosed areas: e.g., train2 row1 0s filled to 7s ([7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,...] generated vs. expected [7,7,7,3,7,7,0,0,0,7,...] with 0s preserved), suggesting border 0s aren't always exterior if part of interior structures.
 * Clue preservation failed indirectly: `fill_isolated_non7` didn't change most clues but was applied after flood, leaving mismatches where entire regions should be 7-filled without altering clues (e.g., train1 row7 generated [7,7,7,0,0,9,0,2,9,0,0,7,...] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,...], where 0s/clues stayed but should have been filled around/nearby).
 * Train1: Underfilled interior 0s (row6, row7 partial, row12 start [9,5,...] vs. expected 7s); overfilled nothing obvious but last two 0s correctly preserved in row7/8.
 * Train2: Severe overfilling of upper 0s (rows1-6 all mostly 7s generated vs. expected with 0-clusters and embedded clues like 1,5,2,6,9,8); lower 0s underfilled due to no right-border seed (row11-13 0s at end left vs. expected preserved as interior).
 * Train3: Underfilled lower 0s (rows12-15 [...,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] patterns vs. expected with some 7-fills but preserved 0-clusters around clues like 9,8,6,1,2); top overfilled slightly (row2 [7,7,8,3,...] but expected [7,7,8,3,...] similar, minor diff in row0 [7,7,7,3,...] vs. [7,6,7,3,...] unknown why 5->7? Wait, likely input diff but code filled adjacent 0s wrong).
 * No extraction of objects/regions (e.g., no function to identify clue-connected 0-clusters), missing for handling interior protections.
 * `fill_isolated_non7` caused no visible changes in most cases (clues had <3 adj 7s post-flood) but is conceptually wrong; remove it.
 * Overall, no handling for why some 0-clusters remain (e.g., enclosure by 7s/numbers) or clue implications (e.g., numbers protecting adjacent 0s from filling).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills some border-adjacent 0s (e.g., row5 [9,0,7,...] likely filled 0 to 7 incorrectly if that 0 is interior-protected like train2) and underfills lower/middle 0-clusters (e.g., rows7-15 have many unfilled 0s around clues like 2,4,1,9,5,6,8, but expected likely preserves some as interior while filling others to 7 based on connectivity/enclosure).
 * Specifically, row6 generated all 7s except scattered, but test input has 0s in row5 col10-15 [9,0,0,0,0,0], likely underfilled due to missing right-border seed (should connect via right if exterior).
 * Middle areas (rows7-9 cols3-15) have 0s preserved around clues (e.g., 2,4,0s), but if connected to bottom/right, they should be 7s per partial rules, yet code leaves them 0—mismatch similar to train1 underfill.
 * Lower rows (12-15) have 0s at ends (e.g., row12 col15=0, row13 col9=1 but adjacent 0s), looking like unfilled interiors, but without full borders seeded, it ignores potential exterior paths; also no clue changes, which is good, but overall too many 0s remain compared to expected patterns in training (e.g., train2 preserves 0-clusters but fills disconnected ones).
 * Does not account for protected 0s near borders (like train2 row1), leading to potential overfill in test's upper 0s (row5-6); unknown if test has enclosed regions with multiple clues (like train2 lower left), but code would fill them wrong without region extraction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where 7 represents barriers or walls, non-7 cells (0-6,8,9) represent open spaces, air, or labeled objects, and the task is to identify connected components of these non-7 cells using 4-way adjacency, then fill (set to 7) only those components that are fully enclosed—specifically, those not touching the top row (row 0) or bottom row (row n-1)—effectively removing "trapped" or floating regions while preserving components connected to the top or bottom (possibly simulating exposure to air or ground).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connectivity is strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only through non-7 cells; diagonal does not count.
 * Components are groups of adjacent non-7 cells; all non-7 values (including numbers 1-9 and 0s) are treated as connectable in the current approach, but this may be a subtlety—numbers 1-9 might represent solid "objects" that should block connectivity for air (0s only) or require special handling to preserve their positions and surrounding 0s if the object touches the bottom.
 * Filling only occurs for components not touching top or bottom rows; components touching either are preserved entirely (including their internal structure of 0s and numbers), which suggests a "grounded" or "exposed" rule where bottom-touching structures (e.g., cave formations or lakes) stay intact.
 * Subtle element: The puzzle likely preserves complex structures (e.g., "islands" or "pockets" with embedded numbers surrounded by 0s) if they touch the bottom, but the current flood fill merges separate structures incorrectly if they are connected through non-7 paths that shouldn't be (e.g., treating numbers as passable air).
 * Easy to miss: Not all enclosed areas are filled—only truly trapped ones; side-touching but bottom-touching components must be preserved, and the program may overfill by not distinguishing between air (0s) and objects (1-9). In expected outputs, preserved areas often have intricate patterns of 0s around numbers, suggesting objects define boundaries rather than being filled themselves.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, reflection, or value modification beyond filling to 7; grid size n=16 in examples; 7s are immutable barriers that block all connectivity and filling.
 * Potential misinterpretation: This isn't simple border flooding (e.g., from all sides); the top/bottom check implies vertical exposure (e.g., air from top, ground from bottom), not full perimeter. Numbers 1-9 are preserved in place in expected outputs, so filling shouldn't overwrite them unless the entire component is trapped.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program includes useful building blocks for component detection and filling, which align with core flood-fill logic.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def is_non_seven(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] != 7
```
(This bounds-checks and identifies traversable non-7 cells; helpful for any connectivity-based approach.)

```python
def touches_top_or_bottom(component: List[tuple], n: int) -> bool:
    for x, y in component:
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
            return True
    return False
```
(This correctly identifies exposure to top/bottom; essential for the enclosure rule, though may need extension to preserve side/bottom structures.)

```python
def flood_component(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[tuple]:
    component = []
    q = deque([(x, y)])
    visited[x][y] = True
    while q:
        cx, cy = q.popleft()
        component.append((cx, cy))
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_non_seven(nx, ny, g, n) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return component
```
(This performs accurate 4-way BFS flood fill to extract components; very helpful and not broken—reuse it, but consider modifying is_non_seven to only traverse 0s if numbers are solid.)

The main program function integrates these well for iteration and filling but over-applies filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly solved training example 1 by properly identifying and filling enclosed non-7 components not touching top/bottom, preserving exposed ones.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated overfilled the grid, turning most middle and left-bottom areas to 7s (e.g., rows 1-10 mostly 7s except top-left 3s/5/6, and only a small bottom-right pocket with 0s/6/5/1/9 preserved), while expected preserves two separate structures—a middle-right pocket (rows 1-7, cols 6-15 with 0s/1/0/5/2/6/8/9) and a bottom-left pocket (rows 9-14, cols 1-8 with 0s/1/5/9/8/2/4)—likely because they touch bottom/sides but were incorrectly merged or deemed non-touching top/bottom.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated overfilled similarly, preserving only top-left (3s/6/8) and a tiny bottom-right strip (0s in col 14-15, rows 12-15), while expected preserves top-left plus a large middle-left structure (rows 5-14, cols 1-9 with 0s/5/2/1/9/6/8) and bottom-right 0s; difference is unknown but likely due to incorrect connectivity through numbers, filling bottom-touching components that should stay (e.g., expected keeps row 5-9 left with 0s/5/2/1).
 * Core issue across failures: Treats all non-7 (including 1-9) as connectable air, leading to over-merging and over-filling of preserved structures; expected outputs keep embedded numbers and surrounding 0s in bottom-touching "objects" intact, suggesting numbers may act as barriers for air fill or define preservable blobs.
 * touches_top_or_bottom is helpful but insufficient alone—may need to check bottom-only touching for preservation, or flood from bottom border to mark reachable areas instead of component-based filling.
 * No unhelpful functions here; all provided (is_non_seven, flood_component, touches_top_or_bottom) are relevant and functional, though is_non_seven may need tweaking to exclude 1-9 if they are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially resembles the incorrect training 2/3 patterns: It preserves top-left structure (rows 0-4, cols 0-5 with 2/5/4/3s and some 0s/6/1) and a large bottom-right/middle area (rows 5-15, cols 6-15 with scattered 0s/8/5/2/4/1/9), but fills middle areas with 7s (e.g., row 5 cols 0-5 has 9/0 then 7s).
 * It does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfilling seen in failed trainings (e.g., likely merged or incorrectly filled bottom-left/middle components that should be preserved like in training 2/3 expecteds, where multiple bottom-touching pockets with 0s around numbers remain); for instance, the test has isolated 9/0/8 in row 6-7 left, but if similar to trainings, this might be an overfilled "object" that should connect to a larger preserved structure touching bottom—unknown exact reason, but the sparse preservation suggests same connectivity error, leaving too few complex pockets.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 02:16:30] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 02:17:24] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of Python code that defines a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The goal is to analyze grids, extract or manipulate elements according to puzzle rules, and output results that match expected patterns, but the previous attempt failed due to a fundamental structural issue in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must include a 'program' function as the entry point; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of logic.
 * Grids are represented as List[List[int]], where values likely encode visual features (e.g., 0 for empty, positive ints for object types, colors, or shapes).
 * Puzzle rules probably involve identifying and extracting "objects" (connected components or blobs) from the grid, counting features like holes or sizes, and applying transformations or matches to a "key" pattern.
 * Subtle elements: Handle edge cases like disconnected objects, irregular shapes, or grids where objects don't span the full width/height; ensure outputs preserve grid dimensions or format exactly (e.g., no extra spaces or modified boundaries).
 * Outputs should be grids or simplified representations that visually or structurally match expectations, potentially omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching a key criteria like hole count).
 * Consider rotational symmetry, mirroring, or adjacency rules for object validation, as visual puzzles often include these.
 * All training examples and test must pass independently; partial logic won't suffice if the function is missing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

class GridObject:
    def __init__(self, positions: List[tuple], hole_count: int = 0, size: int = 0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples for connected cells
        self.hole_count = hole_count
        self.size = size
```

```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[GridObject]:
    # Flood-fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (objects) in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming 0 is background
                component = dfs(grid, i, j, visited)  # Implement DFS to get positions, count holes
                hole_count = count_holes(component, grid)  # Custom function to detect enclosed zeros
                objects.append(GridObject(component, hole_count, len(component)))
    return objects
```

```python
def count_holes(component: List[tuple], grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Placeholder: Analyze bounding box of component for enclosed empty cells (0s)
    # This is subtle and easy to miss—holes are internal voids, not external spaces
    min_r, max_r = min(p[0] for p in component), max(p[0] for p in component)
    min_c, max_c = min(p[1] for p in component), max(p[1] for p in component)
    internal_zeros = 0
    for r in range(min_r + 1, max_r):  # Skip borders
        for c in range(min_c + 1, max_c):
            if grid[r][c] == 0 and is_enclosed((r, c), component):  # Check if surrounded
                internal_zeros += 1
    return internal_zeros // 4  # Approximate for 4-connected holes; refine based on puzzle
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated program lacked the required 'program' function entirely, causing immediate errors across all training examples and the test input.
 * No object extraction or grid processing logic was present, so nothing worked—complete structural failure.
 * No evidence of understanding grid representation or visual rules; code was invalid Python for the puzzle framework.
 * Function to extract objects wasn't attempted, which is essential for identifying blobs, holes, or matches in visual puzzles.
 * All attempts (only one shown) resulted in the same error, indicating no progress on core requirements.
 * The extract_objects function (not used) would be helpful, but without it, puzzles involving connected components can't be solved.
 * No unhelpful functions were generated, but future attempts should avoid incomplete code skeletons without the 'program' entry point.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not look correct because it indicates a total failure to produce valid, runnable code.
 * No actual output grid or processed result was generated, so it can't be compared to expected puzzle solution (e.g., a transformed grid matching visual rules).
 * This differs from expectations: The test input grid should yield a specific output (e.g., extracted objects or a modified grid omitting invalid elements), but instead, evaluation halted early—likely the expected output involves applying rules like hole counting or shape matching, which wasn't reached.
 * The error persists across all cases, confirming the code doesn't handle any input correctly, including the test's unique grid features (e.g., possibly irregular objects or a key pattern).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 02:18:04] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on comparing the input and output lists across all three training examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** puzzle. These are limited to elements that demonstrably affect or are affected by each other (e.g., via changes in pixel count, presence/absence, or other properties). Only properties with 100% consistency across all trains are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., those unchanged or uninvolved) are noted only if they contrast with interactions. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided; unknown aspects (e.g., selection rules) are explicitly called out.

#### 1. **Large Dark Red Component (bbox=[0,0,15,15]) Interaction with Select Small Non-Dark Red Components**
   - **Description**: In every training example, the large Dark Red component (the dominant filled region spanning the full grid) interacts with a subset of small components of other colors. These small components disappear entirely from the output, and their pixels are transferred to the large Dark Red component, consistently increasing its pixel count (e.g., +79 in Train 1, +25 in Train 2, +81 in Train 3).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Pixel count of large Dark Red: Always increases (direct effect from absorbed pixels).
     - Presence of select small components: Always removed (they no longer appear as separate entries in outputs).
   - **Involved Components**:
     - Small components of colors including (but not limited to) Yellow, Blue, Light Blue, Pink, Orange, Red, and Maroon. These are typically 1-2 pixel blobs or small clusters (holes=0, pixels=1-2, irregular bboxes).
     - Interaction is not universal—all small components of these colors do not interact (some remain unchanged; see fixed elements below).
   - **Connection Type**: Position and/or spatial relationship (e.g., proximity within the [0,0,15,15] bbox) likely influences selection for interaction, as all grids are 16x16 and non-overlapping. However, the exact selection rule (why specific small components interact while others of the same color/size do not) is unknown and not consistent/identifiable from positions, colors, or other properties alone.
   - **Consistency Note**: This pixel transfer and removal happens in every example, but the number and specific identities of interacting small components vary (e.g., 20+ disappear in Train 1, fewer in Train 2).

#### 2. **No Consistent Effect on Holes in Large Dark Red**
   - The holes property of the large Dark Red (input holes=2-3) changes in some examples (decreases in Train 1 and Train 3) but remains unchanged in others (Train 2: holes=3 → 3). This is not a consistent interaction effect, though it may relate to the pixel additions above when holes are filled. The rule for when/if holes decrease is unknown.

#### 3. **Fixed Elements with No Interactions**
   - These elements appear in every input and output, unchanged in all properties (color, bbox, pixels, holes). They do not interact with the large Dark Red or any other components (no absorption, no changes).
     - **Green Component**: bbox=[0,0,3,3], holes=0, pixels=7. Consistent top-left filled square/cluster; unaffected.
     - **Small Dark Red Component**: bbox=[0,0,2,2], holes=0, pixels=5-6 (minor variation in Train 3 input due to a separate 1-pixel Dark Red at [0,0,0,0] that disappears, but the main small component remains stable). Does not merge with or affect the large Dark Red.

#### Excluded Elements and Non-Interactions
- **Irrelevant or Inconsistent Elements**: Individual small components of the interacting colors (e.g., specific Yellow or Pink blobs) that remain in some outputs but not others show no consistent interaction across all examples. Their presence/absence varies without a clear pattern tying to properties like color, position, edges, holes (all=0), or silhouettes.
- **No Inter-Component Interactions Among Small Colors**: No evidence of small components affecting each other (e.g., no color changes, position shifts, or merges between Yellow → Blue or similar). Changes only involve removal/addition to large Dark Red.
- **No Consistent Transformations Beyond Pixels/Presence**: No reliable changes in bbox, holes (for small components), or other shape properties (e.g., no movement, rotation, or hole creation). Outputs preserve the overall layout structure but simplify by reducing component count.
- **Background and Layout**: The uniform purple background and panel separation (empty purple space) do not interact with any components; they are irrelevant to changes.
- **Unknowns**: 
  - Why only certain small components (same color/size) interact while others do not—possibly depends on exact pixel positions relative to large Dark Red edges/holes, but this cannot be confirmed without pixel-level grid data.
  - No consistent role for semantic shape meanings (e.g., L-shapes, crosses) as interactions; properties like edges or silhouettes do not predictably affect outcomes across examples.

This list captures only the clear, universal connections; no forced or speculative links are included.

[2025-10-03 02:21:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on comparing the input and output lists across all three training examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** puzzle. These are limited to elements that demonstrably affect or are affected by each other (e.g., via changes in pixel count, presence/absence, or other properties). Only properties with 100% consistency across all trains are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., those unchanged or uninvolved) are noted only if they contrast with interactions. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided; unknown aspects (e.g., selection rules) are explicitly called out.

#### 1. **Large Dark Red Component (bbox=[0,0,15,15]) Interaction with Select Small Non-Dark Red Components**
   - **Description**: In every training example, the large Dark Red component (the dominant filled region spanning the full grid) interacts with a subset of small components of other colors. These small components disappear entirely from the output, and their pixels are transferred to the large Dark Red component, consistently increasing its pixel count (e.g., +79 in Train 1, +25 in Train 2, +81 in Train 3).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Pixel count of large Dark Red: Always increases (direct effect from absorbed pixels).
     - Presence of select small components: Always removed (they no longer appear as separate entries in outputs).
   - **Involved Components**:
     - Small components of colors including (but not limited to) Yellow, Blue, Light Blue, Pink, Orange, Red, and Maroon. These are typically 1-2 pixel blobs or small clusters (holes=0, pixels=1-2, irregular bboxes).
     - Interaction is not universal—all small components of these colors do not interact (some remain unchanged; see fixed elements below).
   - **Connection Type**: Position and/or spatial relationship (e.g., proximity within the [0,0,15,15] bbox) likely influences selection for interaction, as all grids are 16x16 and non-overlapping. However, the exact selection rule (why specific small components interact while others of the same color/size do not) is unknown and not consistent/identifiable from positions, colors, or other properties alone.
   - **Consistency Note**: This pixel transfer and removal happens in every example, but the number and specific identities of interacting small components vary (e.g., 20+ disappear in Train 1, fewer in Train 2).

#### 2. **No Consistent Effect on Holes in Large Dark Red**
   - The holes property of the large Dark Red (input holes=2-3) changes in some examples (decreases in Train 1 and Train 3) but remains unchanged in others (Train 2: holes=3 → 3). This is not a consistent interaction effect, though it may relate to the pixel additions above when holes are filled. The rule for when/if holes decrease is unknown.

#### 3. **Fixed Elements with No Interactions**
   - These elements appear in every input and output, unchanged in all properties (color, bbox, pixels, holes). They do not interact with the large Dark Red or any other components (no absorption, no changes).
     - **Green Component**: bbox=[0,0,3,3], holes=0, pixels=7. Consistent top-left filled square/cluster; unaffected.
     - **Small Dark Red Component**: bbox=[0,0,2,2], holes=0, pixels=5-6 (minor variation in Train 3 input due to a separate 1-pixel Dark Red at [0,0,0,0] that disappears, but the main small component remains stable). Does not merge with or affect the large Dark Red.

#### Excluded Elements and Non-Interactions
- **Irrelevant or Inconsistent Elements**: Individual small components of the interacting colors (e.g., specific Yellow or Pink blobs) that remain in some outputs but not others show no consistent interaction across all examples. Their presence/absence varies without a clear pattern tying to properties like color, position, edges, holes (all=0), or silhouettes.
- **No Inter-Component Interactions Among Small Colors**: No evidence of small components affecting each other (e.g., no color changes, position shifts, or merges between Yellow → Blue or similar). Changes only involve removal/addition to large Dark Red.
- **No Consistent Transformations Beyond Pixels/Presence**: No reliable changes in bbox, holes (for small components), or other shape properties (e.g., no movement, rotation, or hole creation). Outputs preserve the overall layout structure but simplify by reducing component count.
- **Background and Layout**: The uniform purple background and panel separation (empty purple space) do not interact with any components; they are irrelevant to changes.
- **Unknowns**: 
  - Why only certain small components (same color/size) interact while others do not—possibly depends on exact pixel positions relative to large Dark Red edges/holes, but this cannot be confirmed without pixel-level grid data.
  - No consistent role for semantic shape meanings (e.g., L-shapes, crosses) as interactions; properties like edges or silhouettes do not predictably affect outcomes across examples.

This list captures only the clear, universal connections; no forced or speculative links are included.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 02:45:04] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 16x16 grid where numbers 0-9 represent colored pixels (likely with 7 as a background or "dark red" color), and the goal is to process the grid by selectively filling certain small, isolated connected components of non-7 pixels with 7 to remove noise or "absorbed blobs," while preserving larger structures, fixed elements (e.g., green components or specific shapes), and avoiding over-filling that alters intended features.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 4-connectivity for connected components of non-7 cells to identify blobs or objects.
 * Small components (e.g., noise or artifacts) should be absorbed into 7, but the size threshold (e.g., <=2 pixels) may be incorrect or context-dependent; some small blobs are filled in expected outputs, while others (possibly touching borders or specific colors) are preserved.
 * Preserve larger components (e.g., green areas, which are not small) and fixed elements like structural bars or shapes; do not absorb everything non-7.
 * Subtle changes occur beyond simple absorption: in some cases, positions that were 7 in input become non-7 in expected (e.g., revealing or adjusting pixels), or specific small blobs are not filled if they form part of a larger pattern/key.
 * Bbox checks (e.g., inside 0-15) are always true on a 16x16 grid and unhelpful; focus on component size, isolation, and possibly color (numbers) uniformity.
 * Grids have vertical/horizontal structures (e.g., left columns with 3s or 7s), and absorption seems targeted at "floating" small blobs not connected to main objects.
 * Expected outputs often expand 7 areas in lower/mid sections but retain or adjust upper blobs; over-absorption can change intended pixels (e.g., turning a key pixel to 7 when it should stay).
 * Consider color-specific rules: numbers like 0 might be neutral/background variants, while others (1-6,8,9) are distinct objects; 7 is dominant background.
 * Border-touching components might be preserved differently; some small components in expected are filled only if fully enclosed.
 * No rotation, shifting, or complex math observed—just selective filling and possible minor adjustments for puzzle "cleaning."

    max_r = max(r for r, c in component)

    max_c = max(c for r, c in component)
    return 0 <= min_r <= max_r <= 15 and 0 <= min_c <= max_c <= 15
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt focused on absorbing small (<=2 pixel) non-7 components into 7 using 4-connectivity, with preservation of larger elements; get_non_seven_components is helpful for blob extraction but overall logic failed all training examples.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and processes some small isolated blobs (e.g., partial filling in mid-sections of train1 and train2), and preserves large components like potential green areas.
 * What didn't work: Over-absorbs or under-absorbs—e.g., in train1, generated sets position (0,0) to 7 (should be 4), fails to fill lower blobs like row7 col14-15 (0,0 should be 7s but generated keeps them), and leaves row2 col13-15 as 0,4,0 (should be 7s); mismatches in rows 6-16 where expected has more uniform 7s in mid-right but generated retains scattered non-7s.
 * In train2, generated sets row0 col1 to 7 (should be 9), fails to fill small blobs in rows 12-15 (e.g., row12 col15=0 should be 7, but generated keeps it), and incorrectly fills row15 entirely to 7s (expected keeps some 0s in col11-15); under-fills upper left blobs.
 * In train3, generated keeps too many small blobs (e.g., row1 col9-15 as 0,8,0,... should be mostly 7s), sets row0 col1 to 7 (should be 6), and fails to fill mid components like row5 col1-5 (0s should be 7s); over-preserves scattered 0s in lower rows.
 * component_bbox_inside_large is unhelpful/broken (always true, adds no value—avoid in future).
 * is_small_component threshold too strict; misses that some "small" components in expected are filled differently based on enclosure or color.
 * preserve_fixed_elements does nothing useful (just returns input—redundant).
 * absorb_small_components core idea is partially right (noise removal) but lacks subtlety like color checks or border rules; leads to mismatches in all cases.
 * No extraction of specific objects (e.g., by color) attempted, which may be needed for distinguishing absorbable vs. preserved blobs.
 * Train1: Generated has extra non-7s in lower half (e.g., row11 col0-15 scattered 0s/1s kept, should be more 7s) and wrong top-left adjustment.
 * Train2: Mismatches top row (7 vs. 9 at (0,1)) and bottom rows (over-fills row15 to all 7s, expected retains 8,0,0,0,0).
 * Train3: Keeps too many upper/mid small components (e.g., row1 col7-15 non-7s vs. expected 7s), unknown reason for partial fills.
 * Overall, attempt shows basic understanding of components but poor matching; differences are specific pixel changes (e.g., 7->non-7 or vice versa) without clear pattern.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains many scattered small non-7 components (e.g., row1 col6-15: 0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,7 should likely be more 7s based on training patterns of filling isolated blobs), over-preserves upper left (e.g., row1 col2=5, row2 col1=4 kept, but expected likely fills to 7 like train3 upper), and leaves lower right noisy (e.g., row12 col13=9, row13 col9=8 kept as small blobs, probably should absorb to 7). 
 * It fails to uniform-ize mid sections (e.g., row6-10 col6-9 have mixed 0s/non-7s, expected would fill small ones per training). 
 * Looks like partial absorption happened (e.g., some 7 expansions in row4-5), but inconsistencies (e.g., row7 col1=8 kept) suggest wrong threshold or no color/object distinction; does not make sense as a "cleaned" puzzle grid compared to expected training patterns of broader 7 fills in enclosed areas.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 02:51:13] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 02:52:23] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of **only the obvious and consistent interconnections or interactions** observed across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or connect to each other in every case (e.g., via position, color, pixel count, holes, or bbox overlap/adjacency leading to transformation). I ignored:
- Irrelevant or static elements with no observed interaction (e.g., purple background fills entire canvas unchanged; individual color names like "Yellow" or "Pink" without consistent transformation ties).
- Inconsistent elements (e.g., hole counts in large Dark Red vary and do not reliably interact; specific small color positions do not consistently persist or transform across all examples).
- High-level patterns or total solutions (no attempt to explain the full puzzle logic).
- Forced connections (e.g., no semantic meanings like "mirroring" or "completion" are assumed, as they are not directly observable in properties).

If a transformation cannot be fully explained via consistent properties (e.g., exact selection criteria for absorption), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Large Dark Red component ([0,0,15,15]) ↔ Small colored pixel components (1-2 pixel clusters of non-Dark Red colors)**:
   - **Interaction**: Pixel count of large Dark Red consistently increases in output (train1: +79; train2: +25; train3: +81). This correlates directly with a consistent reduction in the total pixel count and number of small colored components (e.g., many 1-pixel items disappear entirely). Bbox overlap or adjacency between small colored pixels and the large Dark Red's bbox is observed in inputs, leading to absorption (small components' pixels are added to large Dark Red).
   - **Properties involved**: Pixel count (small → large transfer); bbox position (small pixels within or adjacent to [0,0,15,15] are affected); color (non-Dark Red small clusters transform to Dark Red).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every train pair; no exceptions. Exact criteria for which small pixels are absorbed (vs. preserved) is unknown, but the net effect on pixel counts is consistent.

2. **Small top-left Dark Red component ([0,0,2,2], 5-6 pixels) ↔ Green component ([0,0,3,3], 7 pixels)**:
   - **Interaction**: Bbox overlap between the two (both start at [0,0] with partial spatial intersection). Neither changes in output (bbox, pixels, holes remain fixed across all inputs/outputs).
   - **Properties involved**: Bbox position (consistent overlap); pixel count (no transfer or alteration); color (both remain Dark Red and Green, no transformation).
   - **Consistency**: Overlap and stability occur in every train pair; they do not affect other components but are interconnected via fixed positional relationship.

3. **Large Dark Red component ([0,0,15,15]) ↔ Overall holes property**:
   - **Interaction**: Holes in large Dark Red sometimes decrease in output (train1: 2→0; train3: 3→2), but not always (train2: 3→3). This loosely ties to absorption of small components, potentially filling holes, but the change is not predictable or consistent in direction/magnitude.
   - **Properties involved**: Hole count (possible reduction via pixel absorption); bbox (enclosing structure unchanged).
   - **Consistency**: Present in all, but effect is inconsistent (sometimes changes, sometimes not); transformation rule unknown.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-color effects like "Yellow → Orange" across all; no consistent position-to-transformation like "y=12 always removed"; preserved small pixels vary too much). For the test input, the same interconnections apply based on its structure (e.g., it has a large Dark Red [0,0,5,15] and [9,0,15,15] with small colored pixels nearby, plus the fixed Green [0,0,3,3], suggesting potential absorption similar to trains, but exact output unknown without solving).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 02:52:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of **only the obvious and consistent interconnections or interactions** observed across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or connect to each other in every case (e.g., via position, color, pixel count, holes, or bbox overlap/adjacency leading to transformation). I ignored:
- Irrelevant or static elements with no observed interaction (e.g., purple background fills entire canvas unchanged; individual color names like "Yellow" or "Pink" without consistent transformation ties).
- Inconsistent elements (e.g., hole counts in large Dark Red vary and do not reliably interact; specific small color positions do not consistently persist or transform across all examples).
- High-level patterns or total solutions (no attempt to explain the full puzzle logic).
- Forced connections (e.g., no semantic meanings like "mirroring" or "completion" are assumed, as they are not directly observable in properties).

If a transformation cannot be fully explained via consistent properties (e.g., exact selection criteria for absorption), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Large Dark Red component ([0,0,15,15]) ↔ Small colored pixel components (1-2 pixel clusters of non-Dark Red colors)**:
   - **Interaction**: Pixel count of large Dark Red consistently increases in output (train1: +79; train2: +25; train3: +81). This correlates directly with a consistent reduction in the total pixel count and number of small colored components (e.g., many 1-pixel items disappear entirely). Bbox overlap or adjacency between small colored pixels and the large Dark Red's bbox is observed in inputs, leading to absorption (small components' pixels are added to large Dark Red).
   - **Properties involved**: Pixel count (small → large transfer); bbox position (small pixels within or adjacent to [0,0,15,15] are affected); color (non-Dark Red small clusters transform to Dark Red).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every train pair; no exceptions. Exact criteria for which small pixels are absorbed (vs. preserved) is unknown, but the net effect on pixel counts is consistent.

2. **Small top-left Dark Red component ([0,0,2,2], 5-6 pixels) ↔ Green component ([0,0,3,3], 7 pixels)**:
   - **Interaction**: Bbox overlap between the two (both start at [0,0] with partial spatial intersection). Neither changes in output (bbox, pixels, holes remain fixed across all inputs/outputs).
   - **Properties involved**: Bbox position (consistent overlap); pixel count (no transfer or alteration); color (both remain Dark Red and Green, no transformation).
   - **Consistency**: Overlap and stability occur in every train pair; they do not affect other components but are interconnected via fixed positional relationship.

3. **Large Dark Red component ([0,0,15,15]) ↔ Overall holes property**:
   - **Interaction**: Holes in large Dark Red sometimes decrease in output (train1: 2→0; train3: 3→2), but not always (train2: 3→3). This loosely ties to absorption of small components, potentially filling holes, but the change is not predictable or consistent in direction/magnitude.
   - **Properties involved**: Hole count (possible reduction via pixel absorption); bbox (enclosing structure unchanged).
   - **Consistency**: Present in all, but effect is inconsistent (sometimes changes, sometimes not); transformation rule unknown.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-color effects like "Yellow → Orange" across all; no consistent position-to-transformation like "y=12 always removed"; preserved small pixels vary too much). For the test input, the same interconnections apply based on its structure (e.g., it has a large Dark Red [0,0,5,15] and [9,0,15,15] with small colored pixels nearby, plus the fixed Green [0,0,3,3], suggesting potential absorption similar to trains, but exact output unknown without solving).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 03:20:43] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 03:21:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of a Python program with a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs, likely involving object extraction, pattern recognition, or manipulation for training examples and a test case. The goal is to produce correct outputs that match expected puzzle rules, but the previous attempt failed entirely due to structural issues in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a 'program' function, as this is the entry point expected by the evaluator; without it, all runs fail with errors.
 * Puzzle likely involves grids (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual elements like objects, blobs, holes, or dividers, requiring extraction and analysis to determine outputs like shapes, counts, or omissions.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases such as incomplete stretches across grids, mismatched shapes, or specific omission rules (e.g., ignoring objects not matching criteria like hole counts or keys).
 * Ensure outputs for training examples pass without errors before testing; failures indicate basic structural or rule misunderstandings.
 * Consider grid symmetries, blob connectivity, or key components that may not span the entire grid, which could lead to incorrect extractions.
 * All attempts must mentally simulate puzzle rules (e.g., object detection, counting features) on inputs to verify outputs, noting differences explicitly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions identified from previous attempts, as all code failed structurally.
# Potential future tool: A basic grid parser to avoid structural errors.
def parse_grid(input_str: str) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Placeholder: Convert string or raw input to grid format.
    lines = input_str.strip().split('\n')
    return [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines if line.strip()]
```

```python
# Essential: The required 'program' function skeleton to prevent errors.
def program(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    # Process grid here (e.g., extract objects, apply rules).
    # Return the puzzle output as a string.
    return "processed_output"
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating a complete structural failure in code generation.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated at all, so no partial matches, object extractions, or rule applications could be evaluated.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the code requirements, as even basic function definition was missing.
 * No helpful functions were produced; any attempted code (not shown) is irrelevant or broken due to lacking the core 'program' function.
 * Subtle issue: Without the 'program' function, no mental simulation or rule application could occur, blocking all progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates no processing happened at all.
 * Expected test output should be a valid puzzle result (e.g., a string describing extracted objects or a pattern match), but this error means the program couldn't run, missing all key elements like object detection or rule-based output.
 * This failure highlights the need to prioritize code structure; without it, test cases can't be handled, regardless of puzzle rules.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 03:21:42] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on a direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in the output relative to the input, with the same pattern holding in every case. I focused only on elements with clear, repeatable effects (e.g., transformations like pixel count changes or removals). Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., the purple background, which shows no changes or interactions) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., hole count changes in the large Dark Red, which vary unpredictably—sometimes decreasing, staying the same, or not applicable) are noted as unknown where relevant but not forced into explanations. No high-level puzzle solution or assumptions about unobservable semantics (e.g., "flood fill" or movement) are included. Positions are referenced via bbox for precision.

#### 1. **Large Dark Red Component (bbox=[0,0,15,15], high pixel count, holes varying) ↔ Small Colored Pixel Clusters (multiple, bbox typically 1x1 or small, pixels=1-7, colors: Red/Orange/Yellow/Green/Blue/Light Blue/Pink/Maroon)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Absorption/Transformation (removal + pixel aggregation).
   - **Description**: In every train example, 5-10 small colored pixel clusters (non-Dark Red) are removed entirely in the output. Simultaneously, the large Dark Red's pixel count consistently increases (e.g., +79 in Train 1, +25 in Train 2, +81 in Train 3). The increase correlates with the total pixel count of the removed small clusters (exact aggregation rule unknown). Removed clusters are typically internal or mid-canvas (e.g., bbox with x/y 3-12), while some edge-adjacent small clusters persist unaffected.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Small clusters: Existence (removed) → affects large Dark Red pixel count (+ increase).
     - Large Dark Red: Pixel count → increases based on removed small cluster pixels.
   - **Consistency Note**: This bidirectional effect (small → large pixel gain; large "covers" small via removal) occurs in all examples. No color-specific pattern (any non-Dark Red color can be removed). Hole count change in large Dark Red is unknown (inconsistent: decreases in Trains 1 and 3, unchanged in Train 2).

#### 2. **Small Top-Left Dark Red Component (bbox=[0,0,2,2], pixels=5-6, holes=0) ↔ Green Component (bbox=[0,0,3,3], pixels=7, holes=0)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional Overlap/Stability (no transformation).
   - **Description**: These two components have overlapping bboxes (both start at [0,0] and span early rows/columns). In every train example, both remain completely unchanged in the output (same bbox, pixels, holes, color). Their proximity suggests a positional connection that prevents removal or alteration, even as nearby small colored clusters (e.g., at [0,2]) are sometimes affected by the large Dark Red.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position (bbox overlap in top-left corner) → stability (no pixel count change or removal for either).
   - **Consistency Note**: Identical preservation in all examples; minor pixel variation in small Dark Red (5 vs. 6) but unchanged within each pair.

#### 3. **Edge Single-Pixel Components (bbox=[x,y,x,y] where x or y is 0, 14, or 15; pixels=1, holes=0; colors varying: Blue/Pink/Orange/Red/Yellow/Maroon/Light Blue) ↔ Large Dark Red Component (bbox=[0,0,15,15])**
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional Exemption (persistence despite proximity).
   - **Description**: In every train example, 4-8 single-pixel components located strictly on the canvas edges (left: x=0; top: y=0; right: x=14-15; bottom: y=14-15) are preserved unchanged in the output, even when internal small clusters are removed. These do not affect the large Dark Red's pixel count (no absorption observed). Examples include [14,8] Blue (Train 1), [14,14] Blue (Train 2), [15,7] Pink (Train 3).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position (edge bbox) → exemption from removal/transformation by large Dark Red.
   - **Consistency Note**: Edge position consistently protects these from the large Dark Red's absorption effect seen in internal components. Color and exact count vary, but the positional rule holds across all examples.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Elements
- **Hole Count in Large Dark Red**: Changes inconsistently (e.g., 2→0 in Train 1; 3→3 in Train 2; 3→2 in Train 3). Possible interaction with small cluster positions or counts, but no clear, repeatable pattern across all examples—cannot explain transformation.
- **Color Swaps or Specific Shape Properties (e.g., asymmetric patterns in clusters)**: No consistent color-to-color transformations or effects from holes/edges/silhouettes on movement or other properties. Some clusters have pixels>1 (e.g., 2-7), but this does not predictably affect interactions.
- **Black Rectangular Blocks**: Mentioned in description but absent from component lists; no observable interactions or changes.
- **Other Small Components (e.g., mid-canvas multi-pixel clusters like [10,2,10,3] Yellow pixels=2 in Test Input 1)**: In trains, some persist (e.g., [7,4] Pink in Train 1), but no consistent rule tying them to other elements beyond the large Dark Red exemption for edges.

These are the only connections that are directly observable, consistent in every train example, and involve clear effects (e.g., removal, pixel increase, preservation). No forced assumptions about unlisted interactions (e.g., canvas-wide effects from purple background). The test input was not analyzed for new patterns, as the task focuses on trains for consistency.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 03:23:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on a direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or transform each other in the output relative to the input, with the same pattern holding in every case. I focused only on elements with clear, repeatable effects (e.g., transformations like pixel count changes or removals). Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., the purple background, which shows no changes or interactions) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., hole count changes in the large Dark Red, which vary unpredictably—sometimes decreasing, staying the same, or not applicable) are noted as unknown where relevant but not forced into explanations. No high-level puzzle solution or assumptions about unobservable semantics (e.g., "flood fill" or movement) are included. Positions are referenced via bbox for precision.

#### 1. **Large Dark Red Component (bbox=[0,0,15,15], high pixel count, holes varying) ↔ Small Colored Pixel Clusters (multiple, bbox typically 1x1 or small, pixels=1-7, colors: Red/Orange/Yellow/Green/Blue/Light Blue/Pink/Maroon)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Absorption/Transformation (removal + pixel aggregation).
   - **Description**: In every train example, 5-10 small colored pixel clusters (non-Dark Red) are removed entirely in the output. Simultaneously, the large Dark Red's pixel count consistently increases (e.g., +79 in Train 1, +25 in Train 2, +81 in Train 3). The increase correlates with the total pixel count of the removed small clusters (exact aggregation rule unknown). Removed clusters are typically internal or mid-canvas (e.g., bbox with x/y 3-12), while some edge-adjacent small clusters persist unaffected.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Small clusters: Existence (removed) → affects large Dark Red pixel count (+ increase).
     - Large Dark Red: Pixel count → increases based on removed small cluster pixels.
   - **Consistency Note**: This bidirectional effect (small → large pixel gain; large "covers" small via removal) occurs in all examples. No color-specific pattern (any non-Dark Red color can be removed). Hole count change in large Dark Red is unknown (inconsistent: decreases in Trains 1 and 3, unchanged in Train 2).

#### 2. **Small Top-Left Dark Red Component (bbox=[0,0,2,2], pixels=5-6, holes=0) ↔ Green Component (bbox=[0,0,3,3], pixels=7, holes=0)**
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional Overlap/Stability (no transformation).
   - **Description**: These two components have overlapping bboxes (both start at [0,0] and span early rows/columns). In every train example, both remain completely unchanged in the output (same bbox, pixels, holes, color). Their proximity suggests a positional connection that prevents removal or alteration, even as nearby small colored clusters (e.g., at [0,2]) are sometimes affected by the large Dark Red.
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position (bbox overlap in top-left corner) → stability (no pixel count change or removal for either).
   - **Consistency Note**: Identical preservation in all examples; minor pixel variation in small Dark Red (5 vs. 6) but unchanged within each pair.

#### 3. **Edge Single-Pixel Components (bbox=[x,y,x,y] where x or y is 0, 14, or 15; pixels=1, holes=0; colors varying: Blue/Pink/Orange/Red/Yellow/Maroon/Light Blue) ↔ Large Dark Red Component (bbox=[0,0,15,15])**
   - **Interaction Type**: Positional Exemption (persistence despite proximity).
   - **Description**: In every train example, 4-8 single-pixel components located strictly on the canvas edges (left: x=0; top: y=0; right: x=14-15; bottom: y=14-15) are preserved unchanged in the output, even when internal small clusters are removed. These do not affect the large Dark Red's pixel count (no absorption observed). Examples include [14,8] Blue (Train 1), [14,14] Blue (Train 2), [15,7] Pink (Train 3).
   - **Affected Properties**:
     - Position (edge bbox) → exemption from removal/transformation by large Dark Red.
   - **Consistency Note**: Edge position consistently protects these from the large Dark Red's absorption effect seen in internal components. Color and exact count vary, but the positional rule holds across all examples.

#### Unknown/Non-Consistent Elements
- **Hole Count in Large Dark Red**: Changes inconsistently (e.g., 2→0 in Train 1; 3→3 in Train 2; 3→2 in Train 3). Possible interaction with small cluster positions or counts, but no clear, repeatable pattern across all examples—cannot explain transformation.
- **Color Swaps or Specific Shape Properties (e.g., asymmetric patterns in clusters)**: No consistent color-to-color transformations or effects from holes/edges/silhouettes on movement or other properties. Some clusters have pixels>1 (e.g., 2-7), but this does not predictably affect interactions.
- **Black Rectangular Blocks**: Mentioned in description but absent from component lists; no observable interactions or changes.
- **Other Small Components (e.g., mid-canvas multi-pixel clusters like [10,2,10,3] Yellow pixels=2 in Test Input 1)**: In trains, some persist (e.g., [7,4] Pink in Train 1), but no consistent rule tying them to other elements beyond the large Dark Red exemption for edges.

These are the only connections that are directly observable, consistent in every train example, and involve clear effects (e.g., removal, pixel increase, preservation). No forced assumptions about unlisted interactions (e.g., canvas-wide effects from purple background). The test input was not analyzed for new patterns, as the task focuses on trains for consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 03:49:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 16x16 grid of integer values representing colored pixels, where the goal is to process the grid by absorbing certain connected components of non-7 pixels (likely non-dark-red elements) into 7, while preserving specific components that touch borders, are single pixels on edges, or are in special regions like the top-left, based on rules inferred from training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule 1: Absorb internal (non-border-touching) connected components of non-7 pixels into 7; components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right), and only non-7 pixels are considered part of a component—7 acts as a barrier.
 * Core rule 2: Preserve small components in the top-left area (e.g., 4x4 region) even if internal, possibly due to overlapping bounding boxes of dark red (7) and green (or other colors) elements; this prevents over-absorption in that zone.
 * Core rule 3: Preserve single-pixel non-7 components on the canvas borders (rows 0/15 or columns 0/15), but absorb internal single pixels; also, preserve larger border-touching components entirely.
 * Subtlety: Components touching any border pixel must be fully preserved (not absorbed), even if mostly internal; the find_component function correctly tracks this via touches_border flag.
 * Subtlety: The absorption happens only for components where all pixels are non-7 and the entire component doesn't touch the border; 7 pixels are not part of any component and block connectivity.
 * Easy to miss: Edge singles are checked after absorption, but the code's preserve_edge_singles also absorbs internal singles redundantly—order matters, as absorption should precede edge preservation.
 * Easy to miss: Top-left preservation is a no-op in the code (just a pass), but examples show top-left patterns remain unchanged, suggesting the absorption rule alone might handle it if components there touch implicit borders or are special.
 * Consideration: Grids have scattered non-7 pixels forming "objects" or clusters; expected outputs show some internal clusters absorbed (turned to 7) while border-connected or special ones stay.
 * Consideration: No diagonal connectivity—only orthogonal neighbors.
 * Potential issue: The code runs absorption first, then top-left (no-op), then edge singles, but examples suggest more nuanced preservation, like not absorbing certain multi-pixel internal groups if they are "small" or in specific positions.
 * From examples: In training 1, bottom rows have preserved patterns (e.g., row 11 has 0s preserved differently); in training 2, a large central structure is partially preserved with specific colors; in training 3, upper components are absorbed more aggressively in generated vs. expected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from collections import deque

def is_border(i: int, j: int, n: int = 16) -> bool:
    return i == 0 or i == n - 1 or j == 0 or j == n - 1

def get_neighbors(i: int, j: int, n: int = 16) -> List[tuple]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n:
            neighbors.append((ni, nj))
    return neighbors

def find_component(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, visited: List[List[bool]], n: int) -> tuple:
    component = []
    touches_border = is_border(i, j, n)
    q = deque([(i, j)])
    visited[i][j] = True
    component.append((i, j))
    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()
        for nx, ny in get_neighbors(x, y, n):
            if not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] != 7:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
                component.append((nx, ny))
                if is_border(nx, ny, n):
                    touches_border = True
    return component, touches_border
```
These functions are helpful for identifying connected components and checking border touches using BFS; they correctly model 4-connectivity and ignore 7s.

```python
def absorb_internal_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Handles rule 1: Absorb internal small colored pixel clusters into large dark red by setting non-border-touching non-7 components to 7."""
    n = len(grid)
    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if result[i][j] != 7 and not visited[i][j]:
                component, touches_border = find_component(result, i, j, visited, n)
                if not touches_border:
                    for x, y in component:
                        result[x][y] = 7
    return result
```
This is helpful for the core absorption logic but may over-absorb if not combined with other rules.

The preserve_top_left_overlap and preserve_edge_singles functions are partially helpful but flawed: top-left is a no-op (unhelpful as-is), and edge singles redundantly absorbs internals without fully preserving multi-pixel border components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt models connected components and border touches correctly but fails all training examples due to over-absorption of certain internal or semi-internal clusters.
 * Train 1: Generated absorbs too much in bottom rows (e.g., row 11 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0]—extra 0s and 1 preserved incorrectly; row 12 has [9,5,0,9,0,0,8,6,7,9,0,0,8,7,6,0] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,0,0,8,7,6,0]—extra non-7s like 9,5,0 absorbed incorrectly into 7s).
 * Train 2: Generated absorbs almost everything except top-left and some bottom (e.g., rows 1-4 partially correct but row 1 has no [0,0,0,7] pattern; entire central structure in expected rows 1-7 is missing, replaced by 7s—fails to preserve a large border-touching? component).
 * Train 3: Generated preserves too many scattered pixels in upper/mid grid (e.g., row 1 has [1,7,7,3,...0,0,0,5,0,0,0] vs. expected all 7s after top-left; row 5 has [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,5,0] vs. expected mostly 7s with a separate structure starting row 6—over-preserves small internal clusters).
 * Missed full preservation of multi-pixel components that touch borders indirectly or via chains.
 * preserve_top_left_overlap is unhelpful (no-op, doesn't enforce anything).
 * preserve_edge_singles is partially helpful but broken: it checks singles post-absorption but doesn't prevent absorption of border-touching multi-pixel groups earlier; also absorbs internal singles redundantly.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond components, but find_component could be extended to list all components for debugging.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of absorption but misses nuances like preserving non-single border components and specific patterns in examples (e.g., unknown reason for row 11 differences in train 1—possibly special rule for bottom-edge clusters).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it preserves too many internal non-7 pixels (e.g., scattered 0s,1s, etc. in columns 6-9 and rows 6-15 remain as a loose structure, but expected likely absorbs most internals while keeping top-left [7,2,7,3...], the 3-square in row 3, and border touches like row 5 col 0=9).
 * It fails to absorb central/internal clusters (e.g., the vertical line of 0s in col 6 rows 0-5 should likely be absorbed if not border-touching, but stays; bottom rows have preserved 0s/1s/5s that may need absorption if internal).
 * Compared to training patterns, it over-preserves like in train 3 (scattered pixels stay), suggesting the program doesn't fully implement border-only preservation.
 * To handle test, need to ensure only border-touching components (including multi-pixel) stay, absorb all else, and check for top-left/edge specials—current output has too many non-7s in mid-grid.

[2025-10-03 03:49:38] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on consistent patterns across all three train input/output pairs, the following components and properties show clear, repeatable interactions or effects. Only elements with evidence of interaction (e.g., one affecting the state of another) in **every** example are included. Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., background purple/magenta field, which never changes or interacts) and inconsistent effects (e.g., hole count changes in large Dark Red, which decrease in some cases but not others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle logic or total solution is inferred or provided. Unknown aspects (e.g., precise positional thresholds for interaction) are noted as such.

#### Components Involved
- **Large Dark Red component**: A multi-pixel structure (bbox consistently [0,0,15,15], holes variable but often >0 in inputs, pixels 100+, dominant in all examples).
- **Small colored components**: Discrete clusters (mostly 1-2 pixels, various colors: Blue, Light Blue, Yellow, Pink, Orange, Red, Maroon; bbox varies but small [x,y,x,y] or slight spans; holes=0). These are not a single type but a group defined by their interaction behavior.
- **Fixed small Dark Red component**: A small block (bbox consistently [0,0,2,2], pixels=5-6, holes=0). Included only because it consistently coexists without interaction.
- **Fixed Green component**: A small block (bbox consistently [0,0,3,3], pixels=7, holes=0). Included only because it consistently coexists without interaction.

(Note: No other components, such as black voids, show interactions. In the test input, multiple Dark Red components appear, but trains show only one large + one small; interaction consistency is based on trains only.)

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These occur in every train pair: some small colored components disappear from the output list, while the large Dark Red's pixel count increases by an amount matching the total pixels of the disappeared components (e.g., +79 in train 1, +25 in train 2, +81 in train 3). Remaining small colored components are unchanged. No movement, color shifts, or new components appear.

1. **Small colored components (Blue/Light Blue/Yellow/Pink/Orange/Red/Maroon) ↔ Large Dark Red (absorption based on position)**:
   - **Effect on large Dark Red**: Pixel count increases by the exact sum of pixels from absorbed small colored components. (Consistent in all examples; no other properties of large Dark Red consistently change.)
   - **Effect on small colored components**: Absorbed ones (subset based on position) are fully removed (disappear from output list). Non-absorbed ones remain identical (same color, bbox, pixels, holes=0).
   - **Interconnected properties**: Position (bbox of small component relative to large Dark Red's bbox/shape) determines absorption (e.g., some positions lead to removal and pixel addition to large Dark Red; consistent positional dependency observed, as not all small components absorb equally in each example). Pixel count of small component directly adds to large Dark Red's pixel count upon absorption.
   - **Unknown**: Exact positional rule (e.g., adjacency, enclosure in holes, or distance threshold) for which small components absorb vs. remain; cannot be determined from data without forcing inconsistent explanations.

2. **Small colored components → No effect on fixed small Dark Red or Green**:
   - Fixed small Dark Red and Green components remain completely unchanged (same bbox, pixels, holes, color) in every output, regardless of small colored component positions or absorptions. No pixel transfer, removal, or positional interaction occurs.
   - **Interconnected properties**: None direct; their fixed presence contrasts with the absorption interaction above, implying no position/pixel/hole dependency on other components.

3. **Large Dark Red → No effect on fixed small Dark Red or Green**:
   - Growth (pixel increase) of large Dark Red does not affect the fixed small Dark Red or Green in any way (no overlap, absorption, or positional shift). They coexist separately in all outputs.
   - **Interconnected properties**: Position (fixed top-left overlap in bbox with large Dark Red, but no merging); their separation is consistent despite large Dark Red's expansion.

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color effects like Yellow → Blue, hole count → color, or multi-pixel small components behaving differently) are consistent across all examples. Some small components have >1 pixel (e.g., Red pixels=2), but they follow the same absorption rules as 1-pixel ones.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 03:52:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle task where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects, blobs, or patterns) to produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The puzzle involves understanding and applying rules to extract, manipulate, or match elements in these grids, but the previous attempt failed at the fundamental level of code structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations (training and test) fail with an error, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Grids are represented as lists of lists of integers (e.g., List[List[int]]), likely encoding visual features like colors, shapes, holes, or boundaries that need to be parsed into higher-level puzzle elements.
 * Puzzle rules probably involve identifying and extracting "objects" or "blobs" (connected components), counting features like holes, and applying transformations or matches based on keys or patterns—subtleties include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or components that don't span the full grid.
 * Outputs must match expected results exactly for training examples (which are not shown here but implied to be specific grid manipulations) and the test input; mismatches could stem from incorrect object detection, omission of certain elements, or failure to account for connectivity rules (e.g., 4-connected vs. 8-connected pixels).
 * Consider iterative refinement: mentally simulate grid processing to verify logic, as errors in extraction can propagate to all outputs.
 * All attempts so far show no successful processing, so focus on basic code validity before puzzle-specific logic like hole counting or shape matching.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions, types, or tools were generated in the previous attempt, as the code failed to define the required 'program' function. Future attempts should start with a skeleton like:

```python
def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Placeholder: implement grid processing here
    return grid  # Or transformed output
```

Functions like object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for blobs or hole detection) would be essential but are absent; avoid assuming untested tools without validation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed with the same error: "Generated code does not contain 'program' function," indicating a complete structural failure rather than puzzle logic issues.
 * Nothing worked: no outputs were generated, so no partial credit for logic, extraction, or matching.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the code requirements, let alone the puzzle rules, as it didn't produce any valid program to evaluate.
 * No functions for extracting objects (e.g., identifying blobs, counting holes, or detecting dividers) were included, making the code irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * This is the only attempt referenced, but it highlights the need to prioritize code format over premature puzzle solving.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense as a valid result—it indicates the code couldn't even be executed, so no puzzle processing occurred.
 * Without a proper output, it's impossible to verify if it matches the expected test result (e.g., a transformed grid accounting for objects, holes, or patterns); this is fundamentally different from any expected valid output, which should be a processed grid.
 * The error suggests the test case (an unseen grid) wasn't handled at all, missing all puzzle elements like object extraction or rule application—future attempts must ensure the 'program' function exists to even attempt matching the test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of Python code that defines a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The goal is to analyze grids, extract or manipulate elements according to puzzle rules, and output results that match expected patterns, but the previous attempt failed due to a fundamental structural issue in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must include a 'program' function as the entry point; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of logic.
 * Grids are represented as List[List[int]], where values likely encode visual features (e.g., 0 for empty, positive ints for object types, colors, or shapes).
 * Puzzle rules probably involve identifying and extracting "objects" (connected components or blobs) from the grid, counting features like holes or sizes, and applying transformations or matches to a "key" pattern.
 * Subtle elements: Handle edge cases like disconnected objects, irregular shapes, or grids where objects don't span the full width/height; ensure outputs preserve grid dimensions or format exactly (e.g., no extra spaces or modified boundaries).
 * Outputs should be grids or simplified representations that visually or structurally match expectations, potentially omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching a key criteria like hole count).
 * Consider rotational symmetry, mirroring, or adjacency rules for object validation, as visual puzzles often include these.
 * All training examples and test must pass independently; partial logic won't suffice if the function is missing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

class GridObject:
    def __init__(self, positions: List[tuple], hole_count: int = 0, size: int = 0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples for connected cells
        self.hole_count = hole_count
        self.size = size
```

```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[GridObject]:
    # Flood-fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (objects) in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming 0 is background
                component = dfs(grid, i, j, visited)  # Implement DFS to get positions, count holes
                hole_count = count_holes(component, grid)  # Custom function to detect enclosed zeros
                objects.append(GridObject(component, hole_count, len(component)))
    return objects
```

```python
def count_holes(component: List[tuple], grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Placeholder: Analyze bounding box of component for enclosed empty cells (0s)
    # This is subtle and easy to miss—holes are internal voids, not external spaces
    min_r, max_r = min(p[0] for p in component), max(p[0] for p in component)
    min_c, max_c = min(p[1] for p in component), max(p[1] for p in component)
    internal_zeros = 0
    for r in range(min_r + 1, max_r):  # Skip borders
        for c in range(min_c + 1, max_c):
            if grid[r][c] == 0 and is_enclosed((r, c), component):  # Check if surrounded
                internal_zeros += 1
    return internal_zeros // 4  # Approximate for 4-connected holes; refine based on puzzle
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated program lacked the required 'program' function entirely, causing immediate errors across all training examples and the test input.
 * No object extraction or grid processing logic was present, so nothing worked—complete structural failure.
 * No evidence of understanding grid representation or visual rules; code was invalid Python for the puzzle framework.
 * Function to extract objects wasn't attempted, which is essential for identifying blobs, holes, or matches in visual puzzles.
 * All attempts (only one shown) resulted in the same error, indicating no progress on core requirements.
 * The extract_objects function (not used) would be helpful, but without it, puzzles involving connected components can't be solved.
 * No unhelpful functions were generated, but future attempts should avoid incomplete code skeletons without the 'program' entry point.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not look correct because it indicates a total failure to produce valid, runnable code.
 * No actual output grid or processed result was generated, so it can't be compared to expected puzzle solution (e.g., a transformed grid matching visual rules).
 * This differs from expectations: The test input grid should yield a specific output (e.g., extracted objects or a modified grid omitting invalid elements), but instead, evaluation halted early—likely the expected output involves applying rules like hole counting or shape matching, which wasn't reached.
 * The error persists across all cases, confirming the code doesn't handle any input correctly, including the test's unique grid features (e.g., possibly irregular objects or a key pattern).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of a Python program with a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs, likely involving object extraction, pattern recognition, or manipulation for training examples and a test case. The goal is to produce correct outputs that match expected puzzle rules, but the previous attempt failed entirely due to structural issues in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a 'program' function, as this is the entry point expected by the evaluator; without it, all runs fail with errors.
 * Puzzle likely involves grids (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual elements like objects, blobs, holes, or dividers, requiring extraction and analysis to determine outputs like shapes, counts, or omissions.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases such as incomplete stretches across grids, mismatched shapes, or specific omission rules (e.g., ignoring objects not matching criteria like hole counts or keys).
 * Ensure outputs for training examples pass without errors before testing; failures indicate basic structural or rule misunderstandings.
 * Consider grid symmetries, blob connectivity, or key components that may not span the entire grid, which could lead to incorrect extractions.
 * All attempts must mentally simulate puzzle rules (e.g., object detection, counting features) on inputs to verify outputs, noting differences explicitly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions identified from previous attempts, as all code failed structurally.
# Potential future tool: A basic grid parser to avoid structural errors.
def parse_grid(input_str: str) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Placeholder: Convert string or raw input to grid format.
    lines = input_str.strip().split('\n')
    return [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines if line.strip()]
```

```python
# Essential: The required 'program' function skeleton to prevent errors.
def program(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    # Process grid here (e.g., extract objects, apply rules).
    # Return the puzzle output as a string.
    return "processed_output"
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating a complete structural failure in code generation.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated at all, so no partial matches, object extractions, or rule applications could be evaluated.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the code requirements, as even basic function definition was missing.
 * No helpful functions were produced; any attempted code (not shown) is irrelevant or broken due to lacking the core 'program' function.
 * Subtle issue: Without the 'program' function, no mental simulation or rule application could occur, blocking all progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates no processing happened at all.
 * Expected test output should be a valid puzzle result (e.g., a string describing extracted objects or a pattern match), but this error means the program couldn't run, missing all key elements like object detection or rule-based output.
 * This failure highlights the need to prioritize code structure; without it, test cases can't be handled, regardless of puzzle rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 16x16 grid containing 0s (empty/unfilled cells), 7s (background or wall cells), and numbers 1-9 (likely clues, objects, or barriers). The goal is to produce an output grid by filling certain 0s with 7s to distinguish exterior/unbounded regions from internal enclosed regions, while preserving numbers 1-9 and existing 7s unchanged; internal 0 regions that are fully enclosed (not connected to the border) should remain 0, forming shapes or "rooms" around or between numbered clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s represent traversable empty space for flooding/propagation, but only those connected to the grid border should be filled with 7 (exterior region); disconnected internal 0 clusters must remain 0 to match enclosed areas in expected outputs.
 * Numbers 1-9 act as barriers: the flood cannot pass through or over them (they block adjacency for 0-paths), and they remain unchanged in the output.
 * 7s are pre-filled background/walls: they block flooding (cannot traverse them) but may influence starting points for the fill.
 * Subtlety: Defining "connected to border" is critical and tricky—simple adjacency via 0-paths to border 0s may miss regions adjacent only to border 7s or border numbers; conversely, over-seeding from border 7s can incorrectly fill internal regions by treating border-adjacent 0s as exterior even if isolated internally.
 * The grid borders themselves may contain 0s, 7s, or numbers, complicating seeding: if a border cell is a number, adjacent internal 0s might need filling if considered exterior, but this risks over-filling.
 * No diagonal movement: flooding uses 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).
 * Multiple disconnected 0 regions exist; only the one touching the border gets filled—internal ones stay 0, often forming blob-like shapes in expected outputs (e.g., surrounding numbers without touching borders).
 * Potential for 2x2 or larger empty internal areas that must remain 0; over-filling these violates the enclosure rule.
 * The puzzle may involve implicit rules like no touching islands or connected sea, but based on outputs, the core is exterior vs. interior 0 regions.
 * Visually, expected outputs show 0s clustering into enclosed "pockets" (e.g., around numbers in ex2 upper grid, or linear paths in ex1 lower grid), suggesting the fill must precisely avoid crossing number barriers.
 * Copying the grid is essential to avoid mutating the input.
 * Visited tracking prevents revisiting and ensures efficient BFS/DFS flooding.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for safe grid duplication before modification.)

```python
def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # (Current seeding logic, but flawed: starts from border 0 or 7)
    # ... (rest of BFS as in attempt)
    return h
```
(This BFS flood-fill structure is helpful and core to the problem, as it correctly handles 4-dir propagation through 0s and visited tracking; it just needs seeding and enqueue conditions fixed to properly distinguish exterior from interior. Use DFS as alternative if needed for recursion.)

(No other functions like object extraction are present or needed; the problem doesn't require identifying or counting objects around numbers—it's purely about regional filling of 0s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses a BFS flood-fill starting from all border cells that are 0 or 7, propagating only through unvisited 0s and setting them to 7; this partially understands the exterior-filling concept but fails consistently due to incorrect seeding, leading to under-filling in some cases and over-filling in others.
 * In training example 1: Generated under-filled (left 0s remaining) in row 6 (cols 3-6 and 9-10 as 0,0,0,0 and 0,0) and mismatched lower regions (e.g., row 7 has 0s at cols 3-6,9-10,13 but expected has all 7s in row 6 and specific 0s only in lower rows like row 7 cols 14-15, row 9 cols 14-15, row 10 col 15, row 11 cols 8-11,13-15, etc.); upper rows 0-5 mostly match, but the fill didn't reach some exterior 0s (possibly due to number barriers or seeding missing border numbers), while incorrectly leaving internal-adjacent 0s unfilled when expected treats them as exterior.
 * In training example 2: Generated over-filled massively (e.g., row 1 all 7s except numbers, but expected has 0s at cols 6-8 and 12-14; row 2 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols 7-8,13,15? Wait, col15 is 4 in expected? Actually cols 7-8=0,0 and col13=0? No, expected row2: 0s at 6? Wait, [5,7,6,3,7,7,1,0,0,7,7,7,6,0,4,7] so 0s at cols7-8,13; generated has all 7s there), turning most internal 0 clusters to 7 when expected preserves them as enclosed regions (e.g., 0s forming shapes around numbers in rows 1-7 and separate pockets in rows 9-14); this suggests seeding from border 7s incorrectly treated internal components adjacent to background as exterior.
 * In training example 3: Generated over-filled internal areas (e.g., row 5 all 7s except some numbers like 5,9,5 but expected has 0s at cols1-5; row 7 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols1-2? Wait, expected row6: [7,0,0,0,0,0,7,...] so 0s cols1-5, but generated row6? Wait, rows are 0-indexed, generated row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,9,7,5,7] filled to 7s where expected has 0s; lower rows like 9-15 have some 0s filled differently, e.g., row9 generated has 0s at cols9-12 but expected has more structured 0s in cols1-3,4-5?); upper rows 0-3 mostly match, but fill invaded enclosed 0 pockets (e.g., row6-9 expected 0 clusters around numbers, but generated filled them).
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates understanding of BFS for regional filling and barrier handling (numbers/7s not traversed), but misses subtle seeding: including border 7s causes over-filling of near-border internals in ex2/ex3, while failing to fill some exterior 0s in ex1 (possibly because those 0s are only adjacent to border numbers, not enqueued); no object extraction needed, as numbers stay fixed—no counting holes or blobs required.
 * The copy_grid function works correctly and should be retained; fill_exterior_0s is mostly helpful but broken in seeding/enqueue logic (don't use as-is; modify to experiment with seeding only border 0s or all border cells).
 * No unhelpful functions present, but the current enqueue condition (only if h[nr][nc] == 0) is correct—don't change that; the issue is solely in initial queue population.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples; it over-fills some internal 0s (e.g., row 5 has isolated 0 at col1? Wait, row5: [9,0,7,7,...] leaves one 0 but fills around it, while expected likely wants enclosed clusters like in ex3 row5; row6: [7,8,7,0,0,7,...] leaves 0s at cols3-4 but fills others, potentially invading what should be internal pockets similar to ex2's preserved 0 shapes).
 * It under-fills or mismatches in lower rows (e.g., row12: [5,7,7,5,0,7,...] leaves scattered 0s, but training patterns suggest more structured enclosed 0s or full filling of exterior chains); overall, it resembles the over-filling in ex2/ex3 (many 7s with sparse 0s) rather than balanced exterior-only fill, so it likely incorrectly treats some internal regions as exterior due to seeding flaws—e.g., 0s in rows 6-9 cols3-4 seem like a small pocket that might should remain if enclosed, but without exact expected, it doesn't match the "enclosed blobs" subtlety seen in training.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 16x16 grid where numbers 0-9 represent colored pixels (likely with 7 as a background or "dark red" color), and the goal is to process the grid by selectively filling certain small, isolated connected components of non-7 pixels with 7 to remove noise or "absorbed blobs," while preserving larger structures, fixed elements (e.g., green components or specific shapes), and avoiding over-filling that alters intended features.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 4-connectivity for connected components of non-7 cells to identify blobs or objects.
 * Small components (e.g., noise or artifacts) should be absorbed into 7, but the size threshold (e.g., <=2 pixels) may be incorrect or context-dependent; some small blobs are filled in expected outputs, while others (possibly touching borders or specific colors) are preserved.
 * Preserve larger components (e.g., green areas, which are not small) and fixed elements like structural bars or shapes; do not absorb everything non-7.
 * Subtle changes occur beyond simple absorption: in some cases, positions that were 7 in input become non-7 in expected (e.g., revealing or adjusting pixels), or specific small blobs are not filled if they form part of a larger pattern/key.
 * Bbox checks (e.g., inside 0-15) are always true on a 16x16 grid and unhelpful; focus on component size, isolation, and possibly color (numbers) uniformity.
 * Grids have vertical/horizontal structures (e.g., left columns with 3s or 7s), and absorption seems targeted at "floating" small blobs not connected to main objects.
 * Expected outputs often expand 7 areas in lower/mid sections but retain or adjust upper blobs; over-absorption can change intended pixels (e.g., turning a key pixel to 7 when it should stay).
 * Consider color-specific rules: numbers like 0 might be neutral/background variants, while others (1-6,8,9) are distinct objects; 7 is dominant background.
 * Border-touching components might be preserved differently; some small components in expected are filled only if fully enclosed.
 * No rotation, shifting, or complex math observed—just selective filling and possible minor adjustments for puzzle "cleaning."

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt focused on absorbing small (<=2 pixel) non-7 components into 7 using 4-connectivity, with preservation of larger elements; get_non_seven_components is helpful for blob extraction but overall logic failed all training examples.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and processes some small isolated blobs (e.g., partial filling in mid-sections of train1 and train2), and preserves large components like potential green areas.
 * What didn't work: Over-absorbs or under-absorbs—e.g., in train1, generated sets position (0,0) to 7 (should be 4), fails to fill lower blobs like row7 col14-15 (0,0 should be 7s but generated keeps them), and leaves row2 col13-15 as 0,4,0 (should be 7s); mismatches in rows 6-16 where expected has more uniform 7s in mid-right but generated retains scattered non-7s.
 * In train2, generated sets row0 col1 to 7 (should be 9), fails to fill small blobs in rows 12-15 (e.g., row12 col15=0 should be 7, but generated keeps it), and incorrectly fills row15 entirely to 7s (expected keeps some 0s in col11-15); under-fills upper left blobs.
 * In train3, generated keeps too many small blobs (e.g., row1 col9-15 as 0,8,0,... should be mostly 7s), sets row0 col1 to 7 (should be 6), and fails to fill mid components like row5 col1-5 (0s should be 7s); over-preserves scattered 0s in lower rows.
 * component_bbox_inside_large is unhelpful/broken (always true, adds no value—avoid in future).
 * is_small_component threshold too strict; misses that some "small" components in expected are filled differently based on enclosure or color.
 * preserve_fixed_elements does nothing useful (just returns input—redundant).
 * absorb_small_components core idea is partially right (noise removal) but lacks subtlety like color checks or border rules; leads to mismatches in all cases.
 * No extraction of specific objects (e.g., by color) attempted, which may be needed for distinguishing absorbable vs. preserved blobs.
 * Train1: Generated has extra non-7s in lower half (e.g., row11 col0-15 scattered 0s/1s kept, should be more 7s) and wrong top-left adjustment.
 * Train2: Mismatches top row (7 vs. 9 at (0,1)) and bottom rows (over-fills row15 to all 7s, expected retains 8,0,0,0,0).
 * Train3: Keeps too many upper/mid small components (e.g., row1 col7-15 non-7s vs. expected 7s), unknown reason for partial fills.
 * Overall, attempt shows basic understanding of components but poor matching; differences are specific pixel changes (e.g., 7->non-7 or vice versa) without clear pattern.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains many scattered small non-7 components (e.g., row1 col6-15: 0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,7 should likely be more 7s based on training patterns of filling isolated blobs), over-preserves upper left (e.g., row1 col2=5, row2 col1=4 kept, but expected likely fills to 7 like train3 upper), and leaves lower right noisy (e.g., row12 col13=9, row13 col9=8 kept as small blobs, probably should absorb to 7). 
 * It fails to uniform-ize mid sections (e.g., row6-10 col6-9 have mixed 0s/non-7s, expected would fill small ones per training). 
 * Looks like partial absorption happened (e.g., some 7 expansions in row4-5), but inconsistencies (e.g., row7 col1=8 kept) suggest wrong threshold or no color/object distinction; does not make sense as a "cleaned" puzzle grid compared to expected training patterns of broader 7 fills in enclosed areas.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 16x16 grid of integer values representing colored pixels, where the goal is to process the grid by absorbing certain connected components of non-7 pixels (likely non-dark-red elements) into 7, while preserving specific components that touch borders, are single pixels on edges, or are in special regions like the top-left, based on rules inferred from training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule 1: Absorb internal (non-border-touching) connected components of non-7 pixels into 7; components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right), and only non-7 pixels are considered part of a component—7 acts as a barrier.
 * Core rule 2: Preserve small components in the top-left area (e.g., 4x4 region) even if internal, possibly due to overlapping bounding boxes of dark red (7) and green (or other colors) elements; this prevents over-absorption in that zone.
 * Core rule 3: Preserve single-pixel non-7 components on the canvas borders (rows 0/15 or columns 0/15), but absorb internal single pixels; also, preserve larger border-touching components entirely.
 * Subtlety: Components touching any border pixel must be fully preserved (not absorbed), even if mostly internal; the find_component function correctly tracks this via touches_border flag.
 * Subtlety: The absorption happens only for components where all pixels are non-7 and the entire component doesn't touch the border; 7 pixels are not part of any component and block connectivity.
 * Easy to miss: Edge singles are checked after absorption, but the code's preserve_edge_singles also absorbs internal singles redundantly—order matters, as absorption should precede edge preservation.
 * Easy to miss: Top-left preservation is a no-op in the code (just a pass), but examples show top-left patterns remain unchanged, suggesting the absorption rule alone might handle it if components there touch implicit borders or are special.
 * Consideration: Grids have scattered non-7 pixels forming "objects" or clusters; expected outputs show some internal clusters absorbed (turned to 7) while border-connected or special ones stay.
 * Consideration: No diagonal connectivity—only orthogonal neighbors.
 * Potential issue: The code runs absorption first, then top-left (no-op), then edge singles, but examples suggest more nuanced preservation, like not absorbing certain multi-pixel internal groups if they are "small" or in specific positions.
 * From examples: In training 1, bottom rows have preserved patterns (e.g., row 11 has 0s preserved differently); in training 2, a large central structure is partially preserved with specific colors; in training 3, upper components are absorbed more aggressively in generated vs. expected.

                    touches_border = True
    return component, touches_border
```
These functions are helpful for identifying connected components and checking border touches using BFS; they correctly model 4-connectivity and ignore 7s.

```python
def absorb_internal_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Handles rule 1: Absorb internal small colored pixel clusters into large dark red by setting non-border-touching non-7 components to 7."""
    n = len(grid)
    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if result[i][j] != 7 and not visited[i][j]:
                component, touches_border = find_component(result, i, j, visited, n)
                if not touches_border:
                    for x, y in component:
                        result[x][y] = 7
    return result
```
This is helpful for the core absorption logic but may over-absorb if not combined with other rules.

The preserve_top_left_overlap and preserve_edge_singles functions are partially helpful but flawed: top-left is a no-op (unhelpful as-is), and edge singles redundantly absorbs internals without fully preserving multi-pixel border components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt models connected components and border touches correctly but fails all training examples due to over-absorption of certain internal or semi-internal clusters.
 * Train 1: Generated absorbs too much in bottom rows (e.g., row 11 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0]—extra 0s and 1 preserved incorrectly; row 12 has [9,5,0,9,0,0,8,6,7,9,0,0,8,7,6,0] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,0,0,8,7,6,0]—extra non-7s like 9,5,0 absorbed incorrectly into 7s).
 * Train 2: Generated absorbs almost everything except top-left and some bottom (e.g., rows 1-4 partially correct but row 1 has no [0,0,0,7] pattern; entire central structure in expected rows 1-7 is missing, replaced by 7s—fails to preserve a large border-touching? component).
 * Train 3: Generated preserves too many scattered pixels in upper/mid grid (e.g., row 1 has [1,7,7,3,...0,0,0,5,0,0,0] vs. expected all 7s after top-left; row 5 has [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,5,0] vs. expected mostly 7s with a separate structure starting row 6—over-preserves small internal clusters).
 * Missed full preservation of multi-pixel components that touch borders indirectly or via chains.
 * preserve_top_left_overlap is unhelpful (no-op, doesn't enforce anything).
 * preserve_edge_singles is partially helpful but broken: it checks singles post-absorption but doesn't prevent absorption of border-touching multi-pixel groups earlier; also absorbs internal singles redundantly.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond components, but find_component could be extended to list all components for debugging.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of absorption but misses nuances like preserving non-single border components and specific patterns in examples (e.g., unknown reason for row 11 differences in train 1—possibly special rule for bottom-edge clusters).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it preserves too many internal non-7 pixels (e.g., scattered 0s,1s, etc. in columns 6-9 and rows 6-15 remain as a loose structure, but expected likely absorbs most internals while keeping top-left [7,2,7,3...], the 3-square in row 3, and border touches like row 5 col 0=9).
 * It fails to absorb central/internal clusters (e.g., the vertical line of 0s in col 6 rows 0-5 should likely be absorbed if not border-touching, but stays; bottom rows have preserved 0s/1s/5s that may need absorption if internal).
 * Compared to training patterns, it over-preserves like in train 3 (scattered pixels stay), suggesting the program doesn't fully implement border-only preservation.
 * To handle test, need to ensure only border-touching components (including multi-pixel) stay, absorb all else, and check for top-left/edge specials—current output has too many non-7s in mid-grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a 16x16 grid-based logic puzzle where input grids contain 0s (empty cells), 7s (pre-filled cells, likely representing "sea" or "exterior" filler), and scattered numbers (1-6, 8, 9 as fixed clues). The goal is to fill certain 0s with 7s based on connectivity rules to determine "exterior" or fillable regions, while leaving other 0s unfilled (likely interior or clue-related regions) and preserving all clue numbers unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s connected via other 0s to any border (top, bottom, left, right) should generally be filled with 7s, treating border 7s as starting points for propagation, but not all border-adjacent 0s are filled (e.g., some interior-touching border 0s remain 0 in expected outputs, suggesting over-simple flood fill overfills).
 * Propagation only through 0s (not through numbers or existing 7s beyond seeding), but seeding must include all four borders; missing bottom/right seeding leads to underfilling in enclosed-but-exterior-connected areas.
 * Clue numbers (1-6, 8, 9) must never be changed to 7; they remain fixed regardless of adjacency to 7s, indicating they define or protect interior regions (e.g., possible island clues in a Nurikabe-like puzzle where 7 is sea and 0s are island spaces).
 * Some interior regions of 0s and numbers are completely filled to 7s in expected outputs (e.g., no remaining 0s or numbers in certain blocks), suggesting rules for identifying "degenerate" or non-protected regions that get fully filled, possibly if they violate enclosure or size rules.
 * Remaining 0s form connected clusters often adjacent to or containing clue numbers, implying 0s in "protected" interior regions (enclosed by 7s) stay unfilled, potentially with subtle rules like no 2x2 0-blocks or region sizes matching clues (e.g., a "1" clue might protect a single adjacent 0 or itself).
 * Existing 7s act as barriers but also as seeds for filling adjacent 0s; interior 7s do not propagate filling unless connected via the flood (but current code doesn't seed interior 7s).
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s aren't always filled (e.g., train2 row1 0s remain 0 despite top-border proximity), so connectivity must consider enclosures created by numbers/7s; overflooding happens if ignoring that some 0s are "internal" even near borders.
 * No diagonal connectivity (only orthogonal, as in code's dirs); all changes are iterative but single-pass flood suffices if seeded correctly.
 * Across attempts, no handling for clue-based filling (e.g., expanding regions from numbers) or validation rules (e.g., ensuring no touching interiors), leading to mismatches in both over- and under-filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `fill_exterior_0s` function is partially helpful as a flood-fill base for exterior 0s but broken (incomplete border seeding leads to underfilling; fix by adding bottom/right border seeding loops similar to top/left). It correctly propagates only through 0s and preserves non-0s.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = 16
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # Start from all four borders: cells that are 0 or 7
    # Top
    for c in range(n):
        if h[0][c] == 0 or h[0][c] == 7:
            q.append((0, c))
            visited[0][c] = True
    # Bottom
    for c in range(n):
        if h[n-1][c] == 0 or h[n-1][c] == 7:
            if not visited[n-1][c]:
                q.append((n-1, c))
                visited[n-1][c] = True
    # Left (skip corners if already visited)
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][0] == 0 or h[r][0] == 7:
            if not visited[r][0]:
                q.append((r, 0))
                visited[r][0] = True
    # Right
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][n-1] == 0 or h[r][n-1] == 7:
            if not visited[r][n-1]:
                q.append((r, n-1))
                visited[r][n-1] = True
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while q:
        r, c = q.popleft()
        if h[r][c] == 0:
            h[r][c] = 7
        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and h[nr][nc] == 0:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                q.append((nr, nc))
    return h
```

No other helpful functions from the attempt; no types or object-extraction tools were used or needed yet (e.g., no need for extracting regions around clues).

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
The `fill_isolated_non7` function is broken and irrelevant: it incorrectly changes fixed clue numbers (non-0 non-7) to 7 based on >=3 adjacent 7s, but expected outputs preserve all clues unchanged. It also doesn't affect 0s and runs in a loop that may over-apply, leading to invalid changes (e.g., in train1 row12, it left some clues but expected filled areas to 7 without changing clues elsewhere). Do not use in future attempts.

```python
def fill_isolated_non7(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:  # Broken: changes clues, ignores 0s, not puzzle-relevant
    # ... (code as provided, but discard)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incomplete flood fill (only top/left borders seeded, causing underfilling of 0s connected via bottom/right, e.g., train1 row6 left as [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,5,7,...] vs. expected all 7s; train3 row12-15 similar underfill of 0s).
 * Overfilling in non-enclosed areas: e.g., train2 row1 0s filled to 7s ([7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,...] generated vs. expected [7,7,7,3,7,7,0,0,0,7,...] with 0s preserved), suggesting border 0s aren't always exterior if part of interior structures.
 * Clue preservation failed indirectly: `fill_isolated_non7` didn't change most clues but was applied after flood, leaving mismatches where entire regions should be 7-filled without altering clues (e.g., train1 row7 generated [7,7,7,0,0,9,0,2,9,0,0,7,...] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,...], where 0s/clues stayed but should have been filled around/nearby).
 * Train1: Underfilled interior 0s (row6, row7 partial, row12 start [9,5,...] vs. expected 7s); overfilled nothing obvious but last two 0s correctly preserved in row7/8.
 * Train2: Severe overfilling of upper 0s (rows1-6 all mostly 7s generated vs. expected with 0-clusters and embedded clues like 1,5,2,6,9,8); lower 0s underfilled due to no right-border seed (row11-13 0s at end left vs. expected preserved as interior).
 * Train3: Underfilled lower 0s (rows12-15 [...,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] patterns vs. expected with some 7-fills but preserved 0-clusters around clues like 9,8,6,1,2); top overfilled slightly (row2 [7,7,8,3,...] but expected [7,7,8,3,...] similar, minor diff in row0 [7,7,7,3,...] vs. [7,6,7,3,...] unknown why 5->7? Wait, likely input diff but code filled adjacent 0s wrong).
 * No extraction of objects/regions (e.g., no function to identify clue-connected 0-clusters), missing for handling interior protections.
 * `fill_isolated_non7` caused no visible changes in most cases (clues had <3 adj 7s post-flood) but is conceptually wrong; remove it.
 * Overall, no handling for why some 0-clusters remain (e.g., enclosure by 7s/numbers) or clue implications (e.g., numbers protecting adjacent 0s from filling).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills some border-adjacent 0s (e.g., row5 [9,0,7,...] likely filled 0 to 7 incorrectly if that 0 is interior-protected like train2) and underfills lower/middle 0-clusters (e.g., rows7-15 have many unfilled 0s around clues like 2,4,1,9,5,6,8, but expected likely preserves some as interior while filling others to 7 based on connectivity/enclosure).
 * Specifically, row6 generated all 7s except scattered, but test input has 0s in row5 col10-15 [9,0,0,0,0,0], likely underfilled due to missing right-border seed (should connect via right if exterior).
 * Middle areas (rows7-9 cols3-15) have 0s preserved around clues (e.g., 2,4,0s), but if connected to bottom/right, they should be 7s per partial rules, yet code leaves them 0—mismatch similar to train1 underfill.
 * Lower rows (12-15) have 0s at ends (e.g., row12 col15=0, row13 col9=1 but adjacent 0s), looking like unfilled interiors, but without full borders seeded, it ignores potential exterior paths; also no clue changes, which is good, but overall too many 0s remain compared to expected patterns in training (e.g., train2 preserves 0-clusters but fills disconnected ones).
 * Does not account for protected 0s near borders (like train2 row1), leading to potential overfill in test's upper 0s (row5-6); unknown if test has enclosed regions with multiple clues (like train2 lower left), but code would fill them wrong without region extraction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where 7 represents barriers or walls, non-7 cells (0-6,8,9) represent open spaces, air, or labeled objects, and the task is to identify connected components of these non-7 cells using 4-way adjacency, then fill (set to 7) only those components that are fully enclosed—specifically, those not touching the top row (row 0) or bottom row (row n-1)—effectively removing "trapped" or floating regions while preserving components connected to the top or bottom (possibly simulating exposure to air or ground).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connectivity is strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only through non-7 cells; diagonal does not count.
 * Components are groups of adjacent non-7 cells; all non-7 values (including numbers 1-9 and 0s) are treated as connectable in the current approach, but this may be a subtlety—numbers 1-9 might represent solid "objects" that should block connectivity for air (0s only) or require special handling to preserve their positions and surrounding 0s if the object touches the bottom.
 * Filling only occurs for components not touching top or bottom rows; components touching either are preserved entirely (including their internal structure of 0s and numbers), which suggests a "grounded" or "exposed" rule where bottom-touching structures (e.g., cave formations or lakes) stay intact.
 * Subtle element: The puzzle likely preserves complex structures (e.g., "islands" or "pockets" with embedded numbers surrounded by 0s) if they touch the bottom, but the current flood fill merges separate structures incorrectly if they are connected through non-7 paths that shouldn't be (e.g., treating numbers as passable air).
 * Easy to miss: Not all enclosed areas are filled—only truly trapped ones; side-touching but bottom-touching components must be preserved, and the program may overfill by not distinguishing between air (0s) and objects (1-9). In expected outputs, preserved areas often have intricate patterns of 0s around numbers, suggesting objects define boundaries rather than being filled themselves.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, reflection, or value modification beyond filling to 7; grid size n=16 in examples; 7s are immutable barriers that block all connectivity and filling.
 * Potential misinterpretation: This isn't simple border flooding (e.g., from all sides); the top/bottom check implies vertical exposure (e.g., air from top, ground from bottom), not full perimeter. Numbers 1-9 are preserved in place in expected outputs, so filling shouldn't overwrite them unless the entire component is trapped.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program includes useful building blocks for component detection and filling, which align with core flood-fill logic.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def is_non_seven(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] != 7
```
(This bounds-checks and identifies traversable non-7 cells; helpful for any connectivity-based approach.)

```python
def touches_top_or_bottom(component: List[tuple], n: int) -> bool:
    for x, y in component:
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
            return True
    return False
```
(This correctly identifies exposure to top/bottom; essential for the enclosure rule, though may need extension to preserve side/bottom structures.)

```python
def flood_component(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[tuple]:
    component = []
    q = deque([(x, y)])
    visited[x][y] = True
    while q:
        cx, cy = q.popleft()
        component.append((cx, cy))
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_non_seven(nx, ny, g, n) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return component
```
(This performs accurate 4-way BFS flood fill to extract components; very helpful and not broken—reuse it, but consider modifying is_non_seven to only traverse 0s if numbers are solid.)

The main program function integrates these well for iteration and filling but over-applies filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly solved training example 1 by properly identifying and filling enclosed non-7 components not touching top/bottom, preserving exposed ones.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated overfilled the grid, turning most middle and left-bottom areas to 7s (e.g., rows 1-10 mostly 7s except top-left 3s/5/6, and only a small bottom-right pocket with 0s/6/5/1/9 preserved), while expected preserves two separate structures—a middle-right pocket (rows 1-7, cols 6-15 with 0s/1/0/5/2/6/8/9) and a bottom-left pocket (rows 9-14, cols 1-8 with 0s/1/5/9/8/2/4)—likely because they touch bottom/sides but were incorrectly merged or deemed non-touching top/bottom.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated overfilled similarly, preserving only top-left (3s/6/8) and a tiny bottom-right strip (0s in col 14-15, rows 12-15), while expected preserves top-left plus a large middle-left structure (rows 5-14, cols 1-9 with 0s/5/2/1/9/6/8) and bottom-right 0s; difference is unknown but likely due to incorrect connectivity through numbers, filling bottom-touching components that should stay (e.g., expected keeps row 5-9 left with 0s/5/2/1).
 * Core issue across failures: Treats all non-7 (including 1-9) as connectable air, leading to over-merging and over-filling of preserved structures; expected outputs keep embedded numbers and surrounding 0s in bottom-touching "objects" intact, suggesting numbers may act as barriers for air fill or define preservable blobs.
 * touches_top_or_bottom is helpful but insufficient alone—may need to check bottom-only touching for preservation, or flood from bottom border to mark reachable areas instead of component-based filling.
 * No unhelpful functions here; all provided (is_non_seven, flood_component, touches_top_or_bottom) are relevant and functional, though is_non_seven may need tweaking to exclude 1-9 if they are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially resembles the incorrect training 2/3 patterns: It preserves top-left structure (rows 0-4, cols 0-5 with 2/5/4/3s and some 0s/6/1) and a large bottom-right/middle area (rows 5-15, cols 6-15 with scattered 0s/8/5/2/4/1/9), but fills middle areas with 7s (e.g., row 5 cols 0-5 has 9/0 then 7s).
 * It does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfilling seen in failed trainings (e.g., likely merged or incorrectly filled bottom-left/middle components that should be preserved like in training 2/3 expecteds, where multiple bottom-touching pockets with 0s around numbers remain); for instance, the test has isolated 9/0/8 in row 6-7 left, but if similar to trainings, this might be an overfilled "object" that should connect to a larger preserved structure touching bottom—unknown exact reason, but the sparse preservation suggests same connectivity error, leaving too few complex pockets.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on consistent patterns across all three train input/output pairs, the following components and properties show clear, repeatable interactions or effects. Only elements with evidence of interaction (e.g., one affecting the state of another) in **every** example are included. Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., background purple/magenta field, which never changes or interacts) and inconsistent effects (e.g., hole count changes in large Dark Red, which decrease in some cases but not others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle logic or total solution is inferred or provided. Unknown aspects (e.g., precise positional thresholds for interaction) are noted as such.

#### Components Involved
- **Large Dark Red component**: A multi-pixel structure (bbox consistently [0,0,15,15], holes variable but often >0 in inputs, pixels 100+, dominant in all examples).
- **Small colored components**: Discrete clusters (mostly 1-2 pixels, various colors: Blue, Light Blue, Yellow, Pink, Orange, Red, Maroon; bbox varies but small [x,y,x,y] or slight spans; holes=0). These are not a single type but a group defined by their interaction behavior.
- **Fixed small Dark Red component**: A small block (bbox consistently [0,0,2,2], pixels=5-6, holes=0). Included only because it consistently coexists without interaction.
- **Fixed Green component**: A small block (bbox consistently [0,0,3,3], pixels=7, holes=0). Included only because it consistently coexists without interaction.

(Note: No other components, such as black voids, show interactions. In the test input, multiple Dark Red components appear, but trains show only one large + one small; interaction consistency is based on trains only.)

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These occur in every train pair: some small colored components disappear from the output list, while the large Dark Red's pixel count increases by an amount matching the total pixels of the disappeared components (e.g., +79 in train 1, +25 in train 2, +81 in train 3). Remaining small colored components are unchanged. No movement, color shifts, or new components appear.

1. **Small colored components (Blue/Light Blue/Yellow/Pink/Orange/Red/Maroon) ↔ Large Dark Red (absorption based on position)**:
   - **Effect on large Dark Red**: Pixel count increases by the exact sum of pixels from absorbed small colored components. (Consistent in all examples; no other properties of large Dark Red consistently change.)
   - **Effect on small colored components**: Absorbed ones (subset based on position) are fully removed (disappear from output list). Non-absorbed ones remain identical (same color, bbox, pixels, holes=0).
   - **Interconnected properties**: Position (bbox of small component relative to large Dark Red's bbox/shape) determines absorption (e.g., some positions lead to removal and pixel addition to large Dark Red; consistent positional dependency observed, as not all small components absorb equally in each example). Pixel count of small component directly adds to large Dark Red's pixel count upon absorption.
   - **Unknown**: Exact positional rule (e.g., adjacency, enclosure in holes, or distance threshold) for which small components absorb vs. remain; cannot be determined from data without forcing inconsistent explanations.

2. **Small colored components → No effect on fixed small Dark Red or Green**:
   - Fixed small Dark Red and Green components remain completely unchanged (same bbox, pixels, holes, color) in every output, regardless of small colored component positions or absorptions. No pixel transfer, removal, or positional interaction occurs.
   - **Interconnected properties**: None direct; their fixed presence contrasts with the absorption interaction above, implying no position/pixel/hole dependency on other components.

3. **Large Dark Red → No effect on fixed small Dark Red or Green**:
   - Growth (pixel increase) of large Dark Red does not affect the fixed small Dark Red or Green in any way (no overlap, absorption, or positional shift). They coexist separately in all outputs.
   - **Interconnected properties**: Position (fixed top-left overlap in bbox with large Dark Red, but no merging); their separation is consistent despite large Dark Red's expansion.

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color effects like Yellow → Blue, hole count → color, or multi-pixel small components behaving differently) are consistent across all examples. Some small components have >1 pixel (e.g., Red pixels=2), but they follow the same absorption rules as 1-pixel ones.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 04:14:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving an N x N grid (appears to be 16x16 based on outputs) of integers where 7s act as barriers or absorbing material, and non-7 cells (0-6, 8-9) form connected structures; the goal is to process the grid by identifying and "absorbing" (filling with 7s) certain internal non-7 components while preserving others based on connectivity to grid edges, likely simulating some physical or logical rule like gravity, flooding, or structural support.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed by non-7 cells using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), ignoring 7s as impassable barriers.
 * The core rule appears to involve preserving non-7 components that are "attached" or reachable from specific edges (top/bottom in the attempt), while absorbing (setting to 7) isolated internal ones; however, this rule fails for cases where internal components are preserved in expected outputs despite not touching those edges.
 * Subtlety: Numbers 1-9 and 0 are treated uniformly as non-7/connectable, but 0 might represent empty space or a special case (e.g., air or void) that affects absorption differently—though the attempt doesn't distinguish them.
 * Edge touching is checked per cell in a component (any cell in row 0 or row N-1), but this over-absorbs in some cases, suggesting the rule might instead be flood-fill reachability from edges (e.g., preserve anything reachable from top/bottom without crossing 7s) rather than whole-component touching, or perhaps touching left/right sides instead.
 * Components can be complex shapes spanning multiple areas; absorbing one part shouldn't affect connected parts, but the attempt correctly uses BFS to group them.
 * Grids have consistent structure: left-side vertical structures often touch top, bottom-right or scattered blobs touch bottom, and central blobs may or may not be absorbed based on unseen rules.
 * Potential miss: Absorption might only apply to fully enclosed "holes" or floating islands not connected to any edge, but expected outputs preserve some central blobs, implying a different criterion (e.g., size threshold, or absorption propagates only from certain directions like bottom-up).
 * No modification of 7s themselves; output only changes non-7 to 7 in specific cases.
 * All examples show left-column structures (e.g., 3s) preserved, suggesting they touch top; bottom blobs sometimes preserved if touching bottom row.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly handles training example 1 by preserving top-touching and bottom-touching components while absorbing internals, matching expected fully.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated output absorbs central components (e.g., rows 1-7, cols 6-9 with 0s,1s, etc., and scattered right-side like row2 col12-14:6,0,4) into 7s, and partially preserves bottom (rows 11-15, cols 11-15 with 0s,6,5,1,8,9 but flattens some); expected preserves a complex central hanging structure (rows 1-7, cols 6-9 and extensions like row2 col12-14, row4 col13-15:9,0, etc.) and left extensions (row2 col0=5), plus bottom-left (rows 9-14, cols 1-5 with 0s,1,5,9,8, etc.)—difference: over-absorption of central blob that doesn't touch top/bottom but is preserved in expected (reason unknown, possibly wrong edge rule or needs flood-fill from edges).
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated absorbs most internals (e.g., central rows 5-14 various 0s/numbers become 7s, preserves only left top-touching 3s/6/8 and tiny bottom-right 0s in rows 12-15 col14-15); expected preserves left top (adds row1 col0=1), plus large central-left (rows 5-11, cols 1-5 with 0s,5,2,1,5,9,6) and bottom scattered (rows 9-15, cols 9-15 with 0s,9,8,6,4,0s)—difference: absorbs preserved central components (e.g., row6 col1-5:0,0,0,0,0 and extensions) that don't touch top/bottom, plus misses adding/changing some cells like row1 col0 from 7 to 1 (unknown why); bottom 0s partially match but structure differs.
 * Overall: Component extraction via BFS is solid and essential for identifying blobs without overlap; touching check is simple but incorrect for non-top/bottom edges or reachability—leads to over-filling with 7s in internals. No unhelpful functions; all are relevant but need rule refinement (e.g., try left/right touching or multi-edge flood fill). Attempt shows partial grasp of connectivity but misses why some internals are preserved (e.g., perhaps only absorb if fully enclosed or size-based).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves left vertical structure (cols 0-3, rows 0-3: numbers like 2,5,4,3s touching top) and bottom scattered components (rows 6-15, various cols with 0s/numbers like row15 col1-15:0,0,7,0,2,7,... touching bottom), but absorbs central/mid-level blobs (e.g., rows 6-15 cols 6-9 with 0s,8,5,2,4,1,9 etc. mostly set to 7s, leaving fragments like row6 col0=9, row7 col1=8).
 * This does not look correct: Similar to train 2/3 failures, it over-absorbs internal/central structures (e.g., the dense 0s/numbers in rows 7-15 cols 6-9 and extensions like row10 col7=1, row11 col8=9) that might need preservation if the rule allows "supported" or edge-reachable internals (unknown exact reason, but pattern matches expected preservations in trains); left and bottom partial matches suggest edge-touching works, but central filling mismatches likely puzzle intent—test likely expects more preserved mid/bottom shapes like in train 2's central blob.

[2025-10-03 04:14:46] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **every** example. Only properties or components with evidence of interaction (e.g., one affecting the state of another, such as transformation, removal, or change in properties like pixel count or holes) are included. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., background color, which remains uniform and unchanged) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., hole changes in the large Dark Red, which decrease in some pairs but not others) are noted as unknown where applicable. No high-level puzzle solution or speculation beyond direct observations is provided. Positions are treated as properties (e.g., bbox coordinates) that may link to changes.

1. **Large Dark Red block (bbox=[0,0,15,15]) ↔ Scattered single-pixel colored clusters (e.g., Yellow, Blue, Light Blue, Pink, Orange, Red, Maroon)**:
   - Interaction: The pixel count of the large Dark Red consistently increases in every output compared to its input counterpart (e.g., +79 in train 1, +25 in train 2, +81 in train 3). Simultaneously, a subset of the single-pixel colored clusters (all with pixels=1, holes=0) is consistently removed (e.g., 20+ removed in train 1, 5 in train 2, 10+ in train 3), with no new clusters added. Persistent clusters remain at their exact input positions, colors, and properties.
   - Properties involved: Pixel count (increases for Dark Red), presence/absence (removal for some colored clusters), position (bbox of removed/persistent clusters within [0,0,15,15]; no movement observed).
   - Consistency: Occurs in every pair; removed clusters are always single-pixel and colored (non-Dark Red, non-Green). Exact mechanism (e.g., why the Dark Red pixel increase does not numerically match removed pixel totals in all cases, such as train 2's +25 vs. 5 removed) is unknown.

2. **Small Dark Red cluster (bbox=[0,0,2,2], pixels=5 or 6, holes=0) ↔ No other elements**:
   - Interaction: None observed; this cluster is consistently present in every input and output, with unchanged position, pixel count (within each pair: 6 in trains 1/2, 5 in train 3), holes, and bbox. It overlaps positionally with the Green cluster but shows no effect on or from it or any other element.
   - Properties involved: Position (fixed top-left), pixel count (fixed within pair).
   - Consistency: Unchanged across all pairs, indicating isolation from transformations affecting other components.

3. **Green cluster (bbox=[0,0,3,3], pixels=7, holes=0) ↔ No other elements**:
   - Interaction: None observed; this cluster is consistently present in every input and output, with unchanged position, pixel count, holes, and bbox. It overlaps positionally with the small Dark Red but shows no effect on or from it, the large Dark Red, or any colored clusters.
   - Properties involved: Position (fixed top-left), pixel count (fixed at 7), shape properties (bbox and holes fixed).
   - Consistency: Unchanged across all pairs, indicating isolation from transformations affecting other components.

4. **Holes in large Dark Red block (bbox=[0,0,15,15]) ↔ Scattered single-pixel colored clusters**:
   - Interaction: Potential positional influence, as hole count in the large Dark Red changes in some pairs alongside colored cluster removals (e.g., decreases from 2 to 0 in train 1, 3 to 2 in train 3), but remains the same (3 to 3) in train 2 despite removals. No direct causal link (e.g., specific positions or colors filling holes) is consistently observable across all.
   - Properties involved: Hole count (varies), position (bbox of colored clusters relative to large Dark Red).
   - Consistency: Changes co-occur with colored cluster removals in every pair, but the direction/magnitude is not consistent; mechanism unknown.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no color-to-color effects, no consistent position-to-transformation rules like adjacency causing removal, no shape properties like edges or silhouettes affecting changes across all examples, no multi-pixel non-Dark Red/Green clusters persisting or interacting consistently). Elements without any observed effect on others (e.g., isolated single pixels that always persist) are not listed as they lack interconnection.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 04:17:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle task where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects, blobs, or patterns) to produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The puzzle involves understanding and applying rules to extract, manipulate, or match elements in these grids, but the previous attempt failed at the fundamental level of code structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations (training and test) fail with an error, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Grids are represented as lists of lists of integers (e.g., List[List[int]]), likely encoding visual features like colors, shapes, holes, or boundaries that need to be parsed into higher-level puzzle elements.
 * Puzzle rules probably involve identifying and extracting "objects" or "blobs" (connected components), counting features like holes, and applying transformations or matches based on keys or patterns—subtleties include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or components that don't span the full grid.
 * Outputs must match expected results exactly for training examples (which are not shown here but implied to be specific grid manipulations) and the test input; mismatches could stem from incorrect object detection, omission of certain elements, or failure to account for connectivity rules (e.g., 4-connected vs. 8-connected pixels).
 * Consider iterative refinement: mentally simulate grid processing to verify logic, as errors in extraction can propagate to all outputs.
 * All attempts so far show no successful processing, so focus on basic code validity before puzzle-specific logic like hole counting or shape matching.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions, types, or tools were generated in the previous attempt, as the code failed to define the required 'program' function. Future attempts should start with a skeleton like:

```python
def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Placeholder: implement grid processing here
    return grid  # Or transformed output
```

Functions like object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for blobs or hole detection) would be essential but are absent; avoid assuming untested tools without validation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed with the same error: "Generated code does not contain 'program' function," indicating a complete structural failure rather than puzzle logic issues.
 * Nothing worked: no outputs were generated, so no partial credit for logic, extraction, or matching.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the code requirements, let alone the puzzle rules, as it didn't produce any valid program to evaluate.
 * No functions for extracting objects (e.g., identifying blobs, counting holes, or detecting dividers) were included, making the code irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * This is the only attempt referenced, but it highlights the need to prioritize code format over premature puzzle solving.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense as a valid result—it indicates the code couldn't even be executed, so no puzzle processing occurred.
 * Without a proper output, it's impossible to verify if it matches the expected test result (e.g., a transformed grid accounting for objects, holes, or patterns); this is fundamentally different from any expected valid output, which should be a processed grid.
 * The error suggests the test case (an unseen grid) wasn't handled at all, missing all puzzle elements like object extraction or rule application—future attempts must ensure the 'program' function exists to even attempt matching the test.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of Python code that defines a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The goal is to analyze grids, extract or manipulate elements according to puzzle rules, and output results that match expected patterns, but the previous attempt failed due to a fundamental structural issue in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must include a 'program' function as the entry point; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of logic.
 * Grids are represented as List[List[int]], where values likely encode visual features (e.g., 0 for empty, positive ints for object types, colors, or shapes).
 * Puzzle rules probably involve identifying and extracting "objects" (connected components or blobs) from the grid, counting features like holes or sizes, and applying transformations or matches to a "key" pattern.
 * Subtle elements: Handle edge cases like disconnected objects, irregular shapes, or grids where objects don't span the full width/height; ensure outputs preserve grid dimensions or format exactly (e.g., no extra spaces or modified boundaries).
 * Outputs should be grids or simplified representations that visually or structurally match expectations, potentially omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching a key criteria like hole count).
 * Consider rotational symmetry, mirroring, or adjacency rules for object validation, as visual puzzles often include these.
 * All training examples and test must pass independently; partial logic won't suffice if the function is missing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

class GridObject:
    def __init__(self, positions: List[tuple], hole_count: int = 0, size: int = 0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples for connected cells
        self.hole_count = hole_count
        self.size = size
```

```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[GridObject]:
    # Flood-fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (objects) in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming 0 is background
                component = dfs(grid, i, j, visited)  # Implement DFS to get positions, count holes
                hole_count = count_holes(component, grid)  # Custom function to detect enclosed zeros
                objects.append(GridObject(component, hole_count, len(component)))
    return objects
```

```python
def count_holes(component: List[tuple], grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Placeholder: Analyze bounding box of component for enclosed empty cells (0s)
    # This is subtle and easy to miss—holes are internal voids, not external spaces
    min_r, max_r = min(p[0] for p in component), max(p[0] for p in component)
    min_c, max_c = min(p[1] for p in component), max(p[1] for p in component)
    internal_zeros = 0
    for r in range(min_r + 1, max_r):  # Skip borders
        for c in range(min_c + 1, max_c):
            if grid[r][c] == 0 and is_enclosed((r, c), component):  # Check if surrounded
                internal_zeros += 1
    return internal_zeros // 4  # Approximate for 4-connected holes; refine based on puzzle
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated program lacked the required 'program' function entirely, causing immediate errors across all training examples and the test input.
 * No object extraction or grid processing logic was present, so nothing worked—complete structural failure.
 * No evidence of understanding grid representation or visual rules; code was invalid Python for the puzzle framework.
 * Function to extract objects wasn't attempted, which is essential for identifying blobs, holes, or matches in visual puzzles.
 * All attempts (only one shown) resulted in the same error, indicating no progress on core requirements.
 * The extract_objects function (not used) would be helpful, but without it, puzzles involving connected components can't be solved.
 * No unhelpful functions were generated, but future attempts should avoid incomplete code skeletons without the 'program' entry point.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not look correct because it indicates a total failure to produce valid, runnable code.
 * No actual output grid or processed result was generated, so it can't be compared to expected puzzle solution (e.g., a transformed grid matching visual rules).
 * This differs from expectations: The test input grid should yield a specific output (e.g., extracted objects or a modified grid omitting invalid elements), but instead, evaluation halted early—likely the expected output involves applying rules like hole counting or shape matching, which wasn't reached.
 * The error persists across all cases, confirming the code doesn't handle any input correctly, including the test's unique grid features (e.g., possibly irregular objects or a key pattern).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of a Python program with a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs, likely involving object extraction, pattern recognition, or manipulation for training examples and a test case. The goal is to produce correct outputs that match expected puzzle rules, but the previous attempt failed entirely due to structural issues in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a 'program' function, as this is the entry point expected by the evaluator; without it, all runs fail with errors.
 * Puzzle likely involves grids (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual elements like objects, blobs, holes, or dividers, requiring extraction and analysis to determine outputs like shapes, counts, or omissions.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases such as incomplete stretches across grids, mismatched shapes, or specific omission rules (e.g., ignoring objects not matching criteria like hole counts or keys).
 * Ensure outputs for training examples pass without errors before testing; failures indicate basic structural or rule misunderstandings.
 * Consider grid symmetries, blob connectivity, or key components that may not span the entire grid, which could lead to incorrect extractions.
 * All attempts must mentally simulate puzzle rules (e.g., object detection, counting features) on inputs to verify outputs, noting differences explicitly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions identified from previous attempts, as all code failed structurally.
# Potential future tool: A basic grid parser to avoid structural errors.
def parse_grid(input_str: str) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Placeholder: Convert string or raw input to grid format.
    lines = input_str.strip().split('\n')
    return [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines if line.strip()]
```

```python
# Essential: The required 'program' function skeleton to prevent errors.
def program(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    # Process grid here (e.g., extract objects, apply rules).
    # Return the puzzle output as a string.
    return "processed_output"
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating a complete structural failure in code generation.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated at all, so no partial matches, object extractions, or rule applications could be evaluated.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the code requirements, as even basic function definition was missing.
 * No helpful functions were produced; any attempted code (not shown) is irrelevant or broken due to lacking the core 'program' function.
 * Subtle issue: Without the 'program' function, no mental simulation or rule application could occur, blocking all progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates no processing happened at all.
 * Expected test output should be a valid puzzle result (e.g., a string describing extracted objects or a pattern match), but this error means the program couldn't run, missing all key elements like object detection or rule-based output.
 * This failure highlights the need to prioritize code structure; without it, test cases can't be handled, regardless of puzzle rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 16x16 grid containing 0s (empty/unfilled cells), 7s (background or wall cells), and numbers 1-9 (likely clues, objects, or barriers). The goal is to produce an output grid by filling certain 0s with 7s to distinguish exterior/unbounded regions from internal enclosed regions, while preserving numbers 1-9 and existing 7s unchanged; internal 0 regions that are fully enclosed (not connected to the border) should remain 0, forming shapes or "rooms" around or between numbered clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s represent traversable empty space for flooding/propagation, but only those connected to the grid border should be filled with 7 (exterior region); disconnected internal 0 clusters must remain 0 to match enclosed areas in expected outputs.
 * Numbers 1-9 act as barriers: the flood cannot pass through or over them (they block adjacency for 0-paths), and they remain unchanged in the output.
 * 7s are pre-filled background/walls: they block flooding (cannot traverse them) but may influence starting points for the fill.
 * Subtlety: Defining "connected to border" is critical and tricky—simple adjacency via 0-paths to border 0s may miss regions adjacent only to border 7s or border numbers; conversely, over-seeding from border 7s can incorrectly fill internal regions by treating border-adjacent 0s as exterior even if isolated internally.
 * The grid borders themselves may contain 0s, 7s, or numbers, complicating seeding: if a border cell is a number, adjacent internal 0s might need filling if considered exterior, but this risks over-filling.
 * No diagonal movement: flooding uses 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).
 * Multiple disconnected 0 regions exist; only the one touching the border gets filled—internal ones stay 0, often forming blob-like shapes in expected outputs (e.g., surrounding numbers without touching borders).
 * Potential for 2x2 or larger empty internal areas that must remain 0; over-filling these violates the enclosure rule.
 * The puzzle may involve implicit rules like no touching islands or connected sea, but based on outputs, the core is exterior vs. interior 0 regions.
 * Visually, expected outputs show 0s clustering into enclosed "pockets" (e.g., around numbers in ex2 upper grid, or linear paths in ex1 lower grid), suggesting the fill must precisely avoid crossing number barriers.
 * Copying the grid is essential to avoid mutating the input.
 * Visited tracking prevents revisiting and ensures efficient BFS/DFS flooding.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for safe grid duplication before modification.)

```python
def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # (Current seeding logic, but flawed: starts from border 0 or 7)
    # ... (rest of BFS as in attempt)
    return h
```
(This BFS flood-fill structure is helpful and core to the problem, as it correctly handles 4-dir propagation through 0s and visited tracking; it just needs seeding and enqueue conditions fixed to properly distinguish exterior from interior. Use DFS as alternative if needed for recursion.)

(No other functions like object extraction are present or needed; the problem doesn't require identifying or counting objects around numbers—it's purely about regional filling of 0s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses a BFS flood-fill starting from all border cells that are 0 or 7, propagating only through unvisited 0s and setting them to 7; this partially understands the exterior-filling concept but fails consistently due to incorrect seeding, leading to under-filling in some cases and over-filling in others.
 * In training example 1: Generated under-filled (left 0s remaining) in row 6 (cols 3-6 and 9-10 as 0,0,0,0 and 0,0) and mismatched lower regions (e.g., row 7 has 0s at cols 3-6,9-10,13 but expected has all 7s in row 6 and specific 0s only in lower rows like row 7 cols 14-15, row 9 cols 14-15, row 10 col 15, row 11 cols 8-11,13-15, etc.); upper rows 0-5 mostly match, but the fill didn't reach some exterior 0s (possibly due to number barriers or seeding missing border numbers), while incorrectly leaving internal-adjacent 0s unfilled when expected treats them as exterior.
 * In training example 2: Generated over-filled massively (e.g., row 1 all 7s except numbers, but expected has 0s at cols 6-8 and 12-14; row 2 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols 7-8,13,15? Wait, col15 is 4 in expected? Actually cols 7-8=0,0 and col13=0? No, expected row2: 0s at 6? Wait, [5,7,6,3,7,7,1,0,0,7,7,7,6,0,4,7] so 0s at cols7-8,13; generated has all 7s there), turning most internal 0 clusters to 7 when expected preserves them as enclosed regions (e.g., 0s forming shapes around numbers in rows 1-7 and separate pockets in rows 9-14); this suggests seeding from border 7s incorrectly treated internal components adjacent to background as exterior.
 * In training example 3: Generated over-filled internal areas (e.g., row 5 all 7s except some numbers like 5,9,5 but expected has 0s at cols1-5; row 7 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols1-2? Wait, expected row6: [7,0,0,0,0,0,7,...] so 0s cols1-5, but generated row6? Wait, rows are 0-indexed, generated row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,9,7,5,7] filled to 7s where expected has 0s; lower rows like 9-15 have some 0s filled differently, e.g., row9 generated has 0s at cols9-12 but expected has more structured 0s in cols1-3,4-5?); upper rows 0-3 mostly match, but fill invaded enclosed 0 pockets (e.g., row6-9 expected 0 clusters around numbers, but generated filled them).
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates understanding of BFS for regional filling and barrier handling (numbers/7s not traversed), but misses subtle seeding: including border 7s causes over-filling of near-border internals in ex2/ex3, while failing to fill some exterior 0s in ex1 (possibly because those 0s are only adjacent to border numbers, not enqueued); no object extraction needed, as numbers stay fixed—no counting holes or blobs required.
 * The copy_grid function works correctly and should be retained; fill_exterior_0s is mostly helpful but broken in seeding/enqueue logic (don't use as-is; modify to experiment with seeding only border 0s or all border cells).
 * No unhelpful functions present, but the current enqueue condition (only if h[nr][nc] == 0) is correct—don't change that; the issue is solely in initial queue population.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples; it over-fills some internal 0s (e.g., row 5 has isolated 0 at col1? Wait, row5: [9,0,7,7,...] leaves one 0 but fills around it, while expected likely wants enclosed clusters like in ex3 row5; row6: [7,8,7,0,0,7,...] leaves 0s at cols3-4 but fills others, potentially invading what should be internal pockets similar to ex2's preserved 0 shapes).
 * It under-fills or mismatches in lower rows (e.g., row12: [5,7,7,5,0,7,...] leaves scattered 0s, but training patterns suggest more structured enclosed 0s or full filling of exterior chains); overall, it resembles the over-filling in ex2/ex3 (many 7s with sparse 0s) rather than balanced exterior-only fill, so it likely incorrectly treats some internal regions as exterior due to seeding flaws—e.g., 0s in rows 6-9 cols3-4 seem like a small pocket that might should remain if enclosed, but without exact expected, it doesn't match the "enclosed blobs" subtlety seen in training.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 16x16 grid where numbers 0-9 represent colored pixels (likely with 7 as a background or "dark red" color), and the goal is to process the grid by selectively filling certain small, isolated connected components of non-7 pixels with 7 to remove noise or "absorbed blobs," while preserving larger structures, fixed elements (e.g., green components or specific shapes), and avoiding over-filling that alters intended features.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 4-connectivity for connected components of non-7 cells to identify blobs or objects.
 * Small components (e.g., noise or artifacts) should be absorbed into 7, but the size threshold (e.g., <=2 pixels) may be incorrect or context-dependent; some small blobs are filled in expected outputs, while others (possibly touching borders or specific colors) are preserved.
 * Preserve larger components (e.g., green areas, which are not small) and fixed elements like structural bars or shapes; do not absorb everything non-7.
 * Subtle changes occur beyond simple absorption: in some cases, positions that were 7 in input become non-7 in expected (e.g., revealing or adjusting pixels), or specific small blobs are not filled if they form part of a larger pattern/key.
 * Bbox checks (e.g., inside 0-15) are always true on a 16x16 grid and unhelpful; focus on component size, isolation, and possibly color (numbers) uniformity.
 * Grids have vertical/horizontal structures (e.g., left columns with 3s or 7s), and absorption seems targeted at "floating" small blobs not connected to main objects.
 * Expected outputs often expand 7 areas in lower/mid sections but retain or adjust upper blobs; over-absorption can change intended pixels (e.g., turning a key pixel to 7 when it should stay).
 * Consider color-specific rules: numbers like 0 might be neutral/background variants, while others (1-6,8,9) are distinct objects; 7 is dominant background.
 * Border-touching components might be preserved differently; some small components in expected are filled only if fully enclosed.
 * No rotation, shifting, or complex math observed—just selective filling and possible minor adjustments for puzzle "cleaning."

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt focused on absorbing small (<=2 pixel) non-7 components into 7 using 4-connectivity, with preservation of larger elements; get_non_seven_components is helpful for blob extraction but overall logic failed all training examples.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and processes some small isolated blobs (e.g., partial filling in mid-sections of train1 and train2), and preserves large components like potential green areas.
 * What didn't work: Over-absorbs or under-absorbs—e.g., in train1, generated sets position (0,0) to 7 (should be 4), fails to fill lower blobs like row7 col14-15 (0,0 should be 7s but generated keeps them), and leaves row2 col13-15 as 0,4,0 (should be 7s); mismatches in rows 6-16 where expected has more uniform 7s in mid-right but generated retains scattered non-7s.
 * In train2, generated sets row0 col1 to 7 (should be 9), fails to fill small blobs in rows 12-15 (e.g., row12 col15=0 should be 7, but generated keeps it), and incorrectly fills row15 entirely to 7s (expected keeps some 0s in col11-15); under-fills upper left blobs.
 * In train3, generated keeps too many small blobs (e.g., row1 col9-15 as 0,8,0,... should be mostly 7s), sets row0 col1 to 7 (should be 6), and fails to fill mid components like row5 col1-5 (0s should be 7s); over-preserves scattered 0s in lower rows.
 * component_bbox_inside_large is unhelpful/broken (always true, adds no value—avoid in future).
 * is_small_component threshold too strict; misses that some "small" components in expected are filled differently based on enclosure or color.
 * preserve_fixed_elements does nothing useful (just returns input—redundant).
 * absorb_small_components core idea is partially right (noise removal) but lacks subtlety like color checks or border rules; leads to mismatches in all cases.
 * No extraction of specific objects (e.g., by color) attempted, which may be needed for distinguishing absorbable vs. preserved blobs.
 * Train1: Generated has extra non-7s in lower half (e.g., row11 col0-15 scattered 0s/1s kept, should be more 7s) and wrong top-left adjustment.
 * Train2: Mismatches top row (7 vs. 9 at (0,1)) and bottom rows (over-fills row15 to all 7s, expected retains 8,0,0,0,0).
 * Train3: Keeps too many upper/mid small components (e.g., row1 col7-15 non-7s vs. expected 7s), unknown reason for partial fills.
 * Overall, attempt shows basic understanding of components but poor matching; differences are specific pixel changes (e.g., 7->non-7 or vice versa) without clear pattern.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains many scattered small non-7 components (e.g., row1 col6-15: 0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,7 should likely be more 7s based on training patterns of filling isolated blobs), over-preserves upper left (e.g., row1 col2=5, row2 col1=4 kept, but expected likely fills to 7 like train3 upper), and leaves lower right noisy (e.g., row12 col13=9, row13 col9=8 kept as small blobs, probably should absorb to 7). 
 * It fails to uniform-ize mid sections (e.g., row6-10 col6-9 have mixed 0s/non-7s, expected would fill small ones per training). 
 * Looks like partial absorption happened (e.g., some 7 expansions in row4-5), but inconsistencies (e.g., row7 col1=8 kept) suggest wrong threshold or no color/object distinction; does not make sense as a "cleaned" puzzle grid compared to expected training patterns of broader 7 fills in enclosed areas.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 16x16 grid of integer values representing colored pixels, where the goal is to process the grid by absorbing certain connected components of non-7 pixels (likely non-dark-red elements) into 7, while preserving specific components that touch borders, are single pixels on edges, or are in special regions like the top-left, based on rules inferred from training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule 1: Absorb internal (non-border-touching) connected components of non-7 pixels into 7; components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right), and only non-7 pixels are considered part of a component—7 acts as a barrier.
 * Core rule 2: Preserve small components in the top-left area (e.g., 4x4 region) even if internal, possibly due to overlapping bounding boxes of dark red (7) and green (or other colors) elements; this prevents over-absorption in that zone.
 * Core rule 3: Preserve single-pixel non-7 components on the canvas borders (rows 0/15 or columns 0/15), but absorb internal single pixels; also, preserve larger border-touching components entirely.
 * Subtlety: Components touching any border pixel must be fully preserved (not absorbed), even if mostly internal; the find_component function correctly tracks this via touches_border flag.
 * Subtlety: The absorption happens only for components where all pixels are non-7 and the entire component doesn't touch the border; 7 pixels are not part of any component and block connectivity.
 * Easy to miss: Edge singles are checked after absorption, but the code's preserve_edge_singles also absorbs internal singles redundantly—order matters, as absorption should precede edge preservation.
 * Easy to miss: Top-left preservation is a no-op in the code (just a pass), but examples show top-left patterns remain unchanged, suggesting the absorption rule alone might handle it if components there touch implicit borders or are special.
 * Consideration: Grids have scattered non-7 pixels forming "objects" or clusters; expected outputs show some internal clusters absorbed (turned to 7) while border-connected or special ones stay.
 * Consideration: No diagonal connectivity—only orthogonal neighbors.
 * Potential issue: The code runs absorption first, then top-left (no-op), then edge singles, but examples suggest more nuanced preservation, like not absorbing certain multi-pixel internal groups if they are "small" or in specific positions.
 * From examples: In training 1, bottom rows have preserved patterns (e.g., row 11 has 0s preserved differently); in training 2, a large central structure is partially preserved with specific colors; in training 3, upper components are absorbed more aggressively in generated vs. expected.

    return component, touches_border
```
These functions are helpful for identifying connected components and checking border touches using BFS; they correctly model 4-connectivity and ignore 7s.

```python
def absorb_internal_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Handles rule 1: Absorb internal small colored pixel clusters into large dark red by setting non-border-touching non-7 components to 7."""
    n = len(grid)
    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if result[i][j] != 7 and not visited[i][j]:
                component, touches_border = find_component(result, i, j, visited, n)
                if not touches_border:
                    for x, y in component:
                        result[x][y] = 7
    return result
```
This is helpful for the core absorption logic but may over-absorb if not combined with other rules.

The preserve_top_left_overlap and preserve_edge_singles functions are partially helpful but flawed: top-left is a no-op (unhelpful as-is), and edge singles redundantly absorbs internals without fully preserving multi-pixel border components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt models connected components and border touches correctly but fails all training examples due to over-absorption of certain internal or semi-internal clusters.
 * Train 1: Generated absorbs too much in bottom rows (e.g., row 11 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0]—extra 0s and 1 preserved incorrectly; row 12 has [9,5,0,9,0,0,8,6,7,9,0,0,8,7,6,0] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,0,0,8,7,6,0]—extra non-7s like 9,5,0 absorbed incorrectly into 7s).
 * Train 2: Generated absorbs almost everything except top-left and some bottom (e.g., rows 1-4 partially correct but row 1 has no [0,0,0,7] pattern; entire central structure in expected rows 1-7 is missing, replaced by 7s—fails to preserve a large border-touching? component).
 * Train 3: Generated preserves too many scattered pixels in upper/mid grid (e.g., row 1 has [1,7,7,3,...0,0,0,5,0,0,0] vs. expected all 7s after top-left; row 5 has [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,5,0] vs. expected mostly 7s with a separate structure starting row 6—over-preserves small internal clusters).
 * Missed full preservation of multi-pixel components that touch borders indirectly or via chains.
 * preserve_top_left_overlap is unhelpful (no-op, doesn't enforce anything).
 * preserve_edge_singles is partially helpful but broken: it checks singles post-absorption but doesn't prevent absorption of border-touching multi-pixel groups earlier; also absorbs internal singles redundantly.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond components, but find_component could be extended to list all components for debugging.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of absorption but misses nuances like preserving non-single border components and specific patterns in examples (e.g., unknown reason for row 11 differences in train 1—possibly special rule for bottom-edge clusters).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it preserves too many internal non-7 pixels (e.g., scattered 0s,1s, etc. in columns 6-9 and rows 6-15 remain as a loose structure, but expected likely absorbs most internals while keeping top-left [7,2,7,3...], the 3-square in row 3, and border touches like row 5 col 0=9).
 * It fails to absorb central/internal clusters (e.g., the vertical line of 0s in col 6 rows 0-5 should likely be absorbed if not border-touching, but stays; bottom rows have preserved 0s/1s/5s that may need absorption if internal).
 * Compared to training patterns, it over-preserves like in train 3 (scattered pixels stay), suggesting the program doesn't fully implement border-only preservation.
 * To handle test, need to ensure only border-touching components (including multi-pixel) stay, absorb all else, and check for top-left/edge specials—current output has too many non-7s in mid-grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving an N x N grid (appears to be 16x16 based on outputs) of integers where 7s act as barriers or absorbing material, and non-7 cells (0-6, 8-9) form connected structures; the goal is to process the grid by identifying and "absorbing" (filling with 7s) certain internal non-7 components while preserving others based on connectivity to grid edges, likely simulating some physical or logical rule like gravity, flooding, or structural support.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed by non-7 cells using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), ignoring 7s as impassable barriers.
 * The core rule appears to involve preserving non-7 components that are "attached" or reachable from specific edges (top/bottom in the attempt), while absorbing (setting to 7) isolated internal ones; however, this rule fails for cases where internal components are preserved in expected outputs despite not touching those edges.
 * Subtlety: Numbers 1-9 and 0 are treated uniformly as non-7/connectable, but 0 might represent empty space or a special case (e.g., air or void) that affects absorption differently—though the attempt doesn't distinguish them.
 * Edge touching is checked per cell in a component (any cell in row 0 or row N-1), but this over-absorbs in some cases, suggesting the rule might instead be flood-fill reachability from edges (e.g., preserve anything reachable from top/bottom without crossing 7s) rather than whole-component touching, or perhaps touching left/right sides instead.
 * Components can be complex shapes spanning multiple areas; absorbing one part shouldn't affect connected parts, but the attempt correctly uses BFS to group them.
 * Grids have consistent structure: left-side vertical structures often touch top, bottom-right or scattered blobs touch bottom, and central blobs may or may not be absorbed based on unseen rules.
 * Potential miss: Absorption might only apply to fully enclosed "holes" or floating islands not connected to any edge, but expected outputs preserve some central blobs, implying a different criterion (e.g., size threshold, or absorption propagates only from certain directions like bottom-up).
 * No modification of 7s themselves; output only changes non-7 to 7 in specific cases.
 * All examples show left-column structures (e.g., 3s) preserved, suggesting they touch top; bottom blobs sometimes preserved if touching bottom row.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly handles training example 1 by preserving top-touching and bottom-touching components while absorbing internals, matching expected fully.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated output absorbs central components (e.g., rows 1-7, cols 6-9 with 0s,1s, etc., and scattered right-side like row2 col12-14:6,0,4) into 7s, and partially preserves bottom (rows 11-15, cols 11-15 with 0s,6,5,1,8,9 but flattens some); expected preserves a complex central hanging structure (rows 1-7, cols 6-9 and extensions like row2 col12-14, row4 col13-15:9,0, etc.) and left extensions (row2 col0=5), plus bottom-left (rows 9-14, cols 1-5 with 0s,1,5,9,8, etc.)—difference: over-absorption of central blob that doesn't touch top/bottom but is preserved in expected (reason unknown, possibly wrong edge rule or needs flood-fill from edges).
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated absorbs most internals (e.g., central rows 5-14 various 0s/numbers become 7s, preserves only left top-touching 3s/6/8 and tiny bottom-right 0s in rows 12-15 col14-15); expected preserves left top (adds row1 col0=1), plus large central-left (rows 5-11, cols 1-5 with 0s,5,2,1,5,9,6) and bottom scattered (rows 9-15, cols 9-15 with 0s,9,8,6,4,0s)—difference: absorbs preserved central components (e.g., row6 col1-5:0,0,0,0,0 and extensions) that don't touch top/bottom, plus misses adding/changing some cells like row1 col0 from 7 to 1 (unknown why); bottom 0s partially match but structure differs.
 * Overall: Component extraction via BFS is solid and essential for identifying blobs without overlap; touching check is simple but incorrect for non-top/bottom edges or reachability—leads to over-filling with 7s in internals. No unhelpful functions; all are relevant but need rule refinement (e.g., try left/right touching or multi-edge flood fill). Attempt shows partial grasp of connectivity but misses why some internals are preserved (e.g., perhaps only absorb if fully enclosed or size-based).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves left vertical structure (cols 0-3, rows 0-3: numbers like 2,5,4,3s touching top) and bottom scattered components (rows 6-15, various cols with 0s/numbers like row15 col1-15:0,0,7,0,2,7,... touching bottom), but absorbs central/mid-level blobs (e.g., rows 6-15 cols 6-9 with 0s,8,5,2,4,1,9 etc. mostly set to 7s, leaving fragments like row6 col0=9, row7 col1=8).
 * This does not look correct: Similar to train 2/3 failures, it over-absorbs internal/central structures (e.g., the dense 0s/numbers in rows 7-15 cols 6-9 and extensions like row10 col7=1, row11 col8=9) that might need preservation if the rule allows "supported" or edge-reachable internals (unknown exact reason, but pattern matches expected preservations in trains); left and bottom partial matches suggest edge-touching works, but central filling mismatches likely puzzle intent—test likely expects more preserved mid/bottom shapes like in train 2's central blob.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a 16x16 grid-based logic puzzle where input grids contain 0s (empty cells), 7s (pre-filled cells, likely representing "sea" or "exterior" filler), and scattered numbers (1-6, 8, 9 as fixed clues). The goal is to fill certain 0s with 7s based on connectivity rules to determine "exterior" or fillable regions, while leaving other 0s unfilled (likely interior or clue-related regions) and preserving all clue numbers unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s connected via other 0s to any border (top, bottom, left, right) should generally be filled with 7s, treating border 7s as starting points for propagation, but not all border-adjacent 0s are filled (e.g., some interior-touching border 0s remain 0 in expected outputs, suggesting over-simple flood fill overfills).
 * Propagation only through 0s (not through numbers or existing 7s beyond seeding), but seeding must include all four borders; missing bottom/right seeding leads to underfilling in enclosed-but-exterior-connected areas.
 * Clue numbers (1-6, 8, 9) must never be changed to 7; they remain fixed regardless of adjacency to 7s, indicating they define or protect interior regions (e.g., possible island clues in a Nurikabe-like puzzle where 7 is sea and 0s are island spaces).
 * Some interior regions of 0s and numbers are completely filled to 7s in expected outputs (e.g., no remaining 0s or numbers in certain blocks), suggesting rules for identifying "degenerate" or non-protected regions that get fully filled, possibly if they violate enclosure or size rules.
 * Remaining 0s form connected clusters often adjacent to or containing clue numbers, implying 0s in "protected" interior regions (enclosed by 7s) stay unfilled, potentially with subtle rules like no 2x2 0-blocks or region sizes matching clues (e.g., a "1" clue might protect a single adjacent 0 or itself).
 * Existing 7s act as barriers but also as seeds for filling adjacent 0s; interior 7s do not propagate filling unless connected via the flood (but current code doesn't seed interior 7s).
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s aren't always filled (e.g., train2 row1 0s remain 0 despite top-border proximity), so connectivity must consider enclosures created by numbers/7s; overflooding happens if ignoring that some 0s are "internal" even near borders.
 * No diagonal connectivity (only orthogonal, as in code's dirs); all changes are iterative but single-pass flood suffices if seeded correctly.
 * Across attempts, no handling for clue-based filling (e.g., expanding regions from numbers) or validation rules (e.g., ensuring no touching interiors), leading to mismatches in both over- and under-filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `fill_exterior_0s` function is partially helpful as a flood-fill base for exterior 0s but broken (incomplete border seeding leads to underfilling; fix by adding bottom/right border seeding loops similar to top/left). It correctly propagates only through 0s and preserves non-0s.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = 16
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # Start from all four borders: cells that are 0 or 7
    # Top
    for c in range(n):
        if h[0][c] == 0 or h[0][c] == 7:
            q.append((0, c))
            visited[0][c] = True
    # Bottom
    for c in range(n):
        if h[n-1][c] == 0 or h[n-1][c] == 7:
            if not visited[n-1][c]:
                q.append((n-1, c))
                visited[n-1][c] = True
    # Left (skip corners if already visited)
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][0] == 0 or h[r][0] == 7:
            if not visited[r][0]:
                q.append((r, 0))
                visited[r][0] = True
    # Right
    for r in range(n):
        if h[r][n-1] == 0 or h[r][n-1] == 7:
            if not visited[r][n-1]:
                q.append((r, n-1))
                visited[r][n-1] = True
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while q:
        r, c = q.popleft()
        if h[r][c] == 0:
            h[r][c] = 7
        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and h[nr][nc] == 0:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                q.append((nr, nc))
    return h
```

No other helpful functions from the attempt; no types or object-extraction tools were used or needed yet (e.g., no need for extracting regions around clues).

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
The `fill_isolated_non7` function is broken and irrelevant: it incorrectly changes fixed clue numbers (non-0 non-7) to 7 based on >=3 adjacent 7s, but expected outputs preserve all clues unchanged. It also doesn't affect 0s and runs in a loop that may over-apply, leading to invalid changes (e.g., in train1 row12, it left some clues but expected filled areas to 7 without changing clues elsewhere). Do not use in future attempts.

```python
def fill_isolated_non7(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:  # Broken: changes clues, ignores 0s, not puzzle-relevant
    # ... (code as provided, but discard)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incomplete flood fill (only top/left borders seeded, causing underfilling of 0s connected via bottom/right, e.g., train1 row6 left as [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,5,7,...] vs. expected all 7s; train3 row12-15 similar underfill of 0s).
 * Overfilling in non-enclosed areas: e.g., train2 row1 0s filled to 7s ([7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,...] generated vs. expected [7,7,7,3,7,7,0,0,0,7,...] with 0s preserved), suggesting border 0s aren't always exterior if part of interior structures.
 * Clue preservation failed indirectly: `fill_isolated_non7` didn't change most clues but was applied after flood, leaving mismatches where entire regions should be 7-filled without altering clues (e.g., train1 row7 generated [7,7,7,0,0,9,0,2,9,0,0,7,...] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,...], where 0s/clues stayed but should have been filled around/nearby).
 * Train1: Underfilled interior 0s (row6, row7 partial, row12 start [9,5,...] vs. expected 7s); overfilled nothing obvious but last two 0s correctly preserved in row7/8.
 * Train2: Severe overfilling of upper 0s (rows1-6 all mostly 7s generated vs. expected with 0-clusters and embedded clues like 1,5,2,6,9,8); lower 0s underfilled due to no right-border seed (row11-13 0s at end left vs. expected preserved as interior).
 * Train3: Underfilled lower 0s (rows12-15 [...,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] patterns vs. expected with some 7-fills but preserved 0-clusters around clues like 9,8,6,1,2); top overfilled slightly (row2 [7,7,8,3,...] but expected [7,7,8,3,...] similar, minor diff in row0 [7,7,7,3,...] vs. [7,6,7,3,...] unknown why 5->7? Wait, likely input diff but code filled adjacent 0s wrong).
 * No extraction of objects/regions (e.g., no function to identify clue-connected 0-clusters), missing for handling interior protections.
 * `fill_isolated_non7` caused no visible changes in most cases (clues had <3 adj 7s post-flood) but is conceptually wrong; remove it.
 * Overall, no handling for why some 0-clusters remain (e.g., enclosure by 7s/numbers) or clue implications (e.g., numbers protecting adjacent 0s from filling).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills some border-adjacent 0s (e.g., row5 [9,0,7,...] likely filled 0 to 7 incorrectly if that 0 is interior-protected like train2) and underfills lower/middle 0-clusters (e.g., rows7-15 have many unfilled 0s around clues like 2,4,1,9,5,6,8, but expected likely preserves some as interior while filling others to 7 based on connectivity/enclosure).
 * Specifically, row6 generated all 7s except scattered, but test input has 0s in row5 col10-15 [9,0,0,0,0,0], likely underfilled due to missing right-border seed (should connect via right if exterior).
 * Middle areas (rows7-9 cols3-15) have 0s preserved around clues (e.g., 2,4,0s), but if connected to bottom/right, they should be 7s per partial rules, yet code leaves them 0—mismatch similar to train1 underfill.
 * Lower rows (12-15) have 0s at ends (e.g., row12 col15=0, row13 col9=1 but adjacent 0s), looking like unfilled interiors, but without full borders seeded, it ignores potential exterior paths; also no clue changes, which is good, but overall too many 0s remain compared to expected patterns in training (e.g., train2 preserves 0-clusters but fills disconnected ones).
 * Does not account for protected 0s near borders (like train2 row1), leading to potential overfill in test's upper 0s (row5-6); unknown if test has enclosed regions with multiple clues (like train2 lower left), but code would fill them wrong without region extraction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where 7 represents barriers or walls, non-7 cells (0-6,8,9) represent open spaces, air, or labeled objects, and the task is to identify connected components of these non-7 cells using 4-way adjacency, then fill (set to 7) only those components that are fully enclosed—specifically, those not touching the top row (row 0) or bottom row (row n-1)—effectively removing "trapped" or floating regions while preserving components connected to the top or bottom (possibly simulating exposure to air or ground).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connectivity is strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only through non-7 cells; diagonal does not count.
 * Components are groups of adjacent non-7 cells; all non-7 values (including numbers 1-9 and 0s) are treated as connectable in the current approach, but this may be a subtlety—numbers 1-9 might represent solid "objects" that should block connectivity for air (0s only) or require special handling to preserve their positions and surrounding 0s if the object touches the bottom.
 * Filling only occurs for components not touching top or bottom rows; components touching either are preserved entirely (including their internal structure of 0s and numbers), which suggests a "grounded" or "exposed" rule where bottom-touching structures (e.g., cave formations or lakes) stay intact.
 * Subtle element: The puzzle likely preserves complex structures (e.g., "islands" or "pockets" with embedded numbers surrounded by 0s) if they touch the bottom, but the current flood fill merges separate structures incorrectly if they are connected through non-7 paths that shouldn't be (e.g., treating numbers as passable air).
 * Easy to miss: Not all enclosed areas are filled—only truly trapped ones; side-touching but bottom-touching components must be preserved, and the program may overfill by not distinguishing between air (0s) and objects (1-9). In expected outputs, preserved areas often have intricate patterns of 0s around numbers, suggesting objects define boundaries rather than being filled themselves.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, reflection, or value modification beyond filling to 7; grid size n=16 in examples; 7s are immutable barriers that block all connectivity and filling.
 * Potential misinterpretation: This isn't simple border flooding (e.g., from all sides); the top/bottom check implies vertical exposure (e.g., air from top, ground from bottom), not full perimeter. Numbers 1-9 are preserved in place in expected outputs, so filling shouldn't overwrite them unless the entire component is trapped.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program includes useful building blocks for component detection and filling, which align with core flood-fill logic.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def is_non_seven(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] != 7
```
(This bounds-checks and identifies traversable non-7 cells; helpful for any connectivity-based approach.)

```python
def touches_top_or_bottom(component: List[tuple], n: int) -> bool:
    for x, y in component:
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
            return True
    return False
```
(This correctly identifies exposure to top/bottom; essential for the enclosure rule, though may need extension to preserve side/bottom structures.)

```python
def flood_component(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[tuple]:
    component = []
    q = deque([(x, y)])
    visited[x][y] = True
    while q:
        cx, cy = q.popleft()
        component.append((cx, cy))
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_non_seven(nx, ny, g, n) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return component
```
(This performs accurate 4-way BFS flood fill to extract components; very helpful and not broken—reuse it, but consider modifying is_non_seven to only traverse 0s if numbers are solid.)

The main program function integrates these well for iteration and filling but over-applies filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly solved training example 1 by properly identifying and filling enclosed non-7 components not touching top/bottom, preserving exposed ones.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated overfilled the grid, turning most middle and left-bottom areas to 7s (e.g., rows 1-10 mostly 7s except top-left 3s/5/6, and only a small bottom-right pocket with 0s/6/5/1/9 preserved), while expected preserves two separate structures—a middle-right pocket (rows 1-7, cols 6-15 with 0s/1/0/5/2/6/8/9) and a bottom-left pocket (rows 9-14, cols 1-8 with 0s/1/5/9/8/2/4)—likely because they touch bottom/sides but were incorrectly merged or deemed non-touching top/bottom.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated overfilled similarly, preserving only top-left (3s/6/8) and a tiny bottom-right strip (0s in col 14-15, rows 12-15), while expected preserves top-left plus a large middle-left structure (rows 5-14, cols 1-9 with 0s/5/2/1/9/6/8) and bottom-right 0s; difference is unknown but likely due to incorrect connectivity through numbers, filling bottom-touching components that should stay (e.g., expected keeps row 5-9 left with 0s/5/2/1).
 * Core issue across failures: Treats all non-7 (including 1-9) as connectable air, leading to over-merging and over-filling of preserved structures; expected outputs keep embedded numbers and surrounding 0s in bottom-touching "objects" intact, suggesting numbers may act as barriers for air fill or define preservable blobs.
 * touches_top_or_bottom is helpful but insufficient alone—may need to check bottom-only touching for preservation, or flood from bottom border to mark reachable areas instead of component-based filling.
 * No unhelpful functions here; all provided (is_non_seven, flood_component, touches_top_or_bottom) are relevant and functional, though is_non_seven may need tweaking to exclude 1-9 if they are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially resembles the incorrect training 2/3 patterns: It preserves top-left structure (rows 0-4, cols 0-5 with 2/5/4/3s and some 0s/6/1) and a large bottom-right/middle area (rows 5-15, cols 6-15 with scattered 0s/8/5/2/4/1/9), but fills middle areas with 7s (e.g., row 5 cols 0-5 has 9/0 then 7s).
 * It does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfilling seen in failed trainings (e.g., likely merged or incorrectly filled bottom-left/middle components that should be preserved like in training 2/3 expecteds, where multiple bottom-touching pockets with 0s around numbers remain); for instance, the test has isolated 9/0/8 in row 6-7 left, but if similar to trainings, this might be an overfilled "object" that should connect to a larger preserved structure touching bottom—unknown exact reason, but the sparse preservation suggests same connectivity error, leaving too few complex pockets.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **every** example. Only properties or components with evidence of interaction (e.g., one affecting the state of another, such as transformation, removal, or change in properties like pixel count or holes) are included. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., background color, which remains uniform and unchanged) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., hole changes in the large Dark Red, which decrease in some pairs but not others) are noted as unknown where applicable. No high-level puzzle solution or speculation beyond direct observations is provided. Positions are treated as properties (e.g., bbox coordinates) that may link to changes.

1. **Large Dark Red block (bbox=[0,0,15,15]) ↔ Scattered single-pixel colored clusters (e.g., Yellow, Blue, Light Blue, Pink, Orange, Red, Maroon)**:
   - Interaction: The pixel count of the large Dark Red consistently increases in every output compared to its input counterpart (e.g., +79 in train 1, +25 in train 2, +81 in train 3). Simultaneously, a subset of the single-pixel colored clusters (all with pixels=1, holes=0) is consistently removed (e.g., 20+ removed in train 1, 5 in train 2, 10+ in train 3), with no new clusters added. Persistent clusters remain at their exact input positions, colors, and properties.
   - Properties involved: Pixel count (increases for Dark Red), presence/absence (removal for some colored clusters), position (bbox of removed/persistent clusters within [0,0,15,15]; no movement observed).
   - Consistency: Occurs in every pair; removed clusters are always single-pixel and colored (non-Dark Red, non-Green). Exact mechanism (e.g., why the Dark Red pixel increase does not numerically match removed pixel totals in all cases, such as train 2's +25 vs. 5 removed) is unknown.

2. **Small Dark Red cluster (bbox=[0,0,2,2], pixels=5 or 6, holes=0) ↔ No other elements**:
   - Interaction: None observed; this cluster is consistently present in every input and output, with unchanged position, pixel count (within each pair: 6 in trains 1/2, 5 in train 3), holes, and bbox. It overlaps positionally with the Green cluster but shows no effect on or from it or any other element.
   - Properties involved: Position (fixed top-left), pixel count (fixed within pair).
   - Consistency: Unchanged across all pairs, indicating isolation from transformations affecting other components.

3. **Green cluster (bbox=[0,0,3,3], pixels=7, holes=0) ↔ No other elements**:
   - Interaction: None observed; this cluster is consistently present in every input and output, with unchanged position, pixel count, holes, and bbox. It overlaps positionally with the small Dark Red but shows no effect on or from it, the large Dark Red, or any colored clusters.
   - Properties involved: Position (fixed top-left), pixel count (fixed at 7), shape properties (bbox and holes fixed).
   - Consistency: Unchanged across all pairs, indicating isolation from transformations affecting other components.

4. **Holes in large Dark Red block (bbox=[0,0,15,15]) ↔ Scattered single-pixel colored clusters**:
   - Interaction: Potential positional influence, as hole count in the large Dark Red changes in some pairs alongside colored cluster removals (e.g., decreases from 2 to 0 in train 1, 3 to 2 in train 3), but remains the same (3 to 3) in train 2 despite removals. No direct causal link (e.g., specific positions or colors filling holes) is consistently observable across all.
   - Properties involved: Hole count (varies), position (bbox of colored clusters relative to large Dark Red).
   - Consistency: Changes co-occur with colored cluster removals in every pair, but the direction/magnitude is not consistent; mechanism unknown.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., no color-to-color effects, no consistent position-to-transformation rules like adjacency causing removal, no shape properties like edges or silhouettes affecting changes across all examples, no multi-pixel non-Dark Red/Green clusters persisting or interacting consistently). Elements without any observed effect on others (e.g., isolated single pixels that always persist) are not listed as they lack interconnection.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 04:45:56] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 04:46:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating Python code containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The goal is to solve the puzzle by analyzing grids, extracting relevant features, and applying rules to generate expected results, but the previous attempt failed entirely due to structural issues in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a 'program' function explicitly, as its absence causes evaluation errors across all examples— this is a core structural requirement that's easy to miss if focusing only on puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid processing (e.g., List[List[int]] inputs representing visual scenes), where rules include identifying objects, counting features like holes or blobs, and applying transformations or matches based on training examples.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must match expected puzzle solutions exactly (e.g., specific formats for object extraction or pattern recognition); partial logic won't pass if the 'program' wrapper is missing.
 * Considerations across attempts: No actual puzzle-solving logic was executed due to the error, so we need to prioritize code structure first, then grid analysis (e.g., finding connected components, boundaries, or keys in the grid).
 * Ensure generated code is valid Python that can be run without syntax errors; test mentally by simulating grid inputs and verifying if outputs align with puzzle rules like object omission or shape matching.
 * All examples (training 1-3 and test) failed identically, indicating a systemic issue rather than input-specific logic flaws.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked any structure. Future attempts should include basics like grid parsing or object extraction, e.g.:

```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # Placeholder: Extract connected components or blobs from grid
    # Return list of dicts with features like position, size, holes
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated program had no 'program' function at all, leading to identical errors for all training examples and the test input— this is a complete structural failure, not a logic issue.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were produced beyond errors, so no puzzle rules could be tested or validated.
 * No helpful functions were included (e.g., no grid parsing, object detection, or rule application), making the attempt useless for progress.
 * Unhelpful/ broken: The entire generated code is invalid for the puzzle, as it doesn't meet the basic requirement of containing 'program'—do not reuse or build on it without adding the function.
 * Missed the fundamental need to wrap puzzle logic in 'program', which blocked any evaluation of subtle rules like object feature counting or pattern matching.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates no puzzle solution was attempted or generated.
 * Expected: A valid output based on running puzzle rules over the test grid (e.g., extracted objects, matched patterns, or transformed grid), but nothing was produced, so it fails to handle the test input entirely.
 * This error persists across all cases, confirming the code doesn't address core puzzle elements like grid analysis; we must ensure 'program' processes the test input correctly in future attempts.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 04:46:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 05:27:13] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 05:27:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating Python code containing a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual patterns or objects) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case. The goal is to solve the puzzle logic by iteratively improving the code based on failures in matching expected grid transformations or extractions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must explicitly define a function named 'program' (e.g., def program(...): ...) to be valid; without it, all evaluations fail with an error, regardless of other logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid manipulation, such as identifying objects, blobs, holes, or patterns in 2D lists of integers (e.g., 0s for empty, 1s for filled cells), and transforming or extracting features to match expected outputs.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must exactly match expected formats (e.g., specific grid representations or counts); partial matches or formatting differences cause failures. Grids may have varying sizes, rotations, or asymmetries that require robust parsing. Easy to miss: Edge cases like disconnected components, varying object sizes, or non-standard encodings (e.g., negative numbers or special symbols).
 * Considerations across attempts: No successful runs mean core structure (function definition) is missing; future code must include input handling (e.g., reading grids as List[List[int]]), processing logic (e.g., flood-fill for objects, counting features), and output generation (e.g., printing or returning transformed grids). Avoid hardcoding; use loops for grid traversal.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in this attempt, as all code failed basic validation. In future attempts, consider standard tools like flood-fill for object detection:
```python
def flood_fill(grid, start_row, start_col, visited):
    # Stack-based flood fill to identify connected components (blobs/objects)
    stack = [(start_row, start_col)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.pop()
        if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]) and not visited[r][c] and grid[r][c] == 1:
            visited[r][c] = True
            component.append((r, c))
            stack.extend([(r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)])
    return component
```

```python
def count_holes(grid):
    # Example for counting enclosed empty spaces (0s) in filled areas
    # Implementation depends on puzzle specifics; use DFS/BFS to detect cycles
    pass  # Placeholder; actual logic needed for puzzle
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating no code was produced with the required function definition.
 * Nothing worked: Zero successful outputs, so no puzzle logic was tested or validated.
 * The attempts demonstrate a complete lack of basic structure; no grid processing, object extraction, or output generation occurred.
 * No unhelpful functions were generated, but any future code without 'program' is broken and irrelevant—do not use partial snippets without the main function wrapper.
 * Core issue: Failure to include the entry-point function prevents any evaluation of puzzle-solving logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct because it indicates the code is invalid and unexecutable—no puzzle solution was attempted or generated.
 * Expected test output is unknown without puzzle details, but it should be a valid processed grid or feature extraction (e.g., a transformed 2D list matching visual rules); the error means nothing was produced to compare.
 * This failure blocks any assessment of correctness; future attempts must fix the function definition to even evaluate if the test output (e.g., object counts, pattern matches) aligns with puzzle rules like symmetry or hole detection.

[2025-10-03 05:27:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 05:56:08] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 05:56:40] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of Python code that defines a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual patterns or objects) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case. The goal is to analyze grids, extract or manipulate elements according to puzzle rules, and ensure the code structure meets the evaluator's requirements, such as including the mandatory 'program' function.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of logic correctness.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid processing (e.g., List[List[int]] inputs representing visual scenes with objects, shapes, or patterns), where rules may include identifying blobs, holes, connections, or omissions based on visual cues.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure outputs match exact expected formats for training and test (e.g., specific strings, numbers, or structures); grids may have varying sizes, requiring robust handling of edges, rotations, or symmetries.
 * Consider edge cases like empty grids, single-cell objects, or disconnected components; visual puzzles often penalize off-by-one errors in counting or positioning.
 * All attempts must pass training examples first to validate understanding before tackling the test; failures indicate missing core structure or logic.
 * Outputs should be deterministic and reproducible; random or incomplete generations won't align with expected results.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions, types, or tools were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked any valid structure. Future attempts should include basics like grid parsing (e.g., iterating over rows/columns) and object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed with the same error: "Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating a complete structural failure—no valid code was produced.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated beyond errors, so no puzzle logic (e.g., grid analysis, pattern matching) was tested or demonstrated.
 * The attempt showed zero understanding of the required code format, focusing perhaps on content without the essential wrapper function.
 * No functions were provided (helpful or otherwise), so nothing to reuse or avoid; all generations were invalid from the start.
 * This structural issue superseded any potential logic, making it impossible to evaluate puzzle-solving elements like object extraction or rule application.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates no executable code was produced to process the test grid.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, no analysis of the test input grid (e.g., identifying patterns, counting elements, or applying visual rules) could occur, so the output cannot match any expected puzzle solution.
 * The error prevents verification of whether the test would handle subtle grid features (e.g., irregular shapes or hidden objects), confirming the attempt failed to even reach the puzzle logic stage.

[2025-10-03 05:56:40] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle task where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects, blobs, or patterns) to produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The puzzle involves understanding and applying rules to extract, manipulate, or match elements in these grids, but the previous attempt failed at the fundamental level of code structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations (training and test) fail with an error, regardless of puzzle logic.
 * Grids are represented as lists of lists of integers (e.g., List[List[int]]), likely encoding visual features like colors, shapes, holes, or boundaries that need to be parsed into higher-level puzzle elements.
 * Puzzle rules probably involve identifying and extracting "objects" or "blobs" (connected components), counting features like holes, and applying transformations or matches based on keys or patterns—subtleties include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or components that don't span the full grid.
 * Outputs must match expected results exactly for training examples (which are not shown here but implied to be specific grid manipulations) and the test input; mismatches could stem from incorrect object detection, omission of certain elements, or failure to account for connectivity rules (e.g., 4-connected vs. 8-connected pixels).
 * Consider iterative refinement: mentally simulate grid processing to verify logic, as errors in extraction can propagate to all outputs.
 * All attempts so far show no successful processing, so focus on basic code validity before puzzle-specific logic like hole counting or shape matching.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions, types, or tools were generated in the previous attempt, as the code failed to define the required 'program' function. Future attempts should start with a skeleton like:

```python
def program(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Placeholder: implement grid processing here
    return grid  # Or transformed output
```

Functions like object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for blobs or hole detection) would be essential but are absent; avoid assuming untested tools without validation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed with the same error: "Generated code does not contain 'program' function," indicating a complete structural failure rather than puzzle logic issues.
 * Nothing worked: no outputs were generated, so no partial credit for logic, extraction, or matching.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the code requirements, let alone the puzzle rules, as it didn't produce any valid program to evaluate.
 * No functions for extracting objects (e.g., identifying blobs, counting holes, or detecting dividers) were included, making the code irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * This is the only attempt referenced, but it highlights the need to prioritize code format over premature puzzle solving.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense as a valid result—it indicates the code couldn't even be executed, so no puzzle processing occurred.
 * Without a proper output, it's impossible to verify if it matches the expected test result (e.g., a transformed grid accounting for objects, holes, or patterns); this is fundamentally different from any expected valid output, which should be a processed grid.
 * The error suggests the test case (an unseen grid) wasn't handled at all, missing all puzzle elements like object extraction or rule application—future attempts must ensure the 'program' function exists to even attempt matching the test.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of Python code that defines a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The goal is to analyze grids, extract or manipulate elements according to puzzle rules, and output results that match expected patterns, but the previous attempt failed due to a fundamental structural issue in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must include a 'program' function as the entry point; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of logic.
 * Grids are represented as List[List[int]], where values likely encode visual features (e.g., 0 for empty, positive ints for object types, colors, or shapes).
 * Puzzle rules probably involve identifying and extracting "objects" (connected components or blobs) from the grid, counting features like holes or sizes, and applying transformations or matches to a "key" pattern.
 * Subtle elements: Handle edge cases like disconnected objects, irregular shapes, or grids where objects don't span the full width/height; ensure outputs preserve grid dimensions or format exactly (e.g., no extra spaces or modified boundaries).
 * Outputs should be grids or simplified representations that visually or structurally match expectations, potentially omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching a key criteria like hole count).
 * Consider rotational symmetry, mirroring, or adjacency rules for object validation, as visual puzzles often include these.
 * All training examples and test must pass independently; partial logic won't suffice if the function is missing.

                hole_count = count_holes(component, grid)  # Custom function to detect enclosed zeros
                objects.append(GridObject(component, hole_count, len(component)))
    return objects
```

```python

    # Placeholder: Analyze bounding box of component for enclosed empty cells (0s)
    # This is subtle and easy to miss—holes are internal voids, not external spaces
    min_r, max_r = min(p[0] for p in component), max(p[0] for p in component)
    min_c, max_c = min(p[1] for p in component), max(p[1] for p in component)
    internal_zeros = 0
    for r in range(min_r + 1, max_r):  # Skip borders
        for c in range(min_c + 1, max_c):
            if grid[r][c] == 0 and is_enclosed((r, c), component):  # Check if surrounded
                internal_zeros += 1
    return internal_zeros // 4  # Approximate for 4-connected holes; refine based on puzzle
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated program lacked the required 'program' function entirely, causing immediate errors across all training examples and the test input.
 * No object extraction or grid processing logic was present, so nothing worked—complete structural failure.
 * No evidence of understanding grid representation or visual rules; code was invalid Python for the puzzle framework.
 * Function to extract objects wasn't attempted, which is essential for identifying blobs, holes, or matches in visual puzzles.
 * All attempts (only one shown) resulted in the same error, indicating no progress on core requirements.
 * The extract_objects function (not used) would be helpful, but without it, puzzles involving connected components can't be solved.
 * No unhelpful functions were generated, but future attempts should avoid incomplete code skeletons without the 'program' entry point.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not look correct because it indicates a total failure to produce valid, runnable code.
 * No actual output grid or processed result was generated, so it can't be compared to expected puzzle solution (e.g., a transformed grid matching visual rules).
 * This differs from expectations: The test input grid should yield a specific output (e.g., extracted objects or a modified grid omitting invalid elements), but instead, evaluation halted early—likely the expected output involves applying rules like hole counting or shape matching, which wasn't reached.
 * The error persists across all cases, confirming the code doesn't handle any input correctly, including the test's unique grid features (e.g., possibly irregular objects or a key pattern).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of a Python program with a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs, likely involving object extraction, pattern recognition, or manipulation for training examples and a test case. The goal is to produce correct outputs that match expected puzzle rules, but the previous attempt failed entirely due to structural issues in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a 'program' function, as this is the entry point expected by the evaluator; without it, all runs fail with errors.
 * Puzzle likely involves grids (e.g., List[List[int]]) representing visual elements like objects, blobs, holes, or dividers, requiring extraction and analysis to determine outputs like shapes, counts, or omissions.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases such as incomplete stretches across grids, mismatched shapes, or specific omission rules (e.g., ignoring objects not matching criteria like hole counts or keys).
 * Ensure outputs for training examples pass without errors before testing; failures indicate basic structural or rule misunderstandings.
 * Consider grid symmetries, blob connectivity, or key components that may not span the entire grid, which could lead to incorrect extractions.
 * All attempts must mentally simulate puzzle rules (e.g., object detection, counting features) on inputs to verify outputs, noting differences explicitly.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating a complete structural failure in code generation.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated at all, so no partial matches, object extractions, or rule applications could be evaluated.
 * The attempt demonstrated zero understanding of the code requirements, as even basic function definition was missing.
 * No helpful functions were produced; any attempted code (not shown) is irrelevant or broken due to lacking the core 'program' function.
 * Subtle issue: Without the 'program' function, no mental simulation or rule application could occur, blocking all progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates no processing happened at all.
 * Expected test output should be a valid puzzle result (e.g., a string describing extracted objects or a pattern match), but this error means the program couldn't run, missing all key elements like object detection or rule-based output.
 * This failure highlights the need to prioritize code structure; without it, test cases can't be handled, regardless of puzzle rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating Python code containing a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual elements like objects or patterns) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test input. The goal is to solve the puzzle by analyzing grids, extracting relevant features, and applying rules to generate expected results, but the previous attempt failed entirely due to structural issues in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a 'program' function explicitly, as its absence causes evaluation errors across all examples— this is a core structural requirement that's easy to miss if focusing only on puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid processing (e.g., List[List[int]] inputs representing visual scenes), where rules include identifying objects, counting features like holes or blobs, and applying transformations or matches based on training examples.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must match expected puzzle solutions exactly (e.g., specific formats for object extraction or pattern recognition); partial logic won't pass if the 'program' wrapper is missing.
 * Considerations across attempts: No actual puzzle-solving logic was executed due to the error, so we need to prioritize code structure first, then grid analysis (e.g., finding connected components, boundaries, or keys in the grid).
 * Ensure generated code is valid Python that can be run without syntax errors; test mentally by simulating grid inputs and verifying if outputs align with puzzle rules like object omission or shape matching.
 * All examples (training 1-3 and test) failed identically, indicating a systemic issue rather than input-specific logic flaws.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked any structure. Future attempts should include basics like grid parsing or object extraction, e.g.:

```python
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # Placeholder: Extract connected components or blobs from grid
    # Return list of dicts with features like position, size, holes
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated program had no 'program' function at all, leading to identical errors for all training examples and the test input— this is a complete structural failure, not a logic issue.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were produced beyond errors, so no puzzle rules could be tested or validated.
 * No helpful functions were included (e.g., no grid parsing, object detection, or rule application), making the attempt useless for progress.
 * Unhelpful/ broken: The entire generated code is invalid for the puzzle, as it doesn't meet the basic requirement of containing 'program'—do not reuse or build on it without adding the function.
 * Missed the fundamental need to wrap puzzle logic in 'program', which blocked any evaluation of subtle rules like object feature counting or pattern matching.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates no puzzle solution was attempted or generated.
 * Expected: A valid output based on running puzzle rules over the test grid (e.g., extracted objects, matched patterns, or transformed grid), but nothing was produced, so it fails to handle the test input entirely.
 * This error persists across all cases, confirming the code doesn't address core puzzle elements like grid analysis; we must ensure 'program' processes the test input correctly in future attempts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that requires generating Python code containing a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual patterns or objects) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case. The goal is to solve the puzzle logic by iteratively improving the code based on failures in matching expected grid transformations or extractions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must explicitly define a function named 'program' (e.g., def program(...): ...) to be valid; without it, all evaluations fail with an error, regardless of other logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid manipulation, such as identifying objects, blobs, holes, or patterns in 2D lists of integers (e.g., 0s for empty, 1s for filled cells), and transforming or extracting features to match expected outputs.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must exactly match expected formats (e.g., specific grid representations or counts); partial matches or formatting differences cause failures. Grids may have varying sizes, rotations, or asymmetries that require robust parsing. Easy to miss: Edge cases like disconnected components, varying object sizes, or non-standard encodings (e.g., negative numbers or special symbols).
 * Considerations across attempts: No successful runs mean core structure (function definition) is missing; future code must include input handling (e.g., reading grids as List[List[int]]), processing logic (e.g., flood-fill for objects, counting features), and output generation (e.g., printing or returning transformed grids). Avoid hardcoding; use loops for grid traversal.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in this attempt, as all code failed basic validation. In future attempts, consider standard tools like flood-fill for object detection:
```python
def flood_fill(grid, start_row, start_col, visited):
    # Stack-based flood fill to identify connected components (blobs/objects)
    stack = [(start_row, start_col)]
    component = []
    while stack:
        r, c = stack.pop()
        if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]) and not visited[r][c] and grid[r][c] == 1:
            visited[r][c] = True
            component.append((r, c))
            stack.extend([(r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)])
    return component
```

```python
def count_holes(grid):
    # Example for counting enclosed empty spaces (0s) in filled areas
    # Implementation depends on puzzle specifics; use DFS/BFS to detect cycles
    pass  # Placeholder; actual logic needed for puzzle
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and test input failed with "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating no code was produced with the required function definition.
 * Nothing worked: Zero successful outputs, so no puzzle logic was tested or validated.
 * The attempts demonstrate a complete lack of basic structure; no grid processing, object extraction, or output generation occurred.
 * No unhelpful functions were generated, but any future code without 'program' is broken and irrelevant—do not use partial snippets without the main function wrapper.
 * Core issue: Failure to include the entry-point function prevents any evaluation of puzzle-solving logic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct because it indicates the code is invalid and unexecutable—no puzzle solution was attempted or generated.
 * Expected test output is unknown without puzzle details, but it should be a valid processed grid or feature extraction (e.g., a transformed 2D list matching visual rules); the error means nothing was produced to compare.
 * This failure blocks any assessment of correctness; future attempts must fix the function definition to even evaluate if the test output (e.g., object counts, pattern matches) aligns with puzzle rules like symmetry or hole detection.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of Python code that defines a specific 'program' function to process grid-based inputs (likely representing visual patterns or objects) and produce correct outputs for training examples and a test case. The goal is to analyze grids, extract or manipulate elements according to puzzle rules, and ensure the code structure meets the evaluator's requirements, such as including the mandatory 'program' function.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail immediately, regardless of logic correctness.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid processing (e.g., List[List[int]] inputs representing visual scenes with objects, shapes, or patterns), where rules may include identifying blobs, holes, connections, or omissions based on visual cues.
 * Subtle elements: Ensure outputs match exact expected formats for training and test (e.g., specific strings, numbers, or structures); grids may have varying sizes, requiring robust handling of edges, rotations, or symmetries.
 * Consider edge cases like empty grids, single-cell objects, or disconnected components; visual puzzles often penalize off-by-one errors in counting or positioning.
 * All attempts must pass training examples first to validate understanding before tackling the test; failures indicate missing core structure or logic.
 * Outputs should be deterministic and reproducible; random or incomplete generations won't align with expected results.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions, types, or tools were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked any valid structure. Future attempts should include basics like grid parsing (e.g., iterating over rows/columns) and object extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples (1, 2, 3) and the test input failed with the same error: "Generated code does not contain 'program' function", indicating a complete structural failure—no valid code was produced.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated beyond errors, so no puzzle logic (e.g., grid analysis, pattern matching) was tested or demonstrated.
 * The attempt showed zero understanding of the required code format, focusing perhaps on content without the essential wrapper function.
 * No functions were provided (helpful or otherwise), so nothing to reuse or avoid; all generations were invalid from the start.
 * This structural issue superseded any potential logic, making it impossible to evaluate puzzle-solving elements like object extraction or rule application.

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in "ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function", which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates no executable code was produced to process the test grid.
 * Without a valid 'program' function, no analysis of the test input grid (e.g., identifying patterns, counting elements, or applying visual rules) could occur, so the output cannot match any expected puzzle solution.
 * The error prevents verification of whether the test would handle subtle grid features (e.g., irregular shapes or hidden objects), confirming the attempt failed to even reach the puzzle logic stage.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the input is a 16x16 grid containing 0s (empty/unfilled cells), 7s (background or wall cells), and numbers 1-9 (likely clues, objects, or barriers). The goal is to produce an output grid by filling certain 0s with 7s to distinguish exterior/unbounded regions from internal enclosed regions, while preserving numbers 1-9 and existing 7s unchanged; internal 0 regions that are fully enclosed (not connected to the border) should remain 0, forming shapes or "rooms" around or between numbered clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s represent traversable empty space for flooding/propagation, but only those connected to the grid border should be filled with 7 (exterior region); disconnected internal 0 clusters must remain 0 to match enclosed areas in expected outputs.
 * Numbers 1-9 act as barriers: the flood cannot pass through or over them (they block adjacency for 0-paths), and they remain unchanged in the output.
 * 7s are pre-filled background/walls: they block flooding (cannot traverse them) but may influence starting points for the fill.
 * Subtlety: Defining "connected to border" is critical and tricky—simple adjacency via 0-paths to border 0s may miss regions adjacent only to border 7s or border numbers; conversely, over-seeding from border 7s can incorrectly fill internal regions by treating border-adjacent 0s as exterior even if isolated internally.
 * The grid borders themselves may contain 0s, 7s, or numbers, complicating seeding: if a border cell is a number, adjacent internal 0s might need filling if considered exterior, but this risks over-filling.
 * No diagonal movement: flooding uses 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).
 * Multiple disconnected 0 regions exist; only the one touching the border gets filled—internal ones stay 0, often forming blob-like shapes in expected outputs (e.g., surrounding numbers without touching borders).
 * Potential for 2x2 or larger empty internal areas that must remain 0; over-filling these violates the enclosure rule.
 * The puzzle may involve implicit rules like no touching islands or connected sea, but based on outputs, the core is exterior vs. interior 0 regions.
 * Visually, expected outputs show 0s clustering into enclosed "pockets" (e.g., around numbers in ex2 upper grid, or linear paths in ex1 lower grid), suggesting the fill must precisely avoid crossing number barriers.
 * Copying the grid is essential to avoid mutating the input.
 * Visited tracking prevents revisiting and ensures efficient BFS/DFS flooding.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is useful for safe grid duplication before modification.)

```python
def fill_exterior_0s(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    q = deque()
    # (Current seeding logic, but flawed: starts from border 0 or 7)
    # ... (rest of BFS as in attempt)
    return h
```
(This BFS flood-fill structure is helpful and core to the problem, as it correctly handles 4-dir propagation through 0s and visited tracking; it just needs seeding and enqueue conditions fixed to properly distinguish exterior from interior. Use DFS as alternative if needed for recursion.)

(No other functions like object extraction are present or needed; the problem doesn't require identifying or counting objects around numbers—it's purely about regional filling of 0s.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses a BFS flood-fill starting from all border cells that are 0 or 7, propagating only through unvisited 0s and setting them to 7; this partially understands the exterior-filling concept but fails consistently due to incorrect seeding, leading to under-filling in some cases and over-filling in others.
 * In training example 1: Generated under-filled (left 0s remaining) in row 6 (cols 3-6 and 9-10 as 0,0,0,0 and 0,0) and mismatched lower regions (e.g., row 7 has 0s at cols 3-6,9-10,13 but expected has all 7s in row 6 and specific 0s only in lower rows like row 7 cols 14-15, row 9 cols 14-15, row 10 col 15, row 11 cols 8-11,13-15, etc.); upper rows 0-5 mostly match, but the fill didn't reach some exterior 0s (possibly due to number barriers or seeding missing border numbers), while incorrectly leaving internal-adjacent 0s unfilled when expected treats them as exterior.
 * In training example 2: Generated over-filled massively (e.g., row 1 all 7s except numbers, but expected has 0s at cols 6-8 and 12-14; row 2 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols 7-8,13,15? Wait, col15 is 4 in expected? Actually cols 7-8=0,0 and col13=0? No, expected row2: 0s at 6? Wait, [5,7,6,3,7,7,1,0,0,7,7,7,6,0,4,7] so 0s at cols7-8,13; generated has all 7s there), turning most internal 0 clusters to 7 when expected preserves them as enclosed regions (e.g., 0s forming shapes around numbers in rows 1-7 and separate pockets in rows 9-14); this suggests seeding from border 7s incorrectly treated internal components adjacent to background as exterior.
 * In training example 3: Generated over-filled internal areas (e.g., row 5 all 7s except some numbers like 5,9,5 but expected has 0s at cols1-5; row 7 has no 0s but expected has 0s at cols1-2? Wait, expected row6: [7,0,0,0,0,0,7,...] so 0s cols1-5, but generated row6? Wait, rows are 0-indexed, generated row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,9,7,5,7] filled to 7s where expected has 0s; lower rows like 9-15 have some 0s filled differently, e.g., row9 generated has 0s at cols9-12 but expected has more structured 0s in cols1-3,4-5?); upper rows 0-3 mostly match, but fill invaded enclosed 0 pockets (e.g., row6-9 expected 0 clusters around numbers, but generated filled them).
 * Overall, the attempt demonstrates understanding of BFS for regional filling and barrier handling (numbers/7s not traversed), but misses subtle seeding: including border 7s causes over-filling of near-border internals in ex2/ex3, while failing to fill some exterior 0s in ex1 (possibly because those 0s are only adjacent to border numbers, not enqueued); no object extraction needed, as numbers stay fixed—no counting holes or blobs required.
 * The copy_grid function works correctly and should be retained; fill_exterior_0s is mostly helpful but broken in seeding/enqueue logic (don't use as-is; modify to experiment with seeding only border 0s or all border cells).
 * No unhelpful functions present, but the current enqueue condition (only if h[nr][nc] == 0) is correct—don't change that; the issue is solely in initial queue population.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct based on patterns from training examples; it over-fills some internal 0s (e.g., row 5 has isolated 0 at col1? Wait, row5: [9,0,7,7,...] leaves one 0 but fills around it, while expected likely wants enclosed clusters like in ex3 row5; row6: [7,8,7,0,0,7,...] leaves 0s at cols3-4 but fills others, potentially invading what should be internal pockets similar to ex2's preserved 0 shapes).
 * It under-fills or mismatches in lower rows (e.g., row12: [5,7,7,5,0,7,...] leaves scattered 0s, but training patterns suggest more structured enclosed 0s or full filling of exterior chains); overall, it resembles the over-filling in ex2/ex3 (many 7s with sparse 0s) rather than balanced exterior-only fill, so it likely incorrectly treats some internal regions as exterior due to seeding flaws—e.g., 0s in rows 6-9 cols3-4 seem like a small pocket that might should remain if enclosed, but without exact expected, it doesn't match the "enclosed blobs" subtlety seen in training.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 16x16 grid where numbers 0-9 represent colored pixels (likely with 7 as a background or "dark red" color), and the goal is to process the grid by selectively filling certain small, isolated connected components of non-7 pixels with 7 to remove noise or "absorbed blobs," while preserving larger structures, fixed elements (e.g., green components or specific shapes), and avoiding over-filling that alters intended features.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 4-connectivity for connected components of non-7 cells to identify blobs or objects.
 * Small components (e.g., noise or artifacts) should be absorbed into 7, but the size threshold (e.g., <=2 pixels) may be incorrect or context-dependent; some small blobs are filled in expected outputs, while others (possibly touching borders or specific colors) are preserved.
 * Preserve larger components (e.g., green areas, which are not small) and fixed elements like structural bars or shapes; do not absorb everything non-7.
 * Subtle changes occur beyond simple absorption: in some cases, positions that were 7 in input become non-7 in expected (e.g., revealing or adjusting pixels), or specific small blobs are not filled if they form part of a larger pattern/key.
 * Bbox checks (e.g., inside 0-15) are always true on a 16x16 grid and unhelpful; focus on component size, isolation, and possibly color (numbers) uniformity.
 * Grids have vertical/horizontal structures (e.g., left columns with 3s or 7s), and absorption seems targeted at "floating" small blobs not connected to main objects.
 * Expected outputs often expand 7 areas in lower/mid sections but retain or adjust upper blobs; over-absorption can change intended pixels (e.g., turning a key pixel to 7 when it should stay).
 * Consider color-specific rules: numbers like 0 might be neutral/background variants, while others (1-6,8,9) are distinct objects; 7 is dominant background.
 * Border-touching components might be preserved differently; some small components in expected are filled only if fully enclosed.
 * No rotation, shifting, or complex math observed—just selective filling and possible minor adjustments for puzzle "cleaning."

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt focused on absorbing small (<=2 pixel) non-7 components into 7 using 4-connectivity, with preservation of larger elements; get_non_seven_components is helpful for blob extraction but overall logic failed all training examples.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and processes some small isolated blobs (e.g., partial filling in mid-sections of train1 and train2), and preserves large components like potential green areas.
 * What didn't work: Over-absorbs or under-absorbs—e.g., in train1, generated sets position (0,0) to 7 (should be 4), fails to fill lower blobs like row7 col14-15 (0,0 should be 7s but generated keeps them), and leaves row2 col13-15 as 0,4,0 (should be 7s); mismatches in rows 6-16 where expected has more uniform 7s in mid-right but generated retains scattered non-7s.
 * In train2, generated sets row0 col1 to 7 (should be 9), fails to fill small blobs in rows 12-15 (e.g., row12 col15=0 should be 7, but generated keeps it), and incorrectly fills row15 entirely to 7s (expected keeps some 0s in col11-15); under-fills upper left blobs.
 * In train3, generated keeps too many small blobs (e.g., row1 col9-15 as 0,8,0,... should be mostly 7s), sets row0 col1 to 7 (should be 6), and fails to fill mid components like row5 col1-5 (0s should be 7s); over-preserves scattered 0s in lower rows.
 * component_bbox_inside_large is unhelpful/broken (always true, adds no value—avoid in future).
 * is_small_component threshold too strict; misses that some "small" components in expected are filled differently based on enclosure or color.
 * preserve_fixed_elements does nothing useful (just returns input—redundant).
 * absorb_small_components core idea is partially right (noise removal) but lacks subtlety like color checks or border rules; leads to mismatches in all cases.
 * No extraction of specific objects (e.g., by color) attempted, which may be needed for distinguishing absorbable vs. preserved blobs.
 * Train1: Generated has extra non-7s in lower half (e.g., row11 col0-15 scattered 0s/1s kept, should be more 7s) and wrong top-left adjustment.
 * Train2: Mismatches top row (7 vs. 9 at (0,1)) and bottom rows (over-fills row15 to all 7s, expected retains 8,0,0,0,0).
 * Train3: Keeps too many upper/mid small components (e.g., row1 col7-15 non-7s vs. expected 7s), unknown reason for partial fills.
 * Overall, attempt shows basic understanding of components but poor matching; differences are specific pixel changes (e.g., 7->non-7 or vice versa) without clear pattern.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it retains many scattered small non-7 components (e.g., row1 col6-15: 0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,7 should likely be more 7s based on training patterns of filling isolated blobs), over-preserves upper left (e.g., row1 col2=5, row2 col1=4 kept, but expected likely fills to 7 like train3 upper), and leaves lower right noisy (e.g., row12 col13=9, row13 col9=8 kept as small blobs, probably should absorb to 7). 
 * It fails to uniform-ize mid sections (e.g., row6-10 col6-9 have mixed 0s/non-7s, expected would fill small ones per training). 
 * Looks like partial absorption happened (e.g., some 7 expansions in row4-5), but inconsistencies (e.g., row7 col1=8 kept) suggest wrong threshold or no color/object distinction; does not make sense as a "cleaned" puzzle grid compared to expected training patterns of broader 7 fills in enclosed areas.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 16x16 grid of integer values representing colored pixels, where the goal is to process the grid by absorbing certain connected components of non-7 pixels (likely non-dark-red elements) into 7, while preserving specific components that touch borders, are single pixels on edges, or are in special regions like the top-left, based on rules inferred from training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule 1: Absorb internal (non-border-touching) connected components of non-7 pixels into 7; components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right), and only non-7 pixels are considered part of a component—7 acts as a barrier.
 * Core rule 2: Preserve small components in the top-left area (e.g., 4x4 region) even if internal, possibly due to overlapping bounding boxes of dark red (7) and green (or other colors) elements; this prevents over-absorption in that zone.
 * Core rule 3: Preserve single-pixel non-7 components on the canvas borders (rows 0/15 or columns 0/15), but absorb internal single pixels; also, preserve larger border-touching components entirely.
 * Subtlety: Components touching any border pixel must be fully preserved (not absorbed), even if mostly internal; the find_component function correctly tracks this via touches_border flag.
 * Subtlety: The absorption happens only for components where all pixels are non-7 and the entire component doesn't touch the border; 7 pixels are not part of any component and block connectivity.
 * Easy to miss: Edge singles are checked after absorption, but the code's preserve_edge_singles also absorbs internal singles redundantly—order matters, as absorption should precede edge preservation.
 * Easy to miss: Top-left preservation is a no-op in the code (just a pass), but examples show top-left patterns remain unchanged, suggesting the absorption rule alone might handle it if components there touch implicit borders or are special.
 * Consideration: Grids have scattered non-7 pixels forming "objects" or clusters; expected outputs show some internal clusters absorbed (turned to 7) while border-connected or special ones stay.
 * Consideration: No diagonal connectivity—only orthogonal neighbors.
 * Potential issue: The code runs absorption first, then top-left (no-op), then edge singles, but examples suggest more nuanced preservation, like not absorbing certain multi-pixel internal groups if they are "small" or in specific positions.
 * From examples: In training 1, bottom rows have preserved patterns (e.g., row 11 has 0s preserved differently); in training 2, a large central structure is partially preserved with specific colors; in training 3, upper components are absorbed more aggressively in generated vs. expected.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def is_border(i: int, j: int, n: int = 16) -> bool:
    return i == 0 or i == n - 1 or j == 0 or j == n - 1

def get_neighbors(i: int, j: int, n: int = 16) -> List[tuple]:
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    neighbors = []
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n:
            neighbors.append((ni, nj))
    return neighbors

def find_component(grid: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, visited: List[List[bool]], n: int) -> tuple:
    component = []
    touches_border = is_border(i, j, n)
    q = deque([(i, j)])
    visited[i][j] = True
    component.append((i, j))
    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()
        for nx, ny in get_neighbors(x, y, n):
            if not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] != 7:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
                component.append((nx, ny))
                if is_border(nx, ny, n):
                    touches_border = True
    return component, touches_border
```
These functions are helpful for identifying connected components and checking border touches using BFS; they correctly model 4-connectivity and ignore 7s.

```python
def absorb_internal_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Handles rule 1: Absorb internal small colored pixel clusters into large dark red by setting non-border-touching non-7 components to 7."""
    n = len(grid)
    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if result[i][j] != 7 and not visited[i][j]:
                component, touches_border = find_component(result, i, j, visited, n)
                if not touches_border:
                    for x, y in component:
                        result[x][y] = 7
    return result
```
This is helpful for the core absorption logic but may over-absorb if not combined with other rules.

The preserve_top_left_overlap and preserve_edge_singles functions are partially helpful but flawed: top-left is a no-op (unhelpful as-is), and edge singles redundantly absorbs internals without fully preserving multi-pixel border components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt models connected components and border touches correctly but fails all training examples due to over-absorption of certain internal or semi-internal clusters.
 * Train 1: Generated absorbs too much in bottom rows (e.g., row 11 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0]—extra 0s and 1 preserved incorrectly; row 12 has [9,5,0,9,0,0,8,6,7,9,0,0,8,7,6,0] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,0,0,8,7,6,0]—extra non-7s like 9,5,0 absorbed incorrectly into 7s).
 * Train 2: Generated absorbs almost everything except top-left and some bottom (e.g., rows 1-4 partially correct but row 1 has no [0,0,0,7] pattern; entire central structure in expected rows 1-7 is missing, replaced by 7s—fails to preserve a large border-touching? component).
 * Train 3: Generated preserves too many scattered pixels in upper/mid grid (e.g., row 1 has [1,7,7,3,...0,0,0,5,0,0,0] vs. expected all 7s after top-left; row 5 has [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,5,0] vs. expected mostly 7s with a separate structure starting row 6—over-preserves small internal clusters).
 * Missed full preservation of multi-pixel components that touch borders indirectly or via chains.
 * preserve_top_left_overlap is unhelpful (no-op, doesn't enforce anything).
 * preserve_edge_singles is partially helpful but broken: it checks singles post-absorption but doesn't prevent absorption of border-touching multi-pixel groups earlier; also absorbs internal singles redundantly.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond components, but find_component could be extended to list all components for debugging.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of absorption but misses nuances like preserving non-single border components and specific patterns in examples (e.g., unknown reason for row 11 differences in train 1—possibly special rule for bottom-edge clusters).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it preserves too many internal non-7 pixels (e.g., scattered 0s,1s, etc. in columns 6-9 and rows 6-15 remain as a loose structure, but expected likely absorbs most internals while keeping top-left [7,2,7,3...], the 3-square in row 3, and border touches like row 5 col 0=9).
 * It fails to absorb central/internal clusters (e.g., the vertical line of 0s in col 6 rows 0-5 should likely be absorbed if not border-touching, but stays; bottom rows have preserved 0s/1s/5s that may need absorption if internal).
 * Compared to training patterns, it over-preserves like in train 3 (scattered pixels stay), suggesting the program doesn't fully implement border-only preservation.
 * To handle test, need to ensure only border-touching components (including multi-pixel) stay, absorb all else, and check for top-left/edge specials—current output has too many non-7s in mid-grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving an N x N grid (appears to be 16x16 based on outputs) of integers where 7s act as barriers or absorbing material, and non-7 cells (0-6, 8-9) form connected structures; the goal is to process the grid by identifying and "absorbing" (filling with 7s) certain internal non-7 components while preserving others based on connectivity to grid edges, likely simulating some physical or logical rule like gravity, flooding, or structural support.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are formed by non-7 cells using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), ignoring 7s as impassable barriers.
 * The core rule appears to involve preserving non-7 components that are "attached" or reachable from specific edges (top/bottom in the attempt), while absorbing (setting to 7) isolated internal ones; however, this rule fails for cases where internal components are preserved in expected outputs despite not touching those edges.
 * Subtlety: Numbers 1-9 and 0 are treated uniformly as non-7/connectable, but 0 might represent empty space or a special case (e.g., air or void) that affects absorption differently—though the attempt doesn't distinguish them.
 * Edge touching is checked per cell in a component (any cell in row 0 or row N-1), but this over-absorbs in some cases, suggesting the rule might instead be flood-fill reachability from edges (e.g., preserve anything reachable from top/bottom without crossing 7s) rather than whole-component touching, or perhaps touching left/right sides instead.
 * Components can be complex shapes spanning multiple areas; absorbing one part shouldn't affect connected parts, but the attempt correctly uses BFS to group them.
 * Grids have consistent structure: left-side vertical structures often touch top, bottom-right or scattered blobs touch bottom, and central blobs may or may not be absorbed based on unseen rules.
 * Potential miss: Absorption might only apply to fully enclosed "holes" or floating islands not connected to any edge, but expected outputs preserve some central blobs, implying a different criterion (e.g., size threshold, or absorption propagates only from certain directions like bottom-up).
 * No modification of 7s themselves; output only changes non-7 to 7 in specific cases.
 * All examples show left-column structures (e.g., 3s) preserved, suggesting they touch top; bottom blobs sometimes preserved if touching bottom row.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly handles training example 1 by preserving top-touching and bottom-touching components while absorbing internals, matching expected fully.
 * For training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated output absorbs central components (e.g., rows 1-7, cols 6-9 with 0s,1s, etc., and scattered right-side like row2 col12-14:6,0,4) into 7s, and partially preserves bottom (rows 11-15, cols 11-15 with 0s,6,5,1,8,9 but flattens some); expected preserves a complex central hanging structure (rows 1-7, cols 6-9 and extensions like row2 col12-14, row4 col13-15:9,0, etc.) and left extensions (row2 col0=5), plus bottom-left (rows 9-14, cols 1-5 with 0s,1,5,9,8, etc.)—difference: over-absorption of central blob that doesn't touch top/bottom but is preserved in expected (reason unknown, possibly wrong edge rule or needs flood-fill from edges).
 * For training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated absorbs most internals (e.g., central rows 5-14 various 0s/numbers become 7s, preserves only left top-touching 3s/6/8 and tiny bottom-right 0s in rows 12-15 col14-15); expected preserves left top (adds row1 col0=1), plus large central-left (rows 5-11, cols 1-5 with 0s,5,2,1,5,9,6) and bottom scattered (rows 9-15, cols 9-15 with 0s,9,8,6,4,0s)—difference: absorbs preserved central components (e.g., row6 col1-5:0,0,0,0,0 and extensions) that don't touch top/bottom, plus misses adding/changing some cells like row1 col0 from 7 to 1 (unknown why); bottom 0s partially match but structure differs.
 * Overall: Component extraction via BFS is solid and essential for identifying blobs without overlap; touching check is simple but incorrect for non-top/bottom edges or reachability—leads to over-filling with 7s in internals. No unhelpful functions; all are relevant but need rule refinement (e.g., try left/right touching or multi-edge flood fill). Attempt shows partial grasp of connectivity but misses why some internals are preserved (e.g., perhaps only absorb if fully enclosed or size-based).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves left vertical structure (cols 0-3, rows 0-3: numbers like 2,5,4,3s touching top) and bottom scattered components (rows 6-15, various cols with 0s/numbers like row15 col1-15:0,0,7,0,2,7,... touching bottom), but absorbs central/mid-level blobs (e.g., rows 6-15 cols 6-9 with 0s,8,5,2,4,1,9 etc. mostly set to 7s, leaving fragments like row6 col0=9, row7 col1=8).
 * This does not look correct: Similar to train 2/3 failures, it over-absorbs internal/central structures (e.g., the dense 0s/numbers in rows 7-15 cols 6-9 and extensions like row10 col7=1, row11 col8=9) that might need preservation if the rule allows "supported" or edge-reachable internals (unknown exact reason, but pattern matches expected preservations in trains); left and bottom partial matches suggest edge-touching works, but central filling mismatches likely puzzle intent—test likely expects more preserved mid/bottom shapes like in train 2's central blob.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a 16x16 grid-based logic puzzle where input grids contain 0s (empty cells), 7s (pre-filled cells, likely representing "sea" or "exterior" filler), and scattered numbers (1-6, 8, 9 as fixed clues). The goal is to fill certain 0s with 7s based on connectivity rules to determine "exterior" or fillable regions, while leaving other 0s unfilled (likely interior or clue-related regions) and preserving all clue numbers unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 0s connected via other 0s to any border (top, bottom, left, right) should generally be filled with 7s, treating border 7s as starting points for propagation, but not all border-adjacent 0s are filled (e.g., some interior-touching border 0s remain 0 in expected outputs, suggesting over-simple flood fill overfills).
 * Propagation only through 0s (not through numbers or existing 7s beyond seeding), but seeding must include all four borders; missing bottom/right seeding leads to underfilling in enclosed-but-exterior-connected areas.
 * Clue numbers (1-6, 8, 9) must never be changed to 7; they remain fixed regardless of adjacency to 7s, indicating they define or protect interior regions (e.g., possible island clues in a Nurikabe-like puzzle where 7 is sea and 0s are island spaces).
 * Some interior regions of 0s and numbers are completely filled to 7s in expected outputs (e.g., no remaining 0s or numbers in certain blocks), suggesting rules for identifying "degenerate" or non-protected regions that get fully filled, possibly if they violate enclosure or size rules.
 * Remaining 0s form connected clusters often adjacent to or containing clue numbers, implying 0s in "protected" interior regions (enclosed by 7s) stay unfilled, potentially with subtle rules like no 2x2 0-blocks or region sizes matching clues (e.g., a "1" clue might protect a single adjacent 0 or itself).
 * Existing 7s act as barriers but also as seeds for filling adjacent 0s; interior 7s do not propagate filling unless connected via the flood (but current code doesn't seed interior 7s).
 * Easy to miss: Border 0s aren't always filled (e.g., train2 row1 0s remain 0 despite top-border proximity), so connectivity must consider enclosures created by numbers/7s; overflooding happens if ignoring that some 0s are "internal" even near borders.
 * No diagonal connectivity (only orthogonal, as in code's dirs); all changes are iterative but single-pass flood suffices if seeded correctly.
 * Across attempts, no handling for clue-based filling (e.g., expanding regions from numbers) or validation rules (e.g., ensuring no touching interiors), leading to mismatches in both over- and under-filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `fill_exterior_0s` function is partially helpful as a flood-fill base for exterior 0s but broken (incomplete border seeding leads to underfilling; fix by adding bottom/right border seeding loops similar to top/left). It correctly propagates only through 0s and preserves non-0s.

                visited[nr][nc] = True
                q.append((nr, nc))
    return h
```

No other helpful functions from the attempt; no types or object-extraction tools were used or needed yet (e.g., no need for extracting regions around clues).

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
The `fill_isolated_non7` function is broken and irrelevant: it incorrectly changes fixed clue numbers (non-0 non-7) to 7 based on >=3 adjacent 7s, but expected outputs preserve all clues unchanged. It also doesn't affect 0s and runs in a loop that may over-apply, leading to invalid changes (e.g., in train1 row12, it left some clues but expected filled areas to 7 without changing clues elsewhere). Do not use in future attempts.

```python
def fill_isolated_non7(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:  # Broken: changes clues, ignores 0s, not puzzle-relevant
    # ... (code as provided, but discard)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed due to incomplete flood fill (only top/left borders seeded, causing underfilling of 0s connected via bottom/right, e.g., train1 row6 left as [7,7,7,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,5,7,...] vs. expected all 7s; train3 row12-15 similar underfill of 0s).
 * Overfilling in non-enclosed areas: e.g., train2 row1 0s filled to 7s ([7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,...] generated vs. expected [7,7,7,3,7,7,0,0,0,7,...] with 0s preserved), suggesting border 0s aren't always exterior if part of interior structures.
 * Clue preservation failed indirectly: `fill_isolated_non7` didn't change most clues but was applied after flood, leaving mismatches where entire regions should be 7-filled without altering clues (e.g., train1 row7 generated [7,7,7,0,0,9,0,2,9,0,0,7,...] vs. expected [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,...], where 0s/clues stayed but should have been filled around/nearby).
 * Train1: Underfilled interior 0s (row6, row7 partial, row12 start [9,5,...] vs. expected 7s); overfilled nothing obvious but last two 0s correctly preserved in row7/8.
 * Train2: Severe overfilling of upper 0s (rows1-6 all mostly 7s generated vs. expected with 0-clusters and embedded clues like 1,5,2,6,9,8); lower 0s underfilled due to no right-border seed (row11-13 0s at end left vs. expected preserved as interior).
 * Train3: Underfilled lower 0s (rows12-15 [...,0,0,0,0,7,0,0] patterns vs. expected with some 7-fills but preserved 0-clusters around clues like 9,8,6,1,2); top overfilled slightly (row2 [7,7,8,3,...] but expected [7,7,8,3,...] similar, minor diff in row0 [7,7,7,3,...] vs. [7,6,7,3,...] unknown why 5->7? Wait, likely input diff but code filled adjacent 0s wrong).
 * No extraction of objects/regions (e.g., no function to identify clue-connected 0-clusters), missing for handling interior protections.
 * `fill_isolated_non7` caused no visible changes in most cases (clues had <3 adj 7s post-flood) but is conceptually wrong; remove it.
 * Overall, no handling for why some 0-clusters remain (e.g., enclosure by 7s/numbers) or clue implications (e.g., numbers protecting adjacent 0s from filling).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills some border-adjacent 0s (e.g., row5 [9,0,7,...] likely filled 0 to 7 incorrectly if that 0 is interior-protected like train2) and underfills lower/middle 0-clusters (e.g., rows7-15 have many unfilled 0s around clues like 2,4,1,9,5,6,8, but expected likely preserves some as interior while filling others to 7 based on connectivity/enclosure).
 * Specifically, row6 generated all 7s except scattered, but test input has 0s in row5 col10-15 [9,0,0,0,0,0], likely underfilled due to missing right-border seed (should connect via right if exterior).
 * Middle areas (rows7-9 cols3-15) have 0s preserved around clues (e.g., 2,4,0s), but if connected to bottom/right, they should be 7s per partial rules, yet code leaves them 0—mismatch similar to train1 underfill.
 * Lower rows (12-15) have 0s at ends (e.g., row12 col15=0, row13 col9=1 but adjacent 0s), looking like unfilled interiors, but without full borders seeded, it ignores potential exterior paths; also no clue changes, which is good, but overall too many 0s remain compared to expected patterns in training (e.g., train2 preserves 0-clusters but fills disconnected ones).
 * Does not account for protected 0s near borders (like train2 row1), leading to potential overfill in test's upper 0s (row5-6); unknown if test has enclosed regions with multiple clues (like train2 lower left), but code would fill them wrong without region extraction.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where 7 represents barriers or walls, non-7 cells (0-6,8,9) represent open spaces, air, or labeled objects, and the task is to identify connected components of these non-7 cells using 4-way adjacency, then fill (set to 7) only those components that are fully enclosed—specifically, those not touching the top row (row 0) or bottom row (row n-1)—effectively removing "trapped" or floating regions while preserving components connected to the top or bottom (possibly simulating exposure to air or ground).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connectivity is strictly 4-way (up, down, left, right) and only through non-7 cells; diagonal does not count.
 * Components are groups of adjacent non-7 cells; all non-7 values (including numbers 1-9 and 0s) are treated as connectable in the current approach, but this may be a subtlety—numbers 1-9 might represent solid "objects" that should block connectivity for air (0s only) or require special handling to preserve their positions and surrounding 0s if the object touches the bottom.
 * Filling only occurs for components not touching top or bottom rows; components touching either are preserved entirely (including their internal structure of 0s and numbers), which suggests a "grounded" or "exposed" rule where bottom-touching structures (e.g., cave formations or lakes) stay intact.
 * Subtle element: The puzzle likely preserves complex structures (e.g., "islands" or "pockets" with embedded numbers surrounded by 0s) if they touch the bottom, but the current flood fill merges separate structures incorrectly if they are connected through non-7 paths that shouldn't be (e.g., treating numbers as passable air).
 * Easy to miss: Not all enclosed areas are filled—only truly trapped ones; side-touching but bottom-touching components must be preserved, and the program may overfill by not distinguishing between air (0s) and objects (1-9). In expected outputs, preserved areas often have intricate patterns of 0s around numbers, suggesting objects define boundaries rather than being filled themselves.
 * Across attempts: No rotation, reflection, or value modification beyond filling to 7; grid size n=16 in examples; 7s are immutable barriers that block all connectivity and filling.
 * Potential misinterpretation: This isn't simple border flooding (e.g., from all sides); the top/bottom check implies vertical exposure (e.g., air from top, ground from bottom), not full perimeter. Numbers 1-9 are preserved in place in expected outputs, so filling shouldn't overwrite them unless the entire component is trapped.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program includes useful building blocks for component detection and filling, which align with core flood-fill logic.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def is_non_seven(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and g[x][y] != 7
```
(This bounds-checks and identifies traversable non-7 cells; helpful for any connectivity-based approach.)

```python
def touches_top_or_bottom(component: List[tuple], n: int) -> bool:
    for x, y in component:
        if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
            return True
    return False
```
(This correctly identifies exposure to top/bottom; essential for the enclosure rule, though may need extension to preserve side/bottom structures.)

```python
def flood_component(x: int, y: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[tuple]:
    component = []
    q = deque([(x, y)])
    visited[x][y] = True
    while q:
        cx, cy = q.popleft()
        component.append((cx, cy))
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            if is_non_seven(nx, ny, g, n) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny))
    return component
```
(This performs accurate 4-way BFS flood fill to extract components; very helpful and not broken—reuse it, but consider modifying is_non_seven to only traverse 0s if numbers are solid.)

The main program function integrates these well for iteration and filling but over-applies filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly solved training example 1 by properly identifying and filling enclosed non-7 components not touching top/bottom, preserving exposed ones.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated overfilled the grid, turning most middle and left-bottom areas to 7s (e.g., rows 1-10 mostly 7s except top-left 3s/5/6, and only a small bottom-right pocket with 0s/6/5/1/9 preserved), while expected preserves two separate structures—a middle-right pocket (rows 1-7, cols 6-15 with 0s/1/0/5/2/6/8/9) and a bottom-left pocket (rows 9-14, cols 1-8 with 0s/1/5/9/8/2/4)—likely because they touch bottom/sides but were incorrectly merged or deemed non-touching top/bottom.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated overfilled similarly, preserving only top-left (3s/6/8) and a tiny bottom-right strip (0s in col 14-15, rows 12-15), while expected preserves top-left plus a large middle-left structure (rows 5-14, cols 1-9 with 0s/5/2/1/9/6/8) and bottom-right 0s; difference is unknown but likely due to incorrect connectivity through numbers, filling bottom-touching components that should stay (e.g., expected keeps row 5-9 left with 0s/5/2/1).
 * Core issue across failures: Treats all non-7 (including 1-9) as connectable air, leading to over-merging and over-filling of preserved structures; expected outputs keep embedded numbers and surrounding 0s in bottom-touching "objects" intact, suggesting numbers may act as barriers for air fill or define preservable blobs.
 * touches_top_or_bottom is helpful but insufficient alone—may need to check bottom-only touching for preservation, or flood from bottom border to mark reachable areas instead of component-based filling.
 * No unhelpful functions here; all provided (is_non_seven, flood_component, touches_top_or_bottom) are relevant and functional, though is_non_seven may need tweaking to exclude 1-9 if they are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially resembles the incorrect training 2/3 patterns: It preserves top-left structure (rows 0-4, cols 0-5 with 2/5/4/3s and some 0s/6/1) and a large bottom-right/middle area (rows 5-15, cols 6-15 with scattered 0s/8/5/2/4/1/9), but fills middle areas with 7s (e.g., row 5 cols 0-5 has 9/0 then 7s).
 * It does not look correct, as it mirrors the overfilling seen in failed trainings (e.g., likely merged or incorrectly filled bottom-left/middle components that should be preserved like in training 2/3 expecteds, where multiple bottom-touching pockets with 0s around numbers remain); for instance, the test has isolated 9/0/8 in row 6-7 left, but if similar to trainings, this might be an overfilled "object" that should connect to a larger preserved structure touching bottom—unknown exact reason, but the sparse preservation suggests same connectivity error, leaving too few complex pockets.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
