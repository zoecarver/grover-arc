=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 00:22:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 00:33:56] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return g
    n = len(g)
    # Find background: most common value
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    background = Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
    # Copy the grid
    h = [row[:] for row in g]
    # Function to slide right in a row
    def slide_right_row(row, background, n):
        non_bg = [x for x in row if x != background]
        new_row = [background] * n
        for idx in range(len(non_bg)):
            new_row[n - len(non_bg) + idx] = non_bg[idx]
        return new_row
    # Slide right each row
    for i in range(n):
        h[i] = slide_right_row(h[i], background, n)
    # Function to bubble up in a column
    def bubble_up_column(col, background, n):
        non_bg = [x for x in col if x != background]
        new_col = [background] * n
        for idx in range(len(non_bg)):
            new_col[idx] = non_bg[idx]
        return new_col
    # Bubble up each column
    for j in range(n):
        col = [h[i][j] for i in range(n)]
        new_col = bubble_up_column(col, background, n)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 00:34:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where a background value (most common number) represents empty space, and non-background tiles appear to "fall" or move downward in columns while possibly preserving some horizontal structure or connections, resulting in stacked formations at the bottom of specific columns rather than uniform sliding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Non-background tiles move vertically downward (gravity-like) within their columns, stacking from the bottom up, but horizontal positions are not simply slid left/right—tiles seem to maintain or shift to form vertical stacks in columns where they originated or connected.
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent value, but movement is per-column downward, not row-wise sliding; the previous attempt reversed this by sliding right (horizontal) then up (opposite of gravity).
 * Tiles do not merge or combine values (e.g., no 2048-style addition); they retain their numbers and positions relative to each other in a way that suggests independent column processing after possible horizontal alignment.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but examples vary in size (e.g., 7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); ensure code handles variable n without assuming fixed size.
 * Subtle: In expected outputs, some tiles appear to "float" or shift horizontally slightly before falling (e.g., in training 1, the 4's align in column 4 before falling, and 8's stack in column 5); this may indicate pre-processing like left-alignment per row or object detection for connected groups.
 * Easy to miss: Not all non-background tiles fall uniformly—some examples show partial stacks (e.g., training 3 has a vertical line of 2's in column 6 across top rows, then branching to 7 and 9 in lower rows), suggesting possible rotation, connection-based movement, or multi-step processing (horizontal then vertical).
 * No overwriting or merging occurs; empty spaces fill with background only after movement.
 * Consider connected components: Tiles might form "objects" that fall as units, explaining why shapes are preserved (e.g., in training 4, the 8-3 pair shifts down while rotating or aligning).
 * Process columns independently for vertical movement, but rows may need initial left-packing or no horizontal move at all—previous right-slide disrupted this.
 * Edge case: If all tiles are background, return unchanged; if no non-background, no movement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""
    if not g:
        return 0  # Default if empty
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fall_down_column(col: List[int], background: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Move non-background tiles down in a column, stacking from bottom."""
    non_bg = [x for x in col if x != background]
    new_col = [background] * n
    # Stack from bottom: place non_bg in reverse order from bottom up
    for idx in range(len(non_bg)):
        new_col[n - 1 - idx] = non_bg[-1 - idx]  # Preserve original top-to-bottom order
    return new_col
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used row-wise right-sliding followed by column-wise up-bubbling, which clumped all non-background tiles to the top-right, inverting the expected downward gravity and disrupting horizontal structures.
 * Worked: Correctly identified background via Counter; copied grid to avoid mutation; separated row and column operations.
 * Didn't work: Horizontal right-slide pushed tiles right unnecessarily (expected shows left or no horizontal shift); upward bubbling opposed gravity (expected stacks at bottom); treated all non-bg independently without preserving order or connections, leading to jumbled stacks (e.g., in training 1, generated has 4's and 2 mixed at top-right, expected has aligned 4's falling to mid-bottom in col4, 2 in col5, 8's stacking bottom in col5).
 * In training 1: Generated clumped to rows 0-5 top-right (e.g., row0 ends [4,4,2]), expected has sparse downward stacks (e.g., row1 [...,4,2,0], row3 [...,4,8,0], bottom rows stacked 8's in col5)—difference in direction and no horizontal push.
 * In training 2: Generated slid everything right then up, filling top rows with 7's and clumping 3,4,2 to right columns (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,4]), expected shows diagonal-like fall with 4/3 shifting left-down (e.g., row0 [...,4,7,...], row3 [...,3,7,...], 2 stacking bottom-right in col7)—horizontal left-alignment missing, upward wrong.
 * In training 3: Generated messed up vertical lines (e.g., row0 ends [2,2,7,2], row2 [...,7,7,7]), expected preserves top vertical 2's in col6, then branches 7 right-down to col7, 9 further right-down to col9 with 7 wrap—suggests object tracing or path-following, not simple slide; attempt ignored connections.
 * In training 4: Generated right-up clump (e.g., row0 [...,8,8,3], row3 [...,8,5]), expected shows rotation/shift down-left (e.g., row0 [...,8,0,...], row1 [...,8,3,0,...], row2 [8,3,0,...], then 8-5 fall to col3-4 bottom)—attempt's slide lost the pair's relative positions.
 * In training 5: Generated right-up (e.g., row0 [...,9,9,9,3], row2 [...,9,6]), expected down-left stacks (e.g., row0 [...,9,0,...], row2 [...,9,3,0,...], 9-6 fall to col4-5 bottom)—similar loss of horizontal structure.
 * Function `slide_right_row` is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle (pushes right, but expected often left or none; don't use).
 * Function `bubble_up_column` is wrong direction (up instead of down; reverse to fall_down for future).
 * No object extraction attempted, but may be needed for connected groups—consider adding to trace shapes before falling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (22x22 grid?) clumps non-background tiles (3,8,9,4,6,1) via right-slide then up-bubble, resulting in top-heavy fillings (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,8,8,8,9,8], row8 [...,6], bottom rows all 5's/background)—this looks incorrect as it inverts gravity and mixes tiles horizontally/vertically without structure.
 * Does not match training expected patterns: Expected likely has downward stacks in specific columns (e.g., 3/8/9 falling to bottom in leftish cols, preserving any pairs like 4-3 or 9-6), but generated has top-right mess (e.g., 3's and 9's scattered top, 6/1 low but not stacked bottom)—missing left-align and down-fall.
 * Test has more tiles (3,8x4,9x3,4x2,6,1) scattered initially; output ignores potential connections (e.g., clustered 8's/9's should stack as group bottom, not bubble up).
 * Overall, test output does not make sense—it's a top-right pile-up, while puzzle seems bottom-left/downward formation; update to column-down fall after possible left-row pack to handle.

[2025-10-02 00:34:40] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 00:47:20] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    grid = [row[:] for row in g]
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    if not count:
        return grid
    bg = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
    positions = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != bg:
                positions.setdefault(c, []).append((i, j))
    # Clear old positions
    for c in positions:
        for i, j in positions[c]:
            grid[i][j] = bg
    # Place each color vertically in its average column, stacked from min row up
    for c in positions:
        ps = positions[c]
        if not ps:
            continue
        cols = [j for _, j in ps]
        avg_col = sum(cols) // len(cols)
        rows = [i for i, _ in ps]
        min_row = min(rows)
        k = len(ps)
        for idx in range(k):
            r = min_row + idx
            if 0 <= r < n and 0 <= avg_col < n:
                grid[r][avg_col] = c
    return grid

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 00:48:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where non-background colors (treated as "objects" or blobs) are rearranged into vertical stacks within the grid, likely simulating gravity or consolidation rules, while preserving the background (most common color, often 0 or 7 or 1 or 5) and avoiding overlaps. The goal appears to be grouping each color into a single vertical column based on some positional heuristic (e.g., average or median column of original positions), then stacking instances of that color contiguously from the bottom of the grid upward, but the exact ordering of colors and stacking direction/start point is critical and not fully captured.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is correctly identified as the most frequent value (e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test), and all non-background positions are cleared to it before repopulating.
 * Each non-background color is treated as independent "objects" or instances, collected by their original positions; the number of instances per color must be preserved exactly (e.g., four 4's, one 2, four 8's in ex1).
 * Column selection for stacking seems based on original positions of that color (e.g., average column works partially but fails when positions are spread out, as in ex1 where 4's avg to col2 but should be col4; perhaps use median column or leftmost/rightmost instead to better match expected clustering).
 * Stacking is vertical (same column for all instances of a color), but direction and starting point are wrong: current code stacks from the minimum original row upward (top-down), leading to mid-grid or top placements (e.g., 2 at row1 in ex1, 9's starting mid in ex3); expected often stacks from the bottom upward (gravity-like, filling from row n-1 down to cover exactly k rows where k=count of color).
 * Overlaps occur when multiple colors average to the same column (e.g., 4 and 8 both trying col5? in ex1 generated, but code overwrites sequentially); expected avoids this by assigning distinct columns or adjusting positions (e.g., ex1 uses col4 for 4's and col5 for 2/8, with 2 floating higher).
 * Subtle ordering: Colors may need to be processed in a specific sequence (e.g., by color value ascending/descending, or by original appearance order) to resolve column conflicts; in ex2, 4's and 3's interleave slightly before full stacking, suggesting partial horizontal preservation or blob connectivity.
 * Blobs/connectivity: If same-color adjacent cells form "blobs," they might need to be treated as single units (e.g., in ex4, 3's are stacked but shifted left; generated treats individually, leading to col2 for 3's but expected col3 with diagonal flavor); however, examples suggest individual cells, not strict blobs, but adjacency might influence column choice.
 * Grid size varies (7x7 in ex1/3, 12x12? in ex2, 10x10 in ex4, 9x9 in ex5, 22x22? in test with 22 elems/row), so n=len(g) is essential; ensure placements stay within bounds (0 <= r < n, 0 <= c < n).
 * Edge cases: Single-instance colors (e.g., 2 in ex1) don't stack but may "float" higher than full stacks (row1 vs bottom); empty colors or all-bg grids return unchanged.
 * No rotation, mirroring, or horizontal movement beyond column selection; output must match expected exactly, including 0/bg positions.
 * Potential miss: In ex3, 2's stack top-to-mid in col6, 7's shift right/down to col7 rows6-12 then col9-10, 9's at col9 rows9-11 with 7 below; suggests column assignment might prioritize original median col and stack from bottom, but with color ordering affecting overlaps (e.g., place lower colors first).
 * In ex5, diagonal-like preservation (9 and 3 interleave in cols 2-3) hints at not fully collapsing to single column per color—perhaps stack in original columns but drop down vertically per column independently (simple gravity per column), but that fails ex1 (would keep 4's scattered).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the most common color as background."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0  # or default
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
```python
def collect_positions_by_color(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> dict[int, list[tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Collects (row, col) positions for each non-background color."""
    n = len(g)
    positions = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != bg:
                positions.setdefault(c, []).append((i, j))
    return positions
```
```python
def compute_column_for_color(positions: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    """Computes a column for stacking; current avg, but consider median: sorted_cols = sorted(j for _, j in positions); return sorted_cols[len(sorted_cols)//2]"""
    if not positions:
        return 0
    cols = [j for _, j in positions]
    return sum(cols) // len(cols)  # Avg; alternative: min(cols) or max(cols) for edges
```
(Note: The clear_and_place logic in the original program is partially helpful but broken due to top-down stacking and no conflict resolution; avoid sequential overwriting without checks.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions/tools:**
 * The stacking loop in the original program (`for idx in range(k): r = min_row + idx; grid[r][avg_col] = c`) is broken: uses min_row (top-biased) instead of bottom-up (e.g., r = n - 1 - idx), causes overlaps without checking if cell is free, and doesn't handle color ordering.
 * Flat list creation is redundant if using row/col loops; Counter on flat is fine but not essential beyond bg.
 * No blob extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) was attempted, but it might be irrelevant since examples treat cells individually; don't pursue unless diagonals suggest otherwise (unproven).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg and collects per-color positions, which is a core step, but fails all training due to wrong stacking mechanics.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 2 at row1 col5 (partial match for position but wrong height), 4's at rows3-6 col2 (wrong col, overwrites potential space, should be col4 rows1-4 with offset), 8's at rows3-6 col5 (correct col but overwrites 2's space and starts too high; expected has 8's bottom 4 rows col5, 4's shifted left, 2 higher in col5).
 * Train 2: Generated repeats 4's top 3 rows col4 (close but no interleaving with 3's at col3), then 3's mid-bottom col4 (overwrites), 2's bottom col7 (partial col match); expected has 4's col4 top, 3's col3 rows1-2 then col4 bottom-up with gaps, 2's col7 bottom—mismatch in interleaving and full bottom-stacking.
 * Train 3: Generated 2's top-mid col6 (correct col but too many rows? wait, stacks 7 times but count=7?), 7's mid-bottom col10 (wrong col, should shift to col7 then col9), 9's bottom col9 (correct col but overlaps 7's); expected preserves top 2's stack, shifts 7's right/down in steps, 9's mid with 7 below—suggests non-overwrite placement order by row or color.
 * Train 4: Generated 3's rows1-3 col2 (wrong col and top-start), 8's rows4-8 col2 (overwrites 3's, wrong col), 5's rows4-8 col4 (partial col but overlaps); expected spreads 8/3 diagonally left in cols2-3 top-mid, then 5's bottom col4—mismatch indicates possible per-column gravity with horizontal shift for connections.
 * Train 5: Generated 3's rows2-3 col3 (correct col but mid, not top-diagonal), 9's row5 col1 (wrong col), 6's rows5-8 col5 (partial col); expected diagonals 9/3 in cols2-3 rows2-3, then 9 row4 col3, 6 bottom col5—suggests preserving relative horizontal positions while dropping vertically.
 * Overall: Avg column heuristic works for some (e.g., 8's col in ex1), but fails spread-out colors (4's in ex1); top-down stacking causes mid/top placements vs expected bottom-up; no overlap resolution leads to overwrites (e.g., multiple colors in col3 ex test); individual cell treatment ignores potential blob/diagonal preservation.
 * extract_objects equivalent (positions dict) is essential for grouping; without it, can't isolate colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows messy mid-grid stacking with overlaps and top-biased placements (e.g., 8's rows1-3 col3, 9's rows4-12 col11, 3's rows8-13 col3 overwriting 8's, 6 at row17 col7, 4/1 at row19-21 col4/8), leaving top/bottom mostly bg=5 but no clear vertical consolidation per color.
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., no bottom-up full stacks, colors like 8/3/9 crammed in few columns with overwrites, 4/1/6 not dropped fully); likely wrong because column avgs cluster too many (8/3 in col3), stacking starts high (e.g., 8's at row1 vs bottom), and no ordering to space out columns (e.g., 9 at col11 far right, but test input likely has spread positions).
 * To handle test, need bottom-up stacking (r = n - k + idx or n-1 - idx), median col instead of avg for outliers, place colors in sorted order (e.g., by min color value) with column adjustment if occupied, and check for per-column gravity alternative if diagonals persist.

[2025-10-02 00:48:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where a background value (most common number) represents empty space, and non-background tiles appear to "fall" or move downward in columns while possibly preserving some horizontal structure or connections, resulting in stacked formations at the bottom of specific columns rather than uniform sliding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Non-background tiles move vertically downward (gravity-like) within their columns, stacking from the bottom up, but horizontal positions are not simply slid left/right—tiles seem to maintain or shift to form vertical stacks in columns where they originated or connected.
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent value, but movement is per-column downward, not row-wise sliding; the previous attempt reversed this by sliding right (horizontal) then up (opposite of gravity).
 * Tiles do not merge or combine values (e.g., no 2048-style addition); they retain their numbers and positions relative to each other in a way that suggests independent column processing after possible horizontal alignment.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but examples vary in size (e.g., 7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); ensure code handles variable n without assuming fixed size.
 * Subtle: In expected outputs, some tiles appear to "float" or shift horizontally slightly before falling (e.g., in training 1, the 4's align in column 4 before falling, and 8's stack in column 5); this may indicate pre-processing like left-alignment per row or object detection for connected groups.
 * Easy to miss: Not all non-background tiles fall uniformly—some examples show partial stacks (e.g., training 3 has a vertical line of 2's in column 6 across top rows, then branching to 7 and 9 in lower rows), suggesting possible rotation, connection-based movement, or multi-step processing (horizontal then vertical).
 * No overwriting or merging occurs; empty spaces fill with background only after movement.
 * Consider connected components: Tiles might form "objects" that fall as units, explaining why shapes are preserved (e.g., in training 4, the 8-3 pair shifts down while rotating or aligning).
 * Process columns independently for vertical movement, but rows may need initial left-packing or no horizontal move at all—previous right-slide disrupted this.
 * Edge case: If all tiles are background, return unchanged; if no non-background, no movement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""
    if not g:
        return 0  # Default if empty
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fall_down_column(col: List[int], background: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Move non-background tiles down in a column, stacking from bottom."""
    non_bg = [x for x in col if x != background]
    new_col = [background] * n
    # Stack from bottom: place non_bg in reverse order from bottom up
    for idx in range(len(non_bg)):
        new_col[n - 1 - idx] = non_bg[-1 - idx]  # Preserve original top-to-bottom order
    return new_col
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used row-wise right-sliding followed by column-wise up-bubbling, which clumped all non-background tiles to the top-right, inverting the expected downward gravity and disrupting horizontal structures.
 * Worked: Correctly identified background via Counter; copied grid to avoid mutation; separated row and column operations.
 * Didn't work: Horizontal right-slide pushed tiles right unnecessarily (expected shows left or no horizontal shift); upward bubbling opposed gravity (expected stacks at bottom); treated all non-bg independently without preserving order or connections, leading to jumbled stacks (e.g., in training 1, generated has 4's and 2 mixed at top-right, expected has aligned 4's falling to mid-bottom in col4, 2 in col5, 8's stacking bottom in col5).
 * In training 1: Generated clumped to rows 0-5 top-right (e.g., row0 ends [4,4,2]), expected has sparse downward stacks (e.g., row1 [...,4,2,0], row3 [...,4,8,0], bottom rows stacked 8's in col5)—difference in direction and no horizontal push.
 * In training 2: Generated slid everything right then up, filling top rows with 7's and clumping 3,4,2 to right columns (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,4]), expected shows diagonal-like fall with 4/3 shifting left-down (e.g., row0 [...,4,7,...], row3 [...,3,7,...], 2 stacking bottom-right in col7)—horizontal left-alignment missing, upward wrong.
 * In training 3: Generated messed up vertical lines (e.g., row0 ends [2,2,7,2], row2 [...,7,7,7]), expected preserves top vertical 2's in col6, then branches 7 right-down to col7, 9 further right-down to col9 with 7 wrap—suggests object tracing or path-following, not simple slide; attempt ignored connections.
 * In training 4: Generated right-up clump (e.g., row0 [...,8,8,3], row3 [...,8,5]), expected shows rotation/shift down-left (e.g., row0 [...,8,0,...], row1 [...,8,3,0,...], row2 [8,3,0,...], then 8-5 fall to col3-4 bottom)—attempt's slide lost the pair's relative positions.
 * In training 5: Generated right-up (e.g., row0 [...,9,9,9,3], row2 [...,9,6]), expected down-left stacks (e.g., row0 [...,9,0,...], row2 [...,9,3,0,...], 9-6 fall to col4-5 bottom)—similar loss of horizontal structure.
 * Function `slide_right_row` is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle (pushes right, but expected often left or none; don't use).
 * Function `bubble_up_column` is wrong direction (up instead of down; reverse to fall_down for future).
 * No object extraction attempted, but may be needed for connected groups—consider adding to trace shapes before falling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (22x22 grid?) clumps non-background tiles (3,8,9,4,6,1) via right-slide then up-bubble, resulting in top-heavy fillings (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,8,8,8,9,8], row8 [...,6], bottom rows all 5's/background)—this looks incorrect as it inverts gravity and mixes tiles horizontally/vertically without structure.
 * Does not match training expected patterns: Expected likely has downward stacks in specific columns (e.g., 3/8/9 falling to bottom in leftish cols, preserving any pairs like 4-3 or 9-6), but generated has top-right mess (e.g., 3's and 9's scattered top, 6/1 low but not stacked bottom)—missing left-align and down-fall.
 * Test has more tiles (3,8x4,9x3,4x2,6,1) scattered initially; output ignores potential connections (e.g., clustered 8's/9's should stack as group bottom, not bubble up).
 * Overall, test output does not make sense—it's a top-right pile-up, while puzzle seems bottom-left/downward formation; update to column-down fall after possible left-row pack to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where non-background colors (treated as "objects" or blobs) are rearranged into vertical stacks within the grid, likely simulating gravity or consolidation rules, while preserving the background (most common color, often 0 or 7 or 1 or 5) and avoiding overlaps. The goal appears to be grouping each color into a single vertical column based on some positional heuristic (e.g., average or median column of original positions), then stacking instances of that color contiguously from the bottom of the grid upward, but the exact ordering of colors and stacking direction/start point is critical and not fully captured.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is correctly identified as the most frequent value (e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test), and all non-background positions are cleared to it before repopulating.
 * Each non-background color is treated as independent "objects" or instances, collected by their original positions; the number of instances per color must be preserved exactly (e.g., four 4's, one 2, four 8's in ex1).
 * Column selection for stacking seems based on original positions of that color (e.g., average column works partially but fails when positions are spread out, as in ex1 where 4's avg to col2 but should be col4; perhaps use median column or leftmost/rightmost instead to better match expected clustering).
 * Stacking is vertical (same column for all instances of a color), but direction and starting point are wrong: current code stacks from the minimum original row upward (top-down), leading to mid-grid or top placements (e.g., 2 at row1 in ex1, 9's starting mid in ex3); expected often stacks from the bottom upward (gravity-like, filling from row n-1 down to cover exactly k rows where k=count of color).
 * Overlaps occur when multiple colors average to the same column (e.g., 4 and 8 both trying col5? in ex1 generated, but code overwrites sequentially); expected avoids this by assigning distinct columns or adjusting positions (e.g., ex1 uses col4 for 4's and col5 for 2/8, with 2 floating higher).
 * Subtle ordering: Colors may need to be processed in a specific sequence (e.g., by color value ascending/descending, or by original appearance order) to resolve column conflicts; in ex2, 4's and 3's interleave slightly before full stacking, suggesting partial horizontal preservation or blob connectivity.
 * Blobs/connectivity: If same-color adjacent cells form "blobs," they might need to be treated as single units (e.g., in ex4, 3's are stacked but shifted left; generated treats individually, leading to col2 for 3's but expected col3 with diagonal flavor); however, examples suggest individual cells, not strict blobs, but adjacency might influence column choice.
 * Grid size varies (7x7 in ex1/3, 12x12? in ex2, 10x10 in ex4, 9x9 in ex5, 22x22? in test with 22 elems/row), so n=len(g) is essential; ensure placements stay within bounds (0 <= r < n, 0 <= c < n).
 * Edge cases: Single-instance colors (e.g., 2 in ex1) don't stack but may "float" higher than full stacks (row1 vs bottom); empty colors or all-bg grids return unchanged.
 * No rotation, mirroring, or horizontal movement beyond column selection; output must match expected exactly, including 0/bg positions.
 * Potential miss: In ex3, 2's stack top-to-mid in col6, 7's shift right/down to col7 rows6-12 then col9-10, 9's at col9 rows9-11 with 7 below; suggests column assignment might prioritize original median col and stack from bottom, but with color ordering affecting overlaps (e.g., place lower colors first).
 * In ex5, diagonal-like preservation (9 and 3 interleave in cols 2-3) hints at not fully collapsing to single column per color—perhaps stack in original columns but drop down vertically per column independently (simple gravity per column), but that fails ex1 (would keep 4's scattered).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the most common color as background."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0  # or default
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
```python
def collect_positions_by_color(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> dict[int, list[tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Collects (row, col) positions for each non-background color."""
    n = len(g)
    positions = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != bg:
                positions.setdefault(c, []).append((i, j))
    return positions
```
```python
def compute_column_for_color(positions: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    """Computes a column for stacking; current avg, but consider median: sorted_cols = sorted(j for _, j in positions); return sorted_cols[len(sorted_cols)//2]"""
    if not positions:
        return 0
    cols = [j for _, j in positions]
    return sum(cols) // len(cols)  # Avg; alternative: min(cols) or max(cols) for edges
```
(Note: The clear_and_place logic in the original program is partially helpful but broken due to top-down stacking and no conflict resolution; avoid sequential overwriting without checks.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions/tools:**
 * The stacking loop in the original program (`for idx in range(k): r = min_row + idx; grid[r][avg_col] = c`) is broken: uses min_row (top-biased) instead of bottom-up (e.g., r = n - 1 - idx), causes overlaps without checking if cell is free, and doesn't handle color ordering.
 * Flat list creation is redundant if using row/col loops; Counter on flat is fine but not essential beyond bg.
 * No blob extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) was attempted, but it might be irrelevant since examples treat cells individually; don't pursue unless diagonals suggest otherwise (unproven).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg and collects per-color positions, which is a core step, but fails all training due to wrong stacking mechanics.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 2 at row1 col5 (partial match for position but wrong height), 4's at rows3-6 col2 (wrong col, overwrites potential space, should be col4 rows1-4 with offset), 8's at rows3-6 col5 (correct col but overwrites 2's space and starts too high; expected has 8's bottom 4 rows col5, 4's shifted left, 2 higher in col5).
 * Train 2: Generated repeats 4's top 3 rows col4 (close but no interleaving with 3's at col3), then 3's mid-bottom col4 (overwrites), 2's bottom col7 (partial col match); expected has 4's col4 top, 3's col3 rows1-2 then col4 bottom-up with gaps, 2's col7 bottom—mismatch in interleaving and full bottom-stacking.
 * Train 3: Generated 2's top-mid col6 (correct col but too many rows? wait, stacks 7 times but count=7?), 7's mid-bottom col10 (wrong col, should shift to col7 then col9), 9's bottom col9 (correct col but overlaps 7's); expected preserves top 2's stack, shifts 7's right/down in steps, 9's mid with 7 below—suggests non-overwrite placement order by row or color.
 * Train 4: Generated 3's rows1-3 col2 (wrong col and top-start), 8's rows4-8 col2 (overwrites 3's, wrong col), 5's rows4-8 col4 (partial col but overlaps); expected spreads 8/3 diagonally left in cols2-3 top-mid, then 5's bottom col4—mismatch indicates possible per-column gravity with horizontal shift for connections.
 * Train 5: Generated 3's rows2-3 col3 (correct col but mid, not top-diagonal), 9's row5 col1 (wrong col), 6's rows5-8 col5 (partial col); expected diagonals 9/3 in cols2-3 rows2-3, then 9 row4 col3, 6 bottom col5—suggests preserving relative horizontal positions while dropping vertically.
 * Overall: Avg column heuristic works for some (e.g., 8's col in ex1), but fails spread-out colors (4's in ex1); top-down stacking causes mid/top placements vs expected bottom-up; no overlap resolution leads to overwrites (e.g., multiple colors in col3 ex test); individual cell treatment ignores potential blob/diagonal preservation.
 * extract_objects equivalent (positions dict) is essential for grouping; without it, can't isolate colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows messy mid-grid stacking with overlaps and top-biased placements (e.g., 8's rows1-3 col3, 9's rows4-12 col11, 3's rows8-13 col3 overwriting 8's, 6 at row17 col7, 4/1 at row19-21 col4/8), leaving top/bottom mostly bg=5 but no clear vertical consolidation per color.
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., no bottom-up full stacks, colors like 8/3/9 crammed in few columns with overwrites, 4/1/6 not dropped fully); likely wrong because column avgs cluster too many (8/3 in col3), stacking starts high (e.g., 8's at row1 vs bottom), and no ordering to space out columns (e.g., 9 at col11 far right, but test input likely has spread positions).
 * To handle test, need bottom-up stacking (r = n - k + idx or n-1 - idx), median col instead of avg for outliers, place colors in sorted order (e.g., by min color value) with column adjustment if occupied, and check for per-column gravity alternative if diagonals persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 00:56:38] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

def fall_down_column(col: List[int], background: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    non_bg = [x for x in col if x != background]
    new_col = [background] * n
    for idx in range(len(non_bg)):
        new_col[n - 1 - idx] = non_bg[-1 - idx]
    return new_col

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return g
    bg = find_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    for j in range(n):
        col = [new_g[i][j] for i in range(n)]
        new_col = fall_down_column(col, bg, n)
        for i in range(n):
            new_g[i][j] = new_col[i]
    return new_g

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 00:57:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle simulating gravity on a grid where non-background cells (numbers) fall downward, but connected groups (blobs or "objects") of the same number must fall as rigid, intact units rather than scattering per cell or per column. The goal is to apply gravity such that these connected components drop as wholes until they stack on the bottom, other components, or the grid floor, while preserving their relative shapes and positions within the component.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent number (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 7 across examples), and only non-background cells move; background fills vacated spaces.
 * Connectivity is key: Use 4-connected (up/down/left/right, not diagonal) or possibly 8-connected groups of identical numbers as "objects" that fall rigidly together—do not break them into individual cells or columns.
 * Falling order matters: Components likely need to be processed from lowest to highest (bottom-up simulation) to avoid overlaps or premature stacking; simulate step-by-step drops (one row at a time per component) until no more movement is possible.
 * Stacking rules: When a component falls, it drops until any of its cells hits the bottom row, another stable component below, or background— the entire shape shifts down uniformly.
 * Subtleties: Components can interlock or stack in non-column-aligned ways (e.g., overhanging shapes); horizontal connections across columns must be preserved (e.g., rows of 4's fall as a bar, not splitting). No rotation or deformation—rigid drop only. Handle empty grids or all-background as no-op. Potential for multiple components of the same number to fall separately if not connected. Diagonal connections probably don't count (based on examples where shapes don't merge diagonally). In complex cases (e.g., train3), nested or L-shaped blobs form and fall without filling gaps internally.
 * Edge cases: Grids of varying sizes (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); components touching the bottom don't move; if components would overlap after falling, resolve by order (e.g., lower ones first).
 * All training examples failed because per-column falling ignores connectivity, causing shapes to distort (e.g., horizontal bars become vertical stacks).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `find_background` function is helpful and correct for identifying the background color via frequency count.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The provided `fall_down_column` function is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—it applies gravity per column independently, which splits connected components (do not reuse or adapt directly; it ignores horizontal/vertical bonds).

To solve, need new functions for connected components (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) and rigid falling simulation:

```python

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                value = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()

                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == value:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((component, value))
    return components
```

```python
def drop_component(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], value: int, background: int, rows: int) -> Tuple[List[List[int]], int]:
    """

    # Find min row in component (relative bottom)
    min_row = min(pos[0] for pos in component)
    drop_rows = 0
    while True:
        # Check if can drop one more row
        can_drop = True
        new_positions = [(r + 1, c) for r, c in component]
        for r, c in new_positions:
            if r + 1 >= rows or g[r + 1][c] != background:
                can_drop = False
                break

            g[r][c] = value
        component = new_positions  # Update for next check
    return g, drop_rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used per-column gravity, which worked for identifying background correctly (e.g., 0 in train1/4/5, 7 in train2, 1 in train3) and basic downward stacking in isolated columns, but failed entirely on preserving connected shapes—components split and reformed vertically, distorting blobs (e.g., horizontal groups of 4's or 8's became scattered vertical stacks).
 * Train1: Generated stacked 4's and 8's at bottom of cols independently, but expected shows a connected "L" or bar of 4's falling as a unit to mid-right, with 2 and 8 stacking adjacently without splitting; difference: generated has 4's duplicated/stacked wrong in col3/6, 2 misplaced high.
 * Train2: Generated per-column drop turned horizontal 3's/4's into verticals at bottom, with 2 isolated; expected keeps some horizontal structure and stacks 3's/4's as partial bars in cols3-5, with 2 at bottom col7—difference: generated has 3's only in bottom row col3, 4's split vertically in col4, ignoring connections.
 * Train3: Generated crammed everything to bottom rows with vertical stacks (e.g., 7's and 9's aligned in cols), but expected spreads shapes horizontally (e.g., 7's form an L-shape across rows7-16 in varying cols, 9's horizontal in cols9-10); difference: generated ignores blob shapes entirely, filling bottom uniformly; 2's stacked vertically in col6.
 * Train4: Generated vertical stacks of 3's/8's in cols2-4, 5's isolated in col4; expected rotates/stacks as connected: 8's and 3's form a snake-like drop across cols1-3, 5's vertical in col4—difference: generated has 8's horizontal at bottom row9 but 3's split, no overhanging.
 * Train5: Generated 9's horizontal at bottom row8, 3's vertical in col3, 6's vertical in col5; expected drops 9's as a connected blob wrapping around 3's and 6's (horizontal in row0 col4, vertical in col2 rows2-4, etc.)—difference: generated keeps 9's flat but positions 3 and 6 wrong, no wrapping connectivity.
 * `fall_down_column` is broken/not helpful—it's column-centric and doesn't handle cross-column connections (avoid in future; replace with component-based dropping).
 * No extraction of objects in attempt, which is essential for identifying rigid blobs—future attempts must include connected component detection to group cells properly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it applies the same flawed per-column gravity, resulting in mostly uniform 5's (background?) filling the grid, with mismatched blobs crammed to the bottom rows (e.g., 8's/3's/4's/9's stacked vertically in cols2-13 row20-21, 1/6 isolated). This ignores connectivity, turning what should be rigid shapes (e.g., horizontal 8's in row19, clustered 3's/4's in row20, 9's in row20) into disconnected vertical piles, similar to training failures. It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected output should preserve blob shapes (e.g., horizontal bars of 4's or 9's dropping as units, possibly interlocking with 8's or 3's without splitting). Without the exact expected test output, it's unclear on precise stacking, but the uniform bottom-filling and shape distortion confirm it's wrong—likely needs component extraction to handle the clustered non-5's (1,3,4,6,8,9) as falling objects.

[2025-10-02 00:57:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where a background value (most common number) represents empty space, and non-background tiles appear to "fall" or move downward in columns while possibly preserving some horizontal structure or connections, resulting in stacked formations at the bottom of specific columns rather than uniform sliding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Non-background tiles move vertically downward (gravity-like) within their columns, stacking from the bottom up, but horizontal positions are not simply slid left/right—tiles seem to maintain or shift to form vertical stacks in columns where they originated or connected.
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent value, but movement is per-column downward, not row-wise sliding; the previous attempt reversed this by sliding right (horizontal) then up (opposite of gravity).
 * Tiles do not merge or combine values (e.g., no 2048-style addition); they retain their numbers and positions relative to each other in a way that suggests independent column processing after possible horizontal alignment.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but examples vary in size (e.g., 7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); ensure code handles variable n without assuming fixed size.
 * Subtle: In expected outputs, some tiles appear to "float" or shift horizontally slightly before falling (e.g., in training 1, the 4's align in column 4 before falling, and 8's stack in column 5); this may indicate pre-processing like left-alignment per row or object detection for connected groups.
 * Easy to miss: Not all non-background tiles fall uniformly—some examples show partial stacks (e.g., training 3 has a vertical line of 2's in column 6 across top rows, then branching to 7 and 9 in lower rows), suggesting possible rotation, connection-based movement, or multi-step processing (horizontal then vertical).
 * No overwriting or merging occurs; empty spaces fill with background only after movement.
 * Consider connected components: Tiles might form "objects" that fall as units, explaining why shapes are preserved (e.g., in training 4, the 8-3 pair shifts down while rotating or aligning).
 * Process columns independently for vertical movement, but rows may need initial left-packing or no horizontal move at all—previous right-slide disrupted this.
 * Edge case: If all tiles are background, return unchanged; if no non-background, no movement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""
    if not g:
        return 0  # Default if empty
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fall_down_column(col: List[int], background: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Move non-background tiles down in a column, stacking from bottom."""
    non_bg = [x for x in col if x != background]
    new_col = [background] * n
    # Stack from bottom: place non_bg in reverse order from bottom up
    for idx in range(len(non_bg)):
        new_col[n - 1 - idx] = non_bg[-1 - idx]  # Preserve original top-to-bottom order
    return new_col
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used row-wise right-sliding followed by column-wise up-bubbling, which clumped all non-background tiles to the top-right, inverting the expected downward gravity and disrupting horizontal structures.
 * Worked: Correctly identified background via Counter; copied grid to avoid mutation; separated row and column operations.
 * Didn't work: Horizontal right-slide pushed tiles right unnecessarily (expected shows left or no horizontal shift); upward bubbling opposed gravity (expected stacks at bottom); treated all non-bg independently without preserving order or connections, leading to jumbled stacks (e.g., in training 1, generated has 4's and 2 mixed at top-right, expected has aligned 4's falling to mid-bottom in col4, 2 in col5, 8's stacking bottom in col5).
 * In training 1: Generated clumped to rows 0-5 top-right (e.g., row0 ends [4,4,2]), expected has sparse downward stacks (e.g., row1 [...,4,2,0], row3 [...,4,8,0], bottom rows stacked 8's in col5)—difference in direction and no horizontal push.
 * In training 2: Generated slid everything right then up, filling top rows with 7's and clumping 3,4,2 to right columns (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,4]), expected shows diagonal-like fall with 4/3 shifting left-down (e.g., row0 [...,4,7,...], row3 [...,3,7,...], 2 stacking bottom-right in col7)—horizontal left-alignment missing, upward wrong.
 * In training 3: Generated messed up vertical lines (e.g., row0 ends [2,2,7,2], row2 [...,7,7,7]), expected preserves top vertical 2's in col6, then branches 7 right-down to col7, 9 further right-down to col9 with 7 wrap—suggests object tracing or path-following, not simple slide; attempt ignored connections.
 * In training 4: Generated right-up clump (e.g., row0 [...,8,8,3], row3 [...,8,5]), expected shows rotation/shift down-left (e.g., row0 [...,8,0,...], row1 [...,8,3,0,...], row2 [8,3,0,...], then 8-5 fall to col3-4 bottom)—attempt's slide lost the pair's relative positions.
 * In training 5: Generated right-up (e.g., row0 [...,9,9,9,3], row2 [...,9,6]), expected down-left stacks (e.g., row0 [...,9,0,...], row2 [...,9,3,0,...], 9-6 fall to col4-5 bottom)—similar loss of horizontal structure.
 * Function `slide_right_row` is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle (pushes right, but expected often left or none; don't use).
 * Function `bubble_up_column` is wrong direction (up instead of down; reverse to fall_down for future).
 * No object extraction attempted, but may be needed for connected groups—consider adding to trace shapes before falling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (22x22 grid?) clumps non-background tiles (3,8,9,4,6,1) via right-slide then up-bubble, resulting in top-heavy fillings (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,8,8,8,9,8], row8 [...,6], bottom rows all 5's/background)—this looks incorrect as it inverts gravity and mixes tiles horizontally/vertically without structure.
 * Does not match training expected patterns: Expected likely has downward stacks in specific columns (e.g., 3/8/9 falling to bottom in leftish cols, preserving any pairs like 4-3 or 9-6), but generated has top-right mess (e.g., 3's and 9's scattered top, 6/1 low but not stacked bottom)—missing left-align and down-fall.
 * Test has more tiles (3,8x4,9x3,4x2,6,1) scattered initially; output ignores potential connections (e.g., clustered 8's/9's should stack as group bottom, not bubble up).
 * Overall, test output does not make sense—it's a top-right pile-up, while puzzle seems bottom-left/downward formation; update to column-down fall after possible left-row pack to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle simulating gravity on a grid where non-background cells (numbers) fall downward, but connected groups (blobs or "objects") of the same number must fall as rigid, intact units rather than scattering per cell or per column. The goal is to apply gravity such that these connected components drop as wholes until they stack on the bottom, other components, or the grid floor, while preserving their relative shapes and positions within the component.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent number (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 7 across examples), and only non-background cells move; background fills vacated spaces.
 * Connectivity is key: Use 4-connected (up/down/left/right, not diagonal) or possibly 8-connected groups of identical numbers as "objects" that fall rigidly together—do not break them into individual cells or columns.
 * Falling order matters: Components likely need to be processed from lowest to highest (bottom-up simulation) to avoid overlaps or premature stacking; simulate step-by-step drops (one row at a time per component) until no more movement is possible.
 * Stacking rules: When a component falls, it drops until any of its cells hits the bottom row, another stable component below, or background— the entire shape shifts down uniformly.
 * Subtleties: Components can interlock or stack in non-column-aligned ways (e.g., overhanging shapes); horizontal connections across columns must be preserved (e.g., rows of 4's fall as a bar, not splitting). No rotation or deformation—rigid drop only. Handle empty grids or all-background as no-op. Potential for multiple components of the same number to fall separately if not connected. Diagonal connections probably don't count (based on examples where shapes don't merge diagonally). In complex cases (e.g., train3), nested or L-shaped blobs form and fall without filling gaps internally.
 * Edge cases: Grids of varying sizes (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); components touching the bottom don't move; if components would overlap after falling, resolve by order (e.g., lower ones first).
 * All training examples failed because per-column falling ignores connectivity, causing shapes to distort (e.g., horizontal bars become vertical stacks).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `find_background` function is helpful and correct for identifying the background color via frequency count.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The provided `fall_down_column` function is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—it applies gravity per column independently, which splits connected components (do not reuse or adapt directly; it ignores horizontal/vertical bonds).

To solve, need new functions for connected components (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) and rigid falling simulation:

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """
    Returns list of (positions_list, value) for each 4-connected component of same non-bg value.
    Uses flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to identify rigid objects.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used per-column gravity, which worked for identifying background correctly (e.g., 0 in train1/4/5, 7 in train2, 1 in train3) and basic downward stacking in isolated columns, but failed entirely on preserving connected shapes—components split and reformed vertically, distorting blobs (e.g., horizontal groups of 4's or 8's became scattered vertical stacks).
 * Train1: Generated stacked 4's and 8's at bottom of cols independently, but expected shows a connected "L" or bar of 4's falling as a unit to mid-right, with 2 and 8 stacking adjacently without splitting; difference: generated has 4's duplicated/stacked wrong in col3/6, 2 misplaced high.
 * Train2: Generated per-column drop turned horizontal 3's/4's into verticals at bottom, with 2 isolated; expected keeps some horizontal structure and stacks 3's/4's as partial bars in cols3-5, with 2 at bottom col7—difference: generated has 3's only in bottom row col3, 4's split vertically in col4, ignoring connections.
 * Train3: Generated crammed everything to bottom rows with vertical stacks (e.g., 7's and 9's aligned in cols), but expected spreads shapes horizontally (e.g., 7's form an L-shape across rows7-16 in varying cols, 9's horizontal in cols9-10); difference: generated ignores blob shapes entirely, filling bottom uniformly; 2's stacked vertically in col6.
 * Train4: Generated vertical stacks of 3's/8's in cols2-4, 5's isolated in col4; expected rotates/stacks as connected: 8's and 3's form a snake-like drop across cols1-3, 5's vertical in col4—difference: generated has 8's horizontal at bottom row9 but 3's split, no overhanging.
 * Train5: Generated 9's horizontal at bottom row8, 3's vertical in col3, 6's vertical in col5; expected drops 9's as a connected blob wrapping around 3's and 6's (horizontal in row0 col4, vertical in col2 rows2-4, etc.)—difference: generated keeps 9's flat but positions 3 and 6 wrong, no wrapping connectivity.
 * `fall_down_column` is broken/not helpful—it's column-centric and doesn't handle cross-column connections (avoid in future; replace with component-based dropping).
 * No extraction of objects in attempt, which is essential for identifying rigid blobs—future attempts must include connected component detection to group cells properly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it applies the same flawed per-column gravity, resulting in mostly uniform 5's (background?) filling the grid, with mismatched blobs crammed to the bottom rows (e.g., 8's/3's/4's/9's stacked vertically in cols2-13 row20-21, 1/6 isolated). This ignores connectivity, turning what should be rigid shapes (e.g., horizontal 8's in row19, clustered 3's/4's in row20, 9's in row20) into disconnected vertical piles, similar to training failures. It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected output should preserve blob shapes (e.g., horizontal bars of 4's or 9's dropping as units, possibly interlocking with 8's or 3's without splitting). Without the exact expected test output, it's unclear on precise stacking, but the uniform bottom-filling and shape distortion confirm it's wrong—likely needs component extraction to handle the clustered non-5's (1,3,4,6,8,9) as falling objects.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where non-background colors (treated as "objects" or blobs) are rearranged into vertical stacks within the grid, likely simulating gravity or consolidation rules, while preserving the background (most common color, often 0 or 7 or 1 or 5) and avoiding overlaps. The goal appears to be grouping each color into a single vertical column based on some positional heuristic (e.g., average or median column of original positions), then stacking instances of that color contiguously from the bottom of the grid upward, but the exact ordering of colors and stacking direction/start point is critical and not fully captured.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is correctly identified as the most frequent value (e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test), and all non-background positions are cleared to it before repopulating.
 * Each non-background color is treated as independent "objects" or instances, collected by their original positions; the number of instances per color must be preserved exactly (e.g., four 4's, one 2, four 8's in ex1).
 * Column selection for stacking seems based on original positions of that color (e.g., average column works partially but fails when positions are spread out, as in ex1 where 4's avg to col2 but should be col4; perhaps use median column or leftmost/rightmost instead to better match expected clustering).
 * Stacking is vertical (same column for all instances of a color), but direction and starting point are wrong: current code stacks from the minimum original row upward (top-down), leading to mid-grid or top placements (e.g., 2 at row1 in ex1, 9's starting mid in ex3); expected often stacks from the bottom upward (gravity-like, filling from row n-1 down to cover exactly k rows where k=count of color).
 * Overlaps occur when multiple colors average to the same column (e.g., 4 and 8 both trying col5? in ex1 generated, but code overwrites sequentially); expected avoids this by assigning distinct columns or adjusting positions (e.g., ex1 uses col4 for 4's and col5 for 2/8, with 2 floating higher).
 * Subtle ordering: Colors may need to be processed in a specific sequence (e.g., by color value ascending/descending, or by original appearance order) to resolve column conflicts; in ex2, 4's and 3's interleave slightly before full stacking, suggesting partial horizontal preservation or blob connectivity.
 * Blobs/connectivity: If same-color adjacent cells form "blobs," they might need to be treated as single units (e.g., in ex4, 3's are stacked but shifted left; generated treats individually, leading to col2 for 3's but expected col3 with diagonal flavor); however, examples suggest individual cells, not strict blobs, but adjacency might influence column choice.
 * Grid size varies (7x7 in ex1/3, 12x12? in ex2, 10x10 in ex4, 9x9 in ex5, 22x22? in test with 22 elems/row), so n=len(g) is essential; ensure placements stay within bounds (0 <= r < n, 0 <= c < n).
 * Edge cases: Single-instance colors (e.g., 2 in ex1) don't stack but may "float" higher than full stacks (row1 vs bottom); empty colors or all-bg grids return unchanged.
 * No rotation, mirroring, or horizontal movement beyond column selection; output must match expected exactly, including 0/bg positions.
 * Potential miss: In ex3, 2's stack top-to-mid in col6, 7's shift right/down to col7 rows6-12 then col9-10, 9's at col9 rows9-11 with 7 below; suggests column assignment might prioritize original median col and stack from bottom, but with color ordering affecting overlaps (e.g., place lower colors first).
 * In ex5, diagonal-like preservation (9 and 3 interleave in cols 2-3) hints at not fully collapsing to single column per color—perhaps stack in original columns but drop down vertically per column independently (simple gravity per column), but that fails ex1 (would keep 4's scattered).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the most common color as background."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0  # or default
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
```python
def collect_positions_by_color(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> dict[int, list[tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Collects (row, col) positions for each non-background color."""
    n = len(g)
    positions = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != bg:
                positions.setdefault(c, []).append((i, j))
    return positions
```
```python
def compute_column_for_color(positions: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    """Computes a column for stacking; current avg, but consider median: sorted_cols = sorted(j for _, j in positions); return sorted_cols[len(sorted_cols)//2]"""
    if not positions:
        return 0
    cols = [j for _, j in positions]
    return sum(cols) // len(cols)  # Avg; alternative: min(cols) or max(cols) for edges
```
(Note: The clear_and_place logic in the original program is partially helpful but broken due to top-down stacking and no conflict resolution; avoid sequential overwriting without checks.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions/tools:**
 * The stacking loop in the original program (`for idx in range(k): r = min_row + idx; grid[r][avg_col] = c`) is broken: uses min_row (top-biased) instead of bottom-up (e.g., r = n - 1 - idx), causes overlaps without checking if cell is free, and doesn't handle color ordering.
 * Flat list creation is redundant if using row/col loops; Counter on flat is fine but not essential beyond bg.
 * No blob extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) was attempted, but it might be irrelevant since examples treat cells individually; don't pursue unless diagonals suggest otherwise (unproven).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg and collects per-color positions, which is a core step, but fails all training due to wrong stacking mechanics.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 2 at row1 col5 (partial match for position but wrong height), 4's at rows3-6 col2 (wrong col, overwrites potential space, should be col4 rows1-4 with offset), 8's at rows3-6 col5 (correct col but overwrites 2's space and starts too high; expected has 8's bottom 4 rows col5, 4's shifted left, 2 higher in col5).
 * Train 2: Generated repeats 4's top 3 rows col4 (close but no interleaving with 3's at col3), then 3's mid-bottom col4 (overwrites), 2's bottom col7 (partial col match); expected has 4's col4 top, 3's col3 rows1-2 then col4 bottom-up with gaps, 2's col7 bottom—mismatch in interleaving and full bottom-stacking.
 * Train 3: Generated 2's top-mid col6 (correct col but too many rows? wait, stacks 7 times but count=7?), 7's mid-bottom col10 (wrong col, should shift to col7 then col9), 9's bottom col9 (correct col but overlaps 7's); expected preserves top 2's stack, shifts 7's right/down in steps, 9's mid with 7 below—suggests non-overwrite placement order by row or color.
 * Train 4: Generated 3's rows1-3 col2 (wrong col and top-start), 8's rows4-8 col2 (overwrites 3's, wrong col), 5's rows4-8 col4 (partial col but overlaps); expected spreads 8/3 diagonally left in cols2-3 top-mid, then 5's bottom col4—mismatch indicates possible per-column gravity with horizontal shift for connections.
 * Train 5: Generated 3's rows2-3 col3 (correct col but mid, not top-diagonal), 9's row5 col1 (wrong col), 6's rows5-8 col5 (partial col); expected diagonals 9/3 in cols2-3 rows2-3, then 9 row4 col3, 6 bottom col5—suggests preserving relative horizontal positions while dropping vertically.
 * Overall: Avg column heuristic works for some (e.g., 8's col in ex1), but fails spread-out colors (4's in ex1); top-down stacking causes mid/top placements vs expected bottom-up; no overlap resolution leads to overwrites (e.g., multiple colors in col3 ex test); individual cell treatment ignores potential blob/diagonal preservation.
 * extract_objects equivalent (positions dict) is essential for grouping; without it, can't isolate colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows messy mid-grid stacking with overlaps and top-biased placements (e.g., 8's rows1-3 col3, 9's rows4-12 col11, 3's rows8-13 col3 overwriting 8's, 6 at row17 col7, 4/1 at row19-21 col4/8), leaving top/bottom mostly bg=5 but no clear vertical consolidation per color.
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., no bottom-up full stacks, colors like 8/3/9 crammed in few columns with overwrites, 4/1/6 not dropped fully); likely wrong because column avgs cluster too many (8/3 in col3), stacking starts high (e.g., 8's at row1 vs bottom), and no ordering to space out columns (e.g., 9 at col11 far right, but test input likely has spread positions).
 * To handle test, need bottom-up stacking (r = n - k + idx or n-1 - idx), median col instead of avg for outliers, place colors in sorted order (e.g., by min color value) with column adjustment if occupied, and check for per-column gravity alternative if diagonals persist.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 01:12:11] Response:
**High level:** This is a puzzle simulating gravity in a 2D grid where non-background cells of the same value form connected components that fall downward (increasing row index, assuming row 0 is top), stacking on the bottom or other components, similar to match-3 games like Candy Crush or Puyo Puyo, but with evidence of a removal step for matched groups (3+ connected same value) after falling, as cell counts decrease in some examples (e.g., example 1: 6 to 4 for value 4; example 4: 6 to 5 for value 8).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are groups of same-value non-background cells; the attempt uses 4-connected (up/down/left/right), but examples suggest 8-connected (including diagonals) may be needed for proper grouping and potential matching, as seen in expected diagonal chains (e.g., example 2 3's form a diagonal line).
 * Gravity is downward (vertical drop only in the attempt, but examples show possible sideways shifting or sliding when blocked, e.g., example 1 4's shift right to col4-5; example 4 8's/3's shift left to col1-3).
 * Processing order is critical: sort by lowest point (max row) descending to drop bottom components first, avoiding interference; the attempt does this correctly, but fails because rigid-body drop doesn't account for irregular shapes (e.g., protruding bases hit bounds before upper parts fall).
 * Drop mechanics: Components fall as rigid bodies until blocked, but the attempt's one-row-at-a-time check fails for shapes where min fall distance is 0 due to bounds/overlaps; need to compute max uniform shift k where all shifted positions are in-bounds and empty (after clearing old), then shift by k.
 * Removal step likely after falling: Remove groups of 3+ connected same value (possibly 8-connected), then re-apply gravity to remaining cells above; this explains cell count reductions (e.g., example 1 likely removes some 4's after they connect; example 3/2/5 no removal as groups <3 or not triggering). Subtle: Removal may chain (multiple iterations until no matches).
 * Background is most common value (works in attempt); empty space is background.
 * Grid orientation: Row 0 top, higher rows bottom; drop increases row indices.
 * No rotation or color change; preserve all non-removed cells.
 * Subtle: If no space below entire component, it stays; upper components fall onto lowered ones.
 * Per-cell falling (independent per column) doesn't fit examples (e.g., example 1 4's would stack in original columns, not shift right).
 * After removal, gaps cause above cells/components to fall further.
 * All examples require multiple components interacting (e.g., 2 falls onto 8's in example 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This works well for identifying bg, e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test.)

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """Find 4-connected components of same non-background value using flood-fill."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Change to 8-connected: add (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                value = g[i][j]
                component = []

                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == value:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, value))
    return components
```
(Flood-fill for components is essential and correct, but switch to 8-connected for matching/diagonal connections; used successfully for identification, but drop fails after.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
The `drop_one_row` and `drop_component` functions are broken for irregular shapes: they attempt incremental 1-row drops but fail immediately if any part (e.g., base protrusion) hits bounds/overlaps, preventing any movement (e.g., ex1 4's can't drop due to row6 parts going to row7). Do not use in future; replace with max-shift calculation. No removal function exists, causing cell count mismatches where expected removes matches.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identifies background and finds connected components via flood-fill, but 4-connected misses diagonal connections needed for full grouping/matching (e.g., ex2 3's diagonal chain).
 * Sorting components by max row descending (lowest first) works conceptually to avoid upper components blocking lower drops.
 * Rigid-body vertical drop fails for non-rectangular shapes: whole component shifts only if all parts can move equally, but irregular bases hit bottom/bounds first (e.g., ex1 4's L-shape base at row6 prevents drop, output unchanged; similar in ex4 8's/3's).
 * No sideways sliding: expected shows lateral movement when vertical blocked (e.g., ex1 4's shift right to col4-5; ex4 8's/3's shift left, forming snake-like stack).
 * Missing removal step: After drop, connected groups of 3+ same value (likely 8-connected) should be cleared, causing cell count drop (e.g., ex1 generated 6 4's vs expected 4; ex4 generated 6 8's vs 5), then re-drop remaining; without this, outputs retain all cells and don't match.
 * In ex2, partial drop happens (e.g., 2's stack at bottom col7, 4's/3's shift left/up), but not fully (3's/4's not diagonal-stacked correctly; no removal, but counts match as no trigger).
 * In ex3, no drop (generated = input, components at bottom can't move), but expected has 2's stacked left in col6 rows0-6 (top?), 7's/9's shifted right/down in diagonal (suggests left gravity or rotation? but inconsistent; unknown why 2's move up/left).
 * In ex5, no drop (generated = input), expected has 9's/3 shifted up/left, 6's down, suggesting per-component slide + drop.
 * Train 1 mismatches 4's positions/shift (stays left-bottom vs expected right-stacked near top with partial removal); 2/8 stack wrong (2 not on 8's with gap).
 * Train 4 8's/3's stay right-bottom vs expected left-diagonal stack + removal of 1 8.
 * Function `drop_component` is incorrect (incremental fails rigid check; doesn't compute max k or handle slide/removal; don't use).
 * No chaining: After removal, need re-find components and re-drop (missing in all, causes static outputs).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears unchanged from likely input (all components at bottom rows 17-21, no drop possible under rigid vertical rules, top filled with bg 5), but expected should show dropped/stacked components at bottom (higher rows) with possible left/right shifts (e.g., 3's/4's horizontal groups may stack vertically in cols, 8's cluster fall together, 9's shift, 1's/6 single may fall independently), potential removals (e.g., 3's 7 connected >3, remove all; 4's 6 connected, remove; 9's 8 connected, remove; leaving 8's,1's,6 to stack), and re-drop. Without shifts/removal, it ignores interactions (e.g., 1's vertical may fall onto 5's? but bg; 6 single falls). Accounts for large bg 5 (most common), but no movement indicates failed gravity simulation.

[2025-10-02 01:12:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where a background value (most common number) represents empty space, and non-background tiles appear to "fall" or move downward in columns while possibly preserving some horizontal structure or connections, resulting in stacked formations at the bottom of specific columns rather than uniform sliding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Non-background tiles move vertically downward (gravity-like) within their columns, stacking from the bottom up, but horizontal positions are not simply slid left/right—tiles seem to maintain or shift to form vertical stacks in columns where they originated or connected.
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent value, but movement is per-column downward, not row-wise sliding; the previous attempt reversed this by sliding right (horizontal) then up (opposite of gravity).
 * Tiles do not merge or combine values (e.g., no 2048-style addition); they retain their numbers and positions relative to each other in a way that suggests independent column processing after possible horizontal alignment.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but examples vary in size (e.g., 7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); ensure code handles variable n without assuming fixed size.
 * Subtle: In expected outputs, some tiles appear to "float" or shift horizontally slightly before falling (e.g., in training 1, the 4's align in column 4 before falling, and 8's stack in column 5); this may indicate pre-processing like left-alignment per row or object detection for connected groups.
 * Easy to miss: Not all non-background tiles fall uniformly—some examples show partial stacks (e.g., training 3 has a vertical line of 2's in column 6 across top rows, then branching to 7 and 9 in lower rows), suggesting possible rotation, connection-based movement, or multi-step processing (horizontal then vertical).
 * No overwriting or merging occurs; empty spaces fill with background only after movement.
 * Consider connected components: Tiles might form "objects" that fall as units, explaining why shapes are preserved (e.g., in training 4, the 8-3 pair shifts down while rotating or aligning).
 * Process columns independently for vertical movement, but rows may need initial left-packing or no horizontal move at all—previous right-slide disrupted this.
 * Edge case: If all tiles are background, return unchanged; if no non-background, no movement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""
    if not g:
        return 0  # Default if empty
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fall_down_column(col: List[int], background: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Move non-background tiles down in a column, stacking from bottom."""
    non_bg = [x for x in col if x != background]
    new_col = [background] * n
    # Stack from bottom: place non_bg in reverse order from bottom up
    for idx in range(len(non_bg)):
        new_col[n - 1 - idx] = non_bg[-1 - idx]  # Preserve original top-to-bottom order
    return new_col
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used row-wise right-sliding followed by column-wise up-bubbling, which clumped all non-background tiles to the top-right, inverting the expected downward gravity and disrupting horizontal structures.
 * Worked: Correctly identified background via Counter; copied grid to avoid mutation; separated row and column operations.
 * Didn't work: Horizontal right-slide pushed tiles right unnecessarily (expected shows left or no horizontal shift); upward bubbling opposed gravity (expected stacks at bottom); treated all non-bg independently without preserving order or connections, leading to jumbled stacks (e.g., in training 1, generated has 4's and 2 mixed at top-right, expected has aligned 4's falling to mid-bottom in col4, 2 in col5, 8's stacking bottom in col5).
 * In training 1: Generated clumped to rows 0-5 top-right (e.g., row0 ends [4,4,2]), expected has sparse downward stacks (e.g., row1 [...,4,2,0], row3 [...,4,8,0], bottom rows stacked 8's in col5)—difference in direction and no horizontal push.
 * In training 2: Generated slid everything right then up, filling top rows with 7's and clumping 3,4,2 to right columns (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,4]), expected shows diagonal-like fall with 4/3 shifting left-down (e.g., row0 [...,4,7,...], row3 [...,3,7,...], 2 stacking bottom-right in col7)—horizontal left-alignment missing, upward wrong.
 * In training 3: Generated messed up vertical lines (e.g., row0 ends [2,2,7,2], row2 [...,7,7,7]), expected preserves top vertical 2's in col6, then branches 7 right-down to col7, 9 further right-down to col9 with 7 wrap—suggests object tracing or path-following, not simple slide; attempt ignored connections.
 * In training 4: Generated right-up clump (e.g., row0 [...,8,8,3], row3 [...,8,5]), expected shows rotation/shift down-left (e.g., row0 [...,8,0,...], row1 [...,8,3,0,...], row2 [8,3,0,...], then 8-5 fall to col3-4 bottom)—attempt's slide lost the pair's relative positions.
 * In training 5: Generated right-up (e.g., row0 [...,9,9,9,3], row2 [...,9,6]), expected down-left stacks (e.g., row0 [...,9,0,...], row2 [...,9,3,0,...], 9-6 fall to col4-5 bottom)—similar loss of horizontal structure.
 * Function `slide_right_row` is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle (pushes right, but expected often left or none; don't use).
 * Function `bubble_up_column` is wrong direction (up instead of down; reverse to fall_down for future).
 * No object extraction attempted, but may be needed for connected groups—consider adding to trace shapes before falling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (22x22 grid?) clumps non-background tiles (3,8,9,4,6,1) via right-slide then up-bubble, resulting in top-heavy fillings (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,8,8,8,9,8], row8 [...,6], bottom rows all 5's/background)—this looks incorrect as it inverts gravity and mixes tiles horizontally/vertically without structure.
 * Does not match training expected patterns: Expected likely has downward stacks in specific columns (e.g., 3/8/9 falling to bottom in leftish cols, preserving any pairs like 4-3 or 9-6), but generated has top-right mess (e.g., 3's and 9's scattered top, 6/1 low but not stacked bottom)—missing left-align and down-fall.
 * Test has more tiles (3,8x4,9x3,4x2,6,1) scattered initially; output ignores potential connections (e.g., clustered 8's/9's should stack as group bottom, not bubble up).
 * Overall, test output does not make sense—it's a top-right pile-up, while puzzle seems bottom-left/downward formation; update to column-down fall after possible left-row pack to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle simulating gravity on a grid where non-background cells (numbers) fall downward, but connected groups (blobs or "objects") of the same number must fall as rigid, intact units rather than scattering per cell or per column. The goal is to apply gravity such that these connected components drop as wholes until they stack on the bottom, other components, or the grid floor, while preserving their relative shapes and positions within the component.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent number (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 7 across examples), and only non-background cells move; background fills vacated spaces.
 * Connectivity is key: Use 4-connected (up/down/left/right, not diagonal) or possibly 8-connected groups of identical numbers as "objects" that fall rigidly together—do not break them into individual cells or columns.
 * Falling order matters: Components likely need to be processed from lowest to highest (bottom-up simulation) to avoid overlaps or premature stacking; simulate step-by-step drops (one row at a time per component) until no more movement is possible.
 * Stacking rules: When a component falls, it drops until any of its cells hits the bottom row, another stable component below, or background— the entire shape shifts down uniformly.
 * Subtleties: Components can interlock or stack in non-column-aligned ways (e.g., overhanging shapes); horizontal connections across columns must be preserved (e.g., rows of 4's fall as a bar, not splitting). No rotation or deformation—rigid drop only. Handle empty grids or all-background as no-op. Potential for multiple components of the same number to fall separately if not connected. Diagonal connections probably don't count (based on examples where shapes don't merge diagonally). In complex cases (e.g., train3), nested or L-shaped blobs form and fall without filling gaps internally.
 * Edge cases: Grids of varying sizes (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); components touching the bottom don't move; if components would overlap after falling, resolve by order (e.g., lower ones first).
 * All training examples failed because per-column falling ignores connectivity, causing shapes to distort (e.g., horizontal bars become vertical stacks).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `find_background` function is helpful and correct for identifying the background color via frequency count.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The provided `fall_down_column` function is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—it applies gravity per column independently, which splits connected components (do not reuse or adapt directly; it ignores horizontal/vertical bonds).

To solve, need new functions for connected components (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) and rigid falling simulation:

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """
    Returns list of (positions_list, value) for each 4-connected component of same non-bg value.
    Uses flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to identify rigid objects.
    """
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                value = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == value:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((component, value))
    return components
```

```python
def drop_component(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], value: int, background: int, rows: int) -> Tuple[List[List[int]], int]:
    """

    while True:
        # Check if can drop one more row
        can_drop = True
        new_positions = [(r + 1, c) for r, c in component]
        for r, c in new_positions:
            if r + 1 >= rows or g[r + 1][c] != background:
                can_drop = False
                break

        component = new_positions  # Update for next check
    return g, drop_rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used per-column gravity, which worked for identifying background correctly (e.g., 0 in train1/4/5, 7 in train2, 1 in train3) and basic downward stacking in isolated columns, but failed entirely on preserving connected shapes—components split and reformed vertically, distorting blobs (e.g., horizontal groups of 4's or 8's became scattered vertical stacks).
 * Train1: Generated stacked 4's and 8's at bottom of cols independently, but expected shows a connected "L" or bar of 4's falling as a unit to mid-right, with 2 and 8 stacking adjacently without splitting; difference: generated has 4's duplicated/stacked wrong in col3/6, 2 misplaced high.
 * Train2: Generated per-column drop turned horizontal 3's/4's into verticals at bottom, with 2 isolated; expected keeps some horizontal structure and stacks 3's/4's as partial bars in cols3-5, with 2 at bottom col7—difference: generated has 3's only in bottom row col3, 4's split vertically in col4, ignoring connections.
 * Train3: Generated crammed everything to bottom rows with vertical stacks (e.g., 7's and 9's aligned in cols), but expected spreads shapes horizontally (e.g., 7's form an L-shape across rows7-16 in varying cols, 9's horizontal in cols9-10); difference: generated ignores blob shapes entirely, filling bottom uniformly; 2's stacked vertically in col6.
 * Train4: Generated vertical stacks of 3's/8's in cols2-4, 5's isolated in col4; expected rotates/stacks as connected: 8's and 3's form a snake-like drop across cols1-3, 5's vertical in col4—difference: generated has 8's horizontal at bottom row9 but 3's split, no overhanging.
 * Train5: Generated 9's horizontal at bottom row8, 3's vertical in col3, 6's vertical in col5; expected drops 9's as a connected blob wrapping around 3's and 6's (horizontal in row0 col4, vertical in col2 rows2-4, etc.)—difference: generated keeps 9's flat but positions 3 and 6 wrong, no wrapping connectivity.
 * `fall_down_column` is broken/not helpful—it's column-centric and doesn't handle cross-column connections (avoid in future; replace with component-based dropping).
 * No extraction of objects in attempt, which is essential for identifying rigid blobs—future attempts must include connected component detection to group cells properly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it applies the same flawed per-column gravity, resulting in mostly uniform 5's (background?) filling the grid, with mismatched blobs crammed to the bottom rows (e.g., 8's/3's/4's/9's stacked vertically in cols2-13 row20-21, 1/6 isolated). This ignores connectivity, turning what should be rigid shapes (e.g., horizontal 8's in row19, clustered 3's/4's in row20, 9's in row20) into disconnected vertical piles, similar to training failures. It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected output should preserve blob shapes (e.g., horizontal bars of 4's or 9's dropping as units, possibly interlocking with 8's or 3's without splitting). Without the exact expected test output, it's unclear on precise stacking, but the uniform bottom-filling and shape distortion confirm it's wrong—likely needs component extraction to handle the clustered non-5's (1,3,4,6,8,9) as falling objects.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where non-background colors (treated as "objects" or blobs) are rearranged into vertical stacks within the grid, likely simulating gravity or consolidation rules, while preserving the background (most common color, often 0 or 7 or 1 or 5) and avoiding overlaps. The goal appears to be grouping each color into a single vertical column based on some positional heuristic (e.g., average or median column of original positions), then stacking instances of that color contiguously from the bottom of the grid upward, but the exact ordering of colors and stacking direction/start point is critical and not fully captured.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is correctly identified as the most frequent value (e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test), and all non-background positions are cleared to it before repopulating.
 * Each non-background color is treated as independent "objects" or instances, collected by their original positions; the number of instances per color must be preserved exactly (e.g., four 4's, one 2, four 8's in ex1).
 * Column selection for stacking seems based on original positions of that color (e.g., average column works partially but fails when positions are spread out, as in ex1 where 4's avg to col2 but should be col4; perhaps use median column or leftmost/rightmost instead to better match expected clustering).
 * Stacking is vertical (same column for all instances of a color), but direction and starting point are wrong: current code stacks from the minimum original row upward (top-down), leading to mid-grid or top placements (e.g., 2 at row1 in ex1, 9's starting mid in ex3); expected often stacks from the bottom upward (gravity-like, filling from row n-1 down to cover exactly k rows where k=count of color).
 * Overlaps occur when multiple colors average to the same column (e.g., 4 and 8 both trying col5? in ex1 generated, but code overwrites sequentially); expected avoids this by assigning distinct columns or adjusting positions (e.g., ex1 uses col4 for 4's and col5 for 2/8, with 2 floating higher).
 * Subtle ordering: Colors may need to be processed in a specific sequence (e.g., by color value ascending/descending, or by original appearance order) to resolve column conflicts; in ex2, 4's and 3's interleave slightly before full stacking, suggesting partial horizontal preservation or blob connectivity.
 * Blobs/connectivity: If same-color adjacent cells form "blobs," they might need to be treated as single units (e.g., in ex4, 3's are stacked but shifted left; generated treats individually, leading to col2 for 3's but expected col3 with diagonal flavor); however, examples suggest individual cells, not strict blobs, but adjacency might influence column choice.
 * Grid size varies (7x7 in ex1/3, 12x12? in ex2, 10x10 in ex4, 9x9 in ex5, 22x22? in test with 22 elems/row), so n=len(g) is essential; ensure placements stay within bounds (0 <= r < n, 0 <= c < n).
 * Edge cases: Single-instance colors (e.g., 2 in ex1) don't stack but may "float" higher than full stacks (row1 vs bottom); empty colors or all-bg grids return unchanged.
 * No rotation, mirroring, or horizontal movement beyond column selection; output must match expected exactly, including 0/bg positions.
 * Potential miss: In ex3, 2's stack top-to-mid in col6, 7's shift right/down to col7 rows6-12 then col9-10, 9's at col9 rows9-11 with 7 below; suggests column assignment might prioritize original median col and stack from bottom, but with color ordering affecting overlaps (e.g., place lower colors first).
 * In ex5, diagonal-like preservation (9 and 3 interleave in cols 2-3) hints at not fully collapsing to single column per color—perhaps stack in original columns but drop down vertically per column independently (simple gravity per column), but that fails ex1 (would keep 4's scattered).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def identify_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identifies the most common color as background."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0  # or default
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
```python
def collect_positions_by_color(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> dict[int, list[tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Collects (row, col) positions for each non-background color."""
    n = len(g)
    positions = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != bg:
                positions.setdefault(c, []).append((i, j))
    return positions
```
```python
def compute_column_for_color(positions: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    """Computes a column for stacking; current avg, but consider median: sorted_cols = sorted(j for _, j in positions); return sorted_cols[len(sorted_cols)//2]"""
    if not positions:
        return 0
    cols = [j for _, j in positions]
    return sum(cols) // len(cols)  # Avg; alternative: min(cols) or max(cols) for edges
```
(Note: The clear_and_place logic in the original program is partially helpful but broken due to top-down stacking and no conflict resolution; avoid sequential overwriting without checks.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions/tools:**
 * The stacking loop in the original program (`for idx in range(k): r = min_row + idx; grid[r][avg_col] = c`) is broken: uses min_row (top-biased) instead of bottom-up (e.g., r = n - 1 - idx), causes overlaps without checking if cell is free, and doesn't handle color ordering.
 * Flat list creation is redundant if using row/col loops; Counter on flat is fine but not essential beyond bg.
 * No blob extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) was attempted, but it might be irrelevant since examples treat cells individually; don't pursue unless diagonals suggest otherwise (unproven).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg and collects per-color positions, which is a core step, but fails all training due to wrong stacking mechanics.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 2 at row1 col5 (partial match for position but wrong height), 4's at rows3-6 col2 (wrong col, overwrites potential space, should be col4 rows1-4 with offset), 8's at rows3-6 col5 (correct col but overwrites 2's space and starts too high; expected has 8's bottom 4 rows col5, 4's shifted left, 2 higher in col5).
 * Train 2: Generated repeats 4's top 3 rows col4 (close but no interleaving with 3's at col3), then 3's mid-bottom col4 (overwrites), 2's bottom col7 (partial col match); expected has 4's col4 top, 3's col3 rows1-2 then col4 bottom-up with gaps, 2's col7 bottom—mismatch in interleaving and full bottom-stacking.
 * Train 3: Generated 2's top-mid col6 (correct col but too many rows? wait, stacks 7 times but count=7?), 7's mid-bottom col10 (wrong col, should shift to col7 then col9), 9's bottom col9 (correct col but overlaps 7's); expected preserves top 2's stack, shifts 7's right/down in steps, 9's mid with 7 below—suggests non-overwrite placement order by row or color.
 * Train 4: Generated 3's rows1-3 col2 (wrong col and top-start), 8's rows4-8 col2 (overwrites 3's, wrong col), 5's rows4-8 col4 (partial col but overlaps); expected spreads 8/3 diagonally left in cols2-3 top-mid, then 5's bottom col4—mismatch indicates possible per-column gravity with horizontal shift for connections.
 * Train 5: Generated 3's rows2-3 col3 (correct col but mid, not top-diagonal), 9's row5 col1 (wrong col), 6's rows5-8 col5 (partial col); expected diagonals 9/3 in cols2-3 rows2-3, then 9 row4 col3, 6 bottom col5—suggests preserving relative horizontal positions while dropping vertically.
 * Overall: Avg column heuristic works for some (e.g., 8's col in ex1), but fails spread-out colors (4's in ex1); top-down stacking causes mid/top placements vs expected bottom-up; no overlap resolution leads to overwrites (e.g., multiple colors in col3 ex test); individual cell treatment ignores potential blob/diagonal preservation.
 * extract_objects equivalent (positions dict) is essential for grouping; without it, can't isolate colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows messy mid-grid stacking with overlaps and top-biased placements (e.g., 8's rows1-3 col3, 9's rows4-12 col11, 3's rows8-13 col3 overwriting 8's, 6 at row17 col7, 4/1 at row19-21 col4/8), leaving top/bottom mostly bg=5 but no clear vertical consolidation per color.
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., no bottom-up full stacks, colors like 8/3/9 crammed in few columns with overwrites, 4/1/6 not dropped fully); likely wrong because column avgs cluster too many (8/3 in col3), stacking starts high (e.g., 8's at row1 vs bottom), and no ordering to space out columns (e.g., 9 at col11 far right, but test input likely has spread positions).
 * To handle test, need bottom-up stacking (r = n - k + idx or n-1 - idx), median col instead of avg for outliers, place colors in sorted order (e.g., by min color value) with column adjustment if occupied, and check for per-column gravity alternative if diagonals persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a puzzle simulating gravity in a 2D grid where non-background cells of the same value form connected components that fall downward (increasing row index, assuming row 0 is top), stacking on the bottom or other components, similar to match-3 games like Candy Crush or Puyo Puyo, but with evidence of a removal step for matched groups (3+ connected same value) after falling, as cell counts decrease in some examples (e.g., example 1: 6 to 4 for value 4; example 4: 6 to 5 for value 8).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are groups of same-value non-background cells; the attempt uses 4-connected (up/down/left/right), but examples suggest 8-connected (including diagonals) may be needed for proper grouping and potential matching, as seen in expected diagonal chains (e.g., example 2 3's form a diagonal line).
 * Gravity is downward (vertical drop only in the attempt, but examples show possible sideways shifting or sliding when blocked, e.g., example 1 4's shift right to col4-5; example 4 8's/3's shift left to col1-3).
 * Processing order is critical: sort by lowest point (max row) descending to drop bottom components first, avoiding interference; the attempt does this correctly, but fails because rigid-body drop doesn't account for irregular shapes (e.g., protruding bases hit bounds before upper parts fall).
 * Drop mechanics: Components fall as rigid bodies until blocked, but the attempt's one-row-at-a-time check fails for shapes where min fall distance is 0 due to bounds/overlaps; need to compute max uniform shift k where all shifted positions are in-bounds and empty (after clearing old), then shift by k.
 * Removal step likely after falling: Remove groups of 3+ connected same value (possibly 8-connected), then re-apply gravity to remaining cells above; this explains cell count reductions (e.g., example 1 likely removes some 4's after they connect; example 3/2/5 no removal as groups <3 or not triggering). Subtle: Removal may chain (multiple iterations until no matches).
 * Background is most common value (works in attempt); empty space is background.
 * Grid orientation: Row 0 top, higher rows bottom; drop increases row indices.
 * No rotation or color change; preserve all non-removed cells.
 * Subtle: If no space below entire component, it stays; upper components fall onto lowered ones.
 * Per-cell falling (independent per column) doesn't fit examples (e.g., example 1 4's would stack in original columns, not shift right).
 * After removal, gaps cause above cells/components to fall further.
 * All examples require multiple components interacting (e.g., 2 falls onto 8's in example 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This works well for identifying bg, e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test.)

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """Find 4-connected components of same non-background value using flood-fill."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Change to 8-connected: add (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                value = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == value:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, value))
    return components
```
(Flood-fill for components is essential and correct, but switch to 8-connected for matching/diagonal connections; used successfully for identification, but drop fails after.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
The `drop_one_row` and `drop_component` functions are broken for irregular shapes: they attempt incremental 1-row drops but fail immediately if any part (e.g., base protrusion) hits bounds/overlaps, preventing any movement (e.g., ex1 4's can't drop due to row6 parts going to row7). Do not use in future; replace with max-shift calculation. No removal function exists, causing cell count mismatches where expected removes matches.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identifies background and finds connected components via flood-fill, but 4-connected misses diagonal connections needed for full grouping/matching (e.g., ex2 3's diagonal chain).
 * Sorting components by max row descending (lowest first) works conceptually to avoid upper components blocking lower drops.
 * Rigid-body vertical drop fails for non-rectangular shapes: whole component shifts only if all parts can move equally, but irregular bases hit bottom/bounds first (e.g., ex1 4's L-shape base at row6 prevents drop, output unchanged; similar in ex4 8's/3's).
 * No sideways sliding: expected shows lateral movement when vertical blocked (e.g., ex1 4's shift right to col4-5; ex4 8's/3's shift left, forming snake-like stack).
 * Missing removal step: After drop, connected groups of 3+ same value (likely 8-connected) should be cleared, causing cell count drop (e.g., ex1 generated 6 4's vs expected 4; ex4 generated 6 8's vs 5), then re-drop remaining; without this, outputs retain all cells and don't match.
 * In ex2, partial drop happens (e.g., 2's stack at bottom col7, 4's/3's shift left/up), but not fully (3's/4's not diagonal-stacked correctly; no removal, but counts match as no trigger).
 * In ex3, no drop (generated = input, components at bottom can't move), but expected has 2's stacked left in col6 rows0-6 (top?), 7's/9's shifted right/down in diagonal (suggests left gravity or rotation? but inconsistent; unknown why 2's move up/left).
 * In ex5, no drop (generated = input), expected has 9's/3 shifted up/left, 6's down, suggesting per-component slide + drop.
 * Train 1 mismatches 4's positions/shift (stays left-bottom vs expected right-stacked near top with partial removal); 2/8 stack wrong (2 not on 8's with gap).
 * Train 4 8's/3's stay right-bottom vs expected left-diagonal stack + removal of 1 8.
 * Function `drop_component` is incorrect (incremental fails rigid check; doesn't compute max k or handle slide/removal; don't use).
 * No chaining: After removal, need re-find components and re-drop (missing in all, causes static outputs).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears unchanged from likely input (all components at bottom rows 17-21, no drop possible under rigid vertical rules, top filled with bg 5), but expected should show dropped/stacked components at bottom (higher rows) with possible left/right shifts (e.g., 3's/4's horizontal groups may stack vertically in cols, 8's cluster fall together, 9's shift, 1's/6 single may fall independently), potential removals (e.g., 3's 7 connected >3, remove all; 4's 6 connected, remove; 9's 8 connected, remove; leaving 8's,1's,6 to stack), and re-drop. Without shifts/removal, it ignores interactions (e.g., 1's vertical may fall onto 5's? but bg; 6 single falls). Accounts for large bg 5 (most common), but no movement indicates failed gravity simulation.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 01:38:00] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return g
    bg = find_background(g)
    grid = [row[:] for row in g]
    for _ in range(n):
        moved = False
        new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
        for r in range(n - 1):
            for c in range(n):

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 01:39:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 2D grid where non-background cells (representing objects or particles of different types/numbers) are subject to gravity, causing them to fall downward toward the bottom of the grid until they reach a stable position. The simulation must account for objects potentially sliding left or right (or diagonally) to settle into the lowest possible configuration, while preserving relative shapes or connections where applicable, resulting in a final "settled" grid that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common number in the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 7 across examples), and only non-background cells move; background cells remain fixed as empty space.
 * Movement is downward due to gravity, but objects do not fall straight down independently—instead, they seem to settle in a way that maintains vertical stacks or connected shapes (e.g., in Training 1, the 4's form a vertical column in col 4, with 2 and 8's adjacent in col 5; in Training 2, numbers like 4, 3, 2 form diagonal or stepped patterns rather than flat piles).
 * Subtle sliding: If directly below is blocked, objects may shift left/right to the nearest empty space below (possibly diagonally), but not arbitrarily—expected outputs show minimal horizontal disruption, keeping objects in roughly their original column ranges (e.g., no excessive leftward drift).
 * Connected components: Objects of the same number may be treated as rigid or semi-rigid blobs that fall together (e.g., in Training 4, the 8's and 3's maintain a zigzag shape when fallen; in Training 5, 9's and 3's stack with 6's below without merging). Different numbers do not merge or block each other unless stacked.
 * Iteration until stable: Simulate steps until no more moves are possible, but process in a way that avoids overwriting or premature blocking (e.g., top-to-bottom row processing can cause chain reactions, but current impl leads to clumping).
 * Edge cases: Grids of varying sizes (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); empty or all-background grids return unchanged; objects at bottom don't move; multiple object types interact by stacking vertically but not horizontally overlapping unless connected.
 * No rotation or deformation: Shapes drop as wholes or cell-by-cell but end up in expected low-energy states (e.g., Training 3 shows a complex shape with 2's, 7's, 9's spread across cols 6-11 but settled in a tree-like vertical structure).
 * Order of movement matters: Processing from top rows first can cause upper objects to fall and block lower ones incorrectly; diagonal moves (down-left/right) are attempted but over-applied in current code, leading to unwanted sliding.
 * Final stability: No floating objects; everything non-background is at the bottom, stacked from row n-1 upward, with gaps filled by background only where no stacking occurs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This function correctly identifies the background and is essential for distinguishing movable objects from empty space.)

```python
# Potential helpful: Extract connected components (blobs) of same-number cells to treat as rigid units.
# Not implemented in previous attempt, but could prevent cell-by-cell errors.
from typing import Tuple, List

def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    # Returns list of objects, each as [(row, col, value)] for connected same-value cells (4-connected or 8-connected).
    # Use DFS/BFS to find components; skip if not implemented yet.
    visited = [[False] * len(g[0]) for _ in range(len(g))]
    objects = []
    for r in range(len(g)):
        for c in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                component = []
                stack = [(r, c)]
                val = g[r][c]
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    if visited[cr][cc] or g[cr][cc] != val:
                        continue
                    visited[cr][cc] = True
                    component.append((cr, cc, val))
                    # Add 4-neighbors (up, down, left, right); extend to 8 for diagonals if needed.
                    for dr, dc in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                        nr, nc = cr + dr, cc + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < len(g) and 0 <= nc < len(g[0]) and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                if component:
                    objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This would help identify and move entire blobs rigidly downward, preserving shapes—key for matching expected configurations; current attempt lacks this, leading to disassembly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly detects background (e.g., 0 in Train 1/4/5, 7 in Train 2, 1 in Train 3) and runs an iterative simulation loop until no moves occur, which is a good core structure for gravity.
 * Simulation attempts downward moves (straight or diagonal) if below is empty, which partially captures gravity but over-applies diagonals, causing excessive left/right sliding (e.g., in Train 1, 4's shift left to cols 1-4 instead of staying near col 4-5; in Train 2, 4/3/2 pile flat at bottom instead of stepped verticals).
 * All training examples failed: Train 1 generated a left-clumped pile ([0,4,4,4,4,8,8] in row 6, [0,0,0,0,2,8,8] in row 5) vs. expected vertical stack in cols 4-5 with gaps ([0,0,0,0,4,2,0] etc.); difference is unwanted horizontal compression and no shape preservation—unknown why diagonals caused left bias, but it disrupts columns.
 * Train 2 generated full-background upper rows with bottom pile ([7,7,7,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2] in row 11, etc.) vs. expected sparse vertical/diagonal drops (e.g., 4's in col 4 rows 0-4, 3's stepping down); failed to spread objects, clumping them instead—diagonal moves likely merged them incorrectly.
 * Train 3 generated near-all-background with bottom mess ([1,1,1,1,1,2,2,7,2,2,1,1,1,1] wait, actually [1's] with partial clump in row 16) vs. expected tall vertical structure (2's in col 6 rows 0-6, 7's/9's branching rightward); huge difference in vertical extent and positioning—sim treats cells independently, ignoring connections.
 * Train 4 generated bottom rows with partial clump ([0,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5] in row 9, etc.) vs. expected zigzag verticals (8's/3's alternating cols 2-3, 5's in col 4); failed to alternate positions, stacking horizontally instead.
 * Train 5 generated bottom clump ([9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6] in row 8, [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0] in row 7) vs. expected verticals (9's in col 3 rows 0-4, 3's col 2 rows 2-3, 6's col 5 rows 5-8); again, clumping without column preservation.
 * No training passed, indicating core issue: cell-by-cell movement without blob extraction or proper collision handling leads to disassembly and incorrect settling.
 * The diagonal move logic (down-right/left) is broken/not helpful—intended for sliding but causes over-sliding and bias (e.g., prefers left in some cases); remove or condition it better (e.g., only if straight down blocked and side is lowest).
 * No other functions tried; extract_objects (suggested above) is essential for future attempts to handle connected same-number groups rigidly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it shows a large all-5 background grid (22 cols? assuming n=22 based on lists) with objects (8,3,6,9,4,1) clumped messily in the bottom 4 rows (e.g., row 20: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,6,8,9,9,9,9,5,...] with horizontal spreading and mixing of types, row 21: [3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,9,9,5,...]), while upper rows are pure 5's.
 * This is incorrect because expected likely mirrors training: objects should fall into distinct vertical stacks or preserved shapes in their approximate original columns (e.g., 8's/3's/4's/1's/9's/6 in separate cols without merging into a flat pile; e.g., 4's might stack in one col, 9's in another, with minimal sliding). The clumping ignores connections (e.g., 9's and 1's should not horizontally blend) and over-slides (similar to training failures), resulting in a non-stable, merged mess instead of separated low positions—does not make sense as a final gravity state, as it looks unstable and shape-destroying.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 01:40:27] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 01:45:14] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, I analyzed the input and output lists for consistent patterns of interaction or effect between elements (e.g., how properties like color, position via bbox, shape size via pixels, or topology via holes influence changes). Only patterns observed in **every** train example (1 through 5) are included below. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are attempted. Interactions that are not present in all examples (e.g., hole-related splitting in trains 2 and 3 only, or color-specific rearrangements in trains 4 and 5 only) are excluded. Where no clear causal link can be established across all examples, it is noted as unknown.

#### Core Components
- **Colored polyominoes**: All examples consist of unit-square polyominoes (connected groups of same-color pixels), described by:
  - Color (e.g., Red, Yellow, Green, Maroon/Dark Red, Blue/Light Blue, Pink, Orange).
  - Holes (integer count of enclosed empty regions within the polyomino; 0 in most small components, >0 only in some large ones).
  - Bounding box (bbox = [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y], indicating spatial position and extent).
  - Pixels (area/size in unit squares, correlating with shape complexity; ranges from 1 for monominoes to hundreds for large shapes).
- These are the primary components; no other elements (e.g., explicit grid or non-colored spaces) are represented in the data.

#### Consistent Interconnections Across All Train Examples
The following interactions/effects are observed in **every** train input/output pair. They involve how properties of one component influence changes in others (or itself) in the output. Changes are typically in position (bbox shifts), connectivity (splitting into more components), or size (pixels redistribution), but the exact causal mechanism (e.g., why a specific shift occurs) is unknown without further solving.

1. **Unchanged components (no interaction effect)**:
   - Certain polyominoes remain identical in all properties (color, holes, exact bbox, pixels) from input to output.
   - Effect: These components do not appear to interact with or affect any other components; they are "fixed" and isolated in their transformation.
   - Examples across all trains:
     - Train 1: Red ([5,1,5,1], 1 pixel) and Maroon ([5,3,5,6], 4 pixels).
     - Train 2: Yellow ([4,0,4,2], 3 pixels), Green ([6,5,6,5], 1 pixel), Red ([7,5,7,11], 7 pixels).
     - Train 3: Red ([6,0,6,6], 7 pixels), Dark Red ([7,6,7,6], 1 pixel), Light Blue ([9,9,9,11], 3 pixels).
     - Train 4: Green ([3,1,3,1], 1 pixel), Green ([2,2,2,2], 1 pixel), Green ([3,3,3,3], 1 pixel), Orange ([4,4,4,9], 6 pixels).
     - Train 5: Green ([3,2,3,3], 2 pixels), Light Blue ([4,5,4,5], 1 pixel), Pink ([5,5,5,8], 4 pixels).
   - Interconnection: Position (bbox) appears linked to stability—components with low min_y (near "bottom" of grid, e.g., y=0 to y=3) or rightward max_x (e.g., x>=4) are more likely unchanged, but this is correlational, not causal (unknown rule). No effect on other components.

2. **Position (bbox) -> Shape transformation (splitting or shifting)**:
   - Components with overlapping or adjacent bbox (e.g., shared x/y ranges within 1-2 units) in input often result in output components that are split (more smaller polyominoes of same color) or shifted (bbox y decreases, suggesting downward movement).
   - Effect: Interacting components (via proximity) lose connectivity, redistributing pixels into new positions; isolated components (no bbox overlap/adjacency) do not change.
   - Consistent across all: At least 1-3 components per example show bbox y-min decrease (e.g., from y=6+ to y=0-4), indicating position influences movement direction (downward bias). Pixel totals for the color may redistribute but are not always preserved (decreases in trains 1 and 4 suggest loss to background or unknown effect).
   - Examples:
     - Train 1: Adjacent Yellow ([2,3,4,5]) and Maroon ([5,3,5,6]) → Yellow splits/shifts to [4,1,4,3] (y 3-5 → 1-3) and new [5,0,5,0]; original small Yellow ([1,6,1,6]) disappears (position effect unknown).
     - Train 2: Adjacent Greens ([5,6,5,7] and [3,8,4,8]) to large Dark Red → split into new positions [3,1,3,2], [4,3,4,3], [5,4,5,4] (y 5-8 → 1-4).
     - Train 3: Adjacent small Dark Reds to large Blue → rearranged to new bboxes like [8,7,8,7], [9,8,9,8] (y 2-6 → 7-8, but within larger y-range).
     - Train 4: Upper Maroon ([1,6,2,8]) adjacent to lower Maroon/Greens → split/shifted to [3,0,3,0], [2,1,2,1], etc. (y 6-8 → 0-4).
     - Train 5: Upper Light Blues ([3,6,3,6] and [0,7,2,8]) near Green → split/shifted to [4,0,4,0], [3,1,3,1], [2,2,2,3] (y 6-8 → 0-4).
   - Interconnection: Bbox proximity (position) directly effects transformation (splits/shifts); non-proximal components unaffected. Specific shift distance or split count unknown.

3. **Color -> Preservation amid change**:
   - All colors present in input appear in output (no color creation or total elimination).
   - Effect: Changes (splits/shifts) occur within the same color groups; different colors do not exchange pixels or properties.
   - Consistent across all: Total pixels per color are roughly preserved (exact in trains 2, 3, 5; minor decreases in 1 and 4, possibly due to position-based loss at grid edges, e.g., low x/min_y). Holes remain 0 for small components; large components (if present) may alter holes, but this is not universal.
   - Interconnection: Color acts as a "grouping" property, linking pixels of the same color for redistribution (e.g., one Yellow splits into multiple Yellows). No cross-color effects observed consistently.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Aspects
- **Hole count -> Any effect**: Holes >0 only in trains 2 and 3 (large components); no change or interaction in trains 1, 4, 5. Cannot explain transformations involving holes (e.g., splitting in train 2 vs. increase in train 3) as unknown—not consistent across all.
- **Pixels -> Color change or creation**: Minor pixel losses in some colors (trains 1, 4) have no clear link to other properties; possibly interacts with background (black to orange), but unexplainable without visuals—unknown.
- **Shape type (e.g., straight bar vs. L/zigzag via bbox/pixels)**: Bars (e.g., vertical with min_x = max_x) often unchanged, but not always (some split in train 2); complex shapes (pixels >3, wider bbox) always transform—link to position, but specific effect unknown.
- **Background influence**: Input black/output orange noted in description, but not in data; possible indirect effect on edge positions (e.g., y=0 additions), but unconfirmable—unknown.
- No other properties (e.g., silhouette edges, color-to-color direct effects like Yellow affecting Green) show consistent interaction across all examples; many appear example-specific.

This list captures only obvious, universal patterns without inferring a full rule. For test inputs, the same components/properties would apply, but no further analysis is performed as it risks solving.

[2025-10-02 01:45:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, I analyzed the input and output lists for consistent patterns of interaction or effect between elements (e.g., how properties like color, position via bbox, shape size via pixels, or topology via holes influence changes). Only patterns observed in **every** train example (1 through 5) are included below. No high-level puzzle solution or forced explanations are attempted. Interactions that are not present in all examples (e.g., hole-related splitting in trains 2 and 3 only, or color-specific rearrangements in trains 4 and 5 only) are excluded. Where no clear causal link can be established across all examples, it is noted as unknown.

#### Core Components
- **Colored polyominoes**: All examples consist of unit-square polyominoes (connected groups of same-color pixels), described by:
  - Color (e.g., Red, Yellow, Green, Maroon/Dark Red, Blue/Light Blue, Pink, Orange).
  - Holes (integer count of enclosed empty regions within the polyomino; 0 in most small components, >0 only in some large ones).
  - Bounding box (bbox = [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y], indicating spatial position and extent).
  - Pixels (area/size in unit squares, correlating with shape complexity; ranges from 1 for monominoes to hundreds for large shapes).
- These are the primary components; no other elements (e.g., explicit grid or non-colored spaces) are represented in the data.

#### Consistent Interconnections Across All Train Examples
The following interactions/effects are observed in **every** train input/output pair. They involve how properties of one component influence changes in others (or itself) in the output. Changes are typically in position (bbox shifts), connectivity (splitting into more components), or size (pixels redistribution), but the exact causal mechanism (e.g., why a specific shift occurs) is unknown without further solving.

1. **Unchanged components (no interaction effect)**:
   - Certain polyominoes remain identical in all properties (color, holes, exact bbox, pixels) from input to output.
   - Effect: These components do not appear to interact with or affect any other components; they are "fixed" and isolated in their transformation.
   - Examples across all trains:
     - Train 1: Red ([5,1,5,1], 1 pixel) and Maroon ([5,3,5,6], 4 pixels).
     - Train 2: Yellow ([4,0,4,2], 3 pixels), Green ([6,5,6,5], 1 pixel), Red ([7,5,7,11], 7 pixels).
     - Train 3: Red ([6,0,6,6], 7 pixels), Dark Red ([7,6,7,6], 1 pixel), Light Blue ([9,9,9,11], 3 pixels).
     - Train 4: Green ([3,1,3,1], 1 pixel), Green ([2,2,2,2], 1 pixel), Green ([3,3,3,3], 1 pixel), Orange ([4,4,4,9], 6 pixels).
     - Train 5: Green ([3,2,3,3], 2 pixels), Light Blue ([4,5,4,5], 1 pixel), Pink ([5,5,5,8], 4 pixels).
   - Interconnection: Position (bbox) appears linked to stability—components with low min_y (near "bottom" of grid, e.g., y=0 to y=3) or rightward max_x (e.g., x>=4) are more likely unchanged, but this is correlational, not causal (unknown rule). No effect on other components.

2. **Position (bbox) -> Shape transformation (splitting or shifting)**:
   - Components with overlapping or adjacent bbox (e.g., shared x/y ranges within 1-2 units) in input often result in output components that are split (more smaller polyominoes of same color) or shifted (bbox y decreases, suggesting downward movement).
   - Effect: Interacting components (via proximity) lose connectivity, redistributing pixels into new positions; isolated components (no bbox overlap/adjacency) do not change.
   - Consistent across all: At least 1-3 components per example show bbox y-min decrease (e.g., from y=6+ to y=0-4), indicating position influences movement direction (downward bias). Pixel totals for the color may redistribute but are not always preserved (decreases in trains 1 and 4 suggest loss to background or unknown effect).
   - Examples:
     - Train 1: Adjacent Yellow ([2,3,4,5]) and Maroon ([5,3,5,6]) → Yellow splits/shifts to [4,1,4,3] (y 3-5 → 1-3) and new [5,0,5,0]; original small Yellow ([1,6,1,6]) disappears (position effect unknown).
     - Train 2: Adjacent Greens ([5,6,5,7] and [3,8,4,8]) to large Dark Red → split into new positions [3,1,3,2], [4,3,4,3], [5,4,5,4] (y 5-8 → 1-4).
     - Train 3: Adjacent small Dark Reds to large Blue → rearranged to new bboxes like [8,7,8,7], [9,8,9,8] (y 2-6 → 7-8, but within larger y-range).
     - Train 4: Upper Maroon ([1,6,2,8]) adjacent to lower Maroon/Greens → split/shifted to [3,0,3,0], [2,1,2,1], etc. (y 6-8 → 0-4).
     - Train 5: Upper Light Blues ([3,6,3,6] and [0,7,2,8]) near Green → split/shifted to [4,0,4,0], [3,1,3,1], [2,2,2,3] (y 6-8 → 0-4).
   - Interconnection: Bbox proximity (position) directly effects transformation (splits/shifts); non-proximal components unaffected. Specific shift distance or split count unknown.

3. **Color -> Preservation amid change**:
   - All colors present in input appear in output (no color creation or total elimination).
   - Effect: Changes (splits/shifts) occur within the same color groups; different colors do not exchange pixels or properties.
   - Consistent across all: Total pixels per color are roughly preserved (exact in trains 2, 3, 5; minor decreases in 1 and 4, possibly due to position-based loss at grid edges, e.g., low x/min_y). Holes remain 0 for small components; large components (if present) may alter holes, but this is not universal.
   - Interconnection: Color acts as a "grouping" property, linking pixels of the same color for redistribution (e.g., one Yellow splits into multiple Yellows). No cross-color effects observed consistently.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Aspects
- **Hole count -> Any effect**: Holes >0 only in trains 2 and 3 (large components); no change or interaction in trains 1, 4, 5. Cannot explain transformations involving holes (e.g., splitting in train 2 vs. increase in train 3) as unknown—not consistent across all.
- **Pixels -> Color change or creation**: Minor pixel losses in some colors (trains 1, 4) have no clear link to other properties; possibly interacts with background (black to orange), but unexplainable without visuals—unknown.
- **Shape type (e.g., straight bar vs. L/zigzag via bbox/pixels)**: Bars (e.g., vertical with min_x = max_x) often unchanged, but not always (some split in train 2); complex shapes (pixels >3, wider bbox) always transform—link to position, but specific effect unknown.
- **Background influence**: Input black/output orange noted in description, but not in data; possible indirect effect on edge positions (e.g., y=0 additions), but unconfirmable—unknown.
- No other properties (e.g., silhouette edges, color-to-color direct effects like Yellow affecting Green) show consistent interaction across all examples; many appear example-specific.

This list captures only obvious, universal patterns without inferring a full rule. For test inputs, the same components/properties would apply, but no further analysis is performed as it risks solving.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 01:57:40] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the background color is identified, non-background connected components (objects of the same color) are extracted, some components are "fixed" and remain in place while others are "moved" or restructured according to spatial rules (possibly shifting toward the right, bottom, or specific alignments while preserving or adapting shapes), and the result is recomposed into a new grid. The goal is to infer and apply rules that match the expected outputs, which often involve relocating or reshaping moving components without overlapping or losing pixels unnecessarily.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color, correctly identified in all examples (e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3), but components must exclude it precisely using 4-connected (up/down/left/right) adjacency, not 8-connected, to avoid merging unrelated pixels.
 * Components are grouped by color, and each color's components are processed separately; multiple components per color exist (e.g., ex1 has separate 2 and 8, ex2 has 2/3/4), but the program treats them individually without merging or ordering by size/color value.
 * Fixed vs. moving distinction is crucial but mishandled: fixed components seem to be those touching specific borders (e.g., top or right in expectations, like vertical stacks on the right in ex1/ex2), while moving ones are relocated (e.g., to the right side or bottom, often vertically aligned but preserving approximate shape or connectivity, not just flattened to a column).
 * Transformations for moving components must preserve pixel count and rough shape (e.g., ex1 expected keeps 4's somewhat vertical on right with 2/8 attached below; ex4/5 show diagonal or L-shapes rotated/flipped to bottom-right), but avoid overlaps by placing in available space (e.g., col4-5 in ex1, not col0); the program's "straighten vertically in leftmost column" loses shape, caps at n pixels (causing truncation), and ignores direction (should be rightward or downward "gravity").
 * Subtle elements: Moving components may rotate 90 degrees (e.g., ex4/5 show horizontal-to-vertical shifts), attach to fixed ones without overwriting (e.g., ex1's 2 between 4 and 8), or stack by color order (low to high? ex2 has 2 at bottom, 3 above, 4 top); grids vary in size (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9), so rules must scale; no pixel loss unless conflict, but program causes loss via capping.
 * Ordering: Components may be placed by color ascending/descending or size, starting from bottom-right (e.g., ex2's 2 spans rows 6-11 in col7, 3 in col4 rows3-5, 4 in col4 rows0-2); fixed ones anchor positions (e.g., ex1's implied fixed 8 stays low-right).
 * Edge cases: Large backgrounds (ex2/3) dominate, small components (ex5's single pixels?); potential overlaps resolved by priority (fixed first, then moving); all pixels must be placed within bounds without wrapping.
 * General: Preserve exact pixel counts per color/component; output must match exactly, including background fills; subtle mismatches like shifted positions (e.g., ex1 generated left-col 4's vs. expected right-col) indicate wrong fixed/moving criteria.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, deque

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color as the most frequent value."""
    n = len(g)
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This works well for all examples, as background is indeed the mode.)

```python
def get_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    """Find connected components (4-connected) for non-background pixels, grouped by color."""
    n = len(g)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    components = {}  # color -> list of components, each component list of (r, c)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                if color not in components:
                    components[color] = []
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components[color].append(component)
    result = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            result.append((color, comp))
    return result
```
(This is essential and correct: accurately extracts 4-connected same-color blobs, handling multiple per color; useful for all steps.)

```python
def get_bbox(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Compute bounding box: min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c."""
    rows = [r for r, c in component]
    cols = [c for r, c in component]
    return min(rows), max(rows), min(cols), max(cols)
```
(Helpful for analyzing positions, e.g., to check border touches for fixed/moving.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background and extracts components but fails on fixed/moving classification and transformations, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * is_fixed function is broken: uses min_r <=2 (top-touching) or max_c >=n-2 (right-touching), but in ex1, left-top 4's are generated as fixed (stay left) while expected moves them right; ex2 keeps left structures fixed but expected relocates to center-right; doesn't match subtle border rules (likely top/right fixed, left/bottom moving).
 * transform_moving is unhelpful and incorrect: simplifies to vertical stack in col0 from row0, capping at n pixels (causes loss/truncation, e.g., ex2's long 2 component shortened?); ignores shape preservation, rotation, or right/bottom placement (e.g., ex1 expected vertical on col4-5 with attachments, not col0).
 * keep_fixed is fine but unused effectively due to wrong classification.
 * place_pixels is helpful but overwrites without priority (fixed first needed); causes overlaps or empty spaces in generated (e.g., ex1 has 4/2/8 scattered left vs. expected clustered right).
 * Train 1: Generated keeps 4 vertical left (rows0-5 col0), 2 at row1 col5 (unmoved?), 8 at row3-6 col5; expected moves 4 to col4 rows1-4/col5 row0, 2 at row1 col5 (partial match but shifted), 8 vertical col5 rows3-6 (shape preserved but 4 moved wrong).
 * Train 2: Generated stacks 2/4 vertical left cols0-1, fills rest with 7; expected diagonal-ish placement: 4 horizontal-ish top col4, 3 vertical col3-4 mid, 2 vertical col7 bottom; total mismatch in positions/shapes.
 * Train 3: Generated keeps 9/2 vertical left-top, 7 scattered; expected moves 9/7/2 to bottom-right cluster (rows7-15 cols6-10), 2 vertical col6 rows0-6; ignores vertical extension and relocation.
 * Train 4: Generated keeps 5 vertical left, 3 at row1-2 col2-3? but flattened; expected rotates/shifts 8/3 to top-right L-shape cols2-3 rows0-3, 5 vertical col4 bottom rows4-9; shape and position wrong.
 * Train 5: Generated keeps 6/3 vertical left; expected shifts 9/3 to top-mid cols2-3 rows0-4, 6 vertical col5 bottom rows5-8; again, left-placement vs. right/bottom.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates component extraction but no understanding of movement rules (e.g., why left-to-right shift?); unhelpful functions like transform_moving should be discarded/replaced with shape-preserving shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it places components (colors 1,3,8,9 on background 5) as vertical stacks mostly in col0-1 top-to-mid (1 rows0-3 col0, 8 rows1-4 col1-2?, 3 rows4-6 col0, 9 rows7-8 col0), filling rest with 5's, resembling the flawed left-top stacking from training.
 * This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should relocate moving components to right/bottom, preserving shapes like diagonals or attachments, not flattening left); for 22x22 grid with colors 1/3/5/8/9, likely expects clustered right/bottom (e.g., 1 fixed top-left?, 8/3 mid-right, 9 bottom), but generated ignores scale and places everything left, causing sparse/wrong layout.
 * No shape preservation (e.g., if input has extended 1's or 5's as background? wait, 5 is bg here); overlaps none but positions all wrong, similar to train failures—does not account for border-touching fixed (e.g., top row 1's might be fixed, but 8/3/9 moved right/down).

[2025-10-02 01:58:14] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 02:04:20] Response:
- Fixed structure components (characterized by vertical or horizontal bars, often with pixels >=1, colors including Red, Green, Maroon, Pink, Orange, Light Blue in some cases, e.g., vertical bars or positioned singles) interact with filler components via position (bbox coordinates): fixed structures dictate adjacent placement for transformed fillers, resulting in shared edges or proximity in the output grid.
- Filler components (multi-pixel or single-pixel shapes, colors including Yellow, Light Blue, Maroon, Green, Dark Red; properties like polyomino configurations or bbox spanning multiple rows/columns) interact with fixed structures via position -> position transformation: fillers relocate to bbox positions immediately adjacent (left, above, or below) to fixed structures' bbox, consistently observed as new or altered components touching fixed ones.
- Same-color components within filler groups interact via shape properties (pixels count, bbox dimensions): fillers split (e.g., pixels=5 -> pixels=3+1+1) or reshape (e.g., horizontal bbox to vertical) before repositioning adjacent to fixed structures, with total pixels approximately conserved per color but not always exact.
- Color -> movement role: Filler colors (Yellow, Light Blue, Maroon, Dark Red, Green) consistently transform position/ shape, while structure colors (Red, Green, Pink, Orange, Maroon) remain unchanged in bbox and pixels; this role assignment affects which components move relative to others.
- Position (initial high min_y or max_y, indicating bottom placement) -> transformation (new bbox): Bottom-positioned fillers consistently relocate (unknown direction: up in non-container cases, down in container cases), but always to adjacency with fixed structures; transformation details (e.g., up vs. down) unknown without container presence.

No other obvious interactions (e.g., holes -> color, specific silhouettes -> movement, color -> color direct effect) are consistent across every train example, as holes only appear in subsets (train 2,3) and do not uniformly affect all components. Irrelevant elements like isolated non-transforming singles without adjacency changes are excluded.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- Fixed structure components (characterized by vertical or horizontal bars, often with pixels >=1, colors including Red, Green, Maroon, Pink, Orange, Light Blue in some cases, e.g., vertical bars or positioned singles) interact with filler components via position (bbox coordinates): fixed structures dictate adjacent placement for transformed fillers, resulting in shared edges or proximity in the output grid.
- Filler components (multi-pixel or single-pixel shapes, colors including Yellow, Light Blue, Maroon, Green, Dark Red; properties like polyomino configurations or bbox spanning multiple rows/columns) interact with fixed structures via position -> position transformation: fillers relocate to bbox positions immediately adjacent (left, above, or below) to fixed structures' bbox, consistently observed as new or altered components touching fixed ones.
- Same-color components within filler groups interact via shape properties (pixels count, bbox dimensions): fillers split (e.g., pixels=5 -> pixels=3+1+1) or reshape (e.g., horizontal bbox to vertical) before repositioning adjacent to fixed structures, with total pixels approximately conserved per color but not always exact.
- Color -> movement role: Filler colors (Yellow, Light Blue, Maroon, Dark Red, Green) consistently transform position/ shape, while structure colors (Red, Green, Pink, Orange, Maroon) remain unchanged in bbox and pixels; this role assignment affects which components move relative to others.
- Position (initial high min_y or max_y, indicating bottom placement) -> transformation (new bbox): Bottom-positioned fillers consistently relocate (unknown direction: up in non-container cases, down in container cases), but always to adjacency with fixed structures; transformation details (e.g., up vs. down) unknown without container presence.

No other obvious interactions (e.g., holes -> color, specific silhouettes -> movement, color -> color direct effect) are consistent across every train example, as holes only appear in subsets (train 2,3) and do not uniformly affect all components. Irrelevant elements like isolated non-transforming singles without adjacency changes are excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:27:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers) on a background, where the goal is to detect and erase "invalid" large connected components that aren't simple bars (straight horizontal or vertical lines), then restore the exact number of erased pixels for each affected color by placing them in strategic positions to connect, extend, or bridge between remaining "fixed" components, effectively completing or correcting incomplete shapes while preserving bars and small components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color; all other colors are potential shapes/objects.
 * Connected components use 8-connectivity (including diagonals), so shapes can be diagonally adjacent.
 * "Bars" are strictly contiguous straight lines: either all in one column (vertical, consecutive rows) or one row (horizontal, consecutive columns); anything larger than 3 pixels that's not a bar gets fully erased.
 * Erased colors are restored exactly N pixels (original count), but only if there was at least one large non-bar component for that color; placement prioritizes sorted fixed components (by min row), focusing on upper/lower pairs.
 * Bridging logic: Calculate delta_r (row gap) and delta_c (column shift) between upper component's bottom and lower component's top; use linear interpolation (round(k * abs(delta_c) / delta_r)) for slanted bridges; handle cases where upper_num <= lower_num (left-attach + upper extension) vs. else (lower vertical extension + mirror).
 * If no bridge needed (delta_r <=0) or <2 fixed components, fallback to simple vertical placement (e.g., left/right of a single component).
 * Filler colors are sorted by value for ordered placement; candidates are sets to avoid duplicates, sorted by (row, col) for sequential filling.
 * Subtle edge cases: Handle out-of-bounds, already-filled cells (skip if not bg), rounding in averages/positions, sign of delta_c for direction, and when bridge_col is offset (e.g., -1). No placement if no candidates or N=0.
 * Grids can be rectangular (rows x cols), but examples are square-ish; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Potential misses: Over-erasing if components are misidentified as non-bars; incorrect bridge slopes if delta_r=0 or small; ignoring small components (<4 pixels) which stay fixed; not handling multiple upper/lower pairs or non-vertical gaps well; placement might overlap or skip due to sorting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [g[i][j] for i in range(len(g)) for j in range(len(g[0]))]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Identifies bg reliably via mode.)

```python
def get_non_background_colors(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> set:
    colors = set()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != bg:
                colors.add(cell)
    return colors
```
(Simple set of unique non-bg colors.)

```python
def get_all_positions(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    positions = []
    rows_n = len(g)
    cols_n = len(g[0])
    for i in range(rows_n):
        for j in range(cols_n):
            if g[i][j] == color:
                positions.append((i, j))
    return positions
```
(Collects all positions of a color for counting N.)

```python
def is_vertical_bar(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    if not positions:
        return False
    cols = {j for i, j in positions}
    if len(cols) != 1:
        return False
    col = next(iter(cols))
    rows = sorted(i for i, j in positions)
    if len(rows) != len(positions):
        return False
    for k in range(1, len(rows)):
        if rows[k] != rows[k - 1] + 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_horizontal_bar(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    if not positions:
        return False
    rows = {i for i, j in positions}
    if len(rows) != 1:
        return False
    row = next(iter(rows))
    cols = sorted(j for i, j in positions)
    if len(cols) != len(positions):
        return False
    for k in range(1, len(cols)):

def is_bar(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles background detection, component extraction, bar identification, and erasure of large non-bars, as shown by passing training examples 1, 3, and 5.
 * It demonstrates core bridging logic for connecting upper/lower components, including slanted interpolation and conditional extensions/attachments based on component sizes.
 * However, in training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated output places a vertical stack of 3's in column 3 (rows 0-3) and keeps 4's misplaced, while expected has 4 at row0 col4, 3's horizontal in rows1-2 cols3-4, and a 3 at row5 col6 before the 2's bar; the generated ignores the need for horizontal shaping and bridge adjustment, resulting in vertical over-placement (effect: extra 3's in top-left, missing horizontal extension for 3/4 and the row5 3).
 * In training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated keeps 8's vertical in column 1 (rows1-4,6-7?) but places 3's incorrectly, while expected has 8's more spread (row0 col3, row1 col2, row2 col1, row3 col2, row4 col3) forming a diagonal-ish shape, with 3's adjusted; effect: generated fails to bridge/extend 8's properly across the gap to connect to 5's, keeping them too vertical and clustered left (missing the zigzag or slanted restoration).
 * The fallback placement (for <2 components) works in simple cases but over-relies on vertical stacking, which mismatches expected horizontal or offset placements in examples 2 and 4.
 * Sorting fixed_comps by min row is helpful for upper/lower pairing but misses multi-pair or horizontal-dominant scenes.
 * Bridge calculation with round(sum/len) for averages is good for centers but can misalign if components are asymmetric (e.g., in ex4, 8's need more diagonal shift).
 * Candidate set union (attach + bridge + ext) avoids overlaps, but sorting by (row,col) may prioritize top-left too aggressively, filling wrong spots first.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the complex conditional logic in placement (e.g., do_left_attach, mirror_num) is brittle and overfits vertical bridges, failing slanted/horizontal needs in failed examples.
 * Overall, erasure and counting N work well (preserves pixel totals), but placement candidates are insufficiently flexible for non-vertical gaps or when delta_c is large.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules inferred from training; it erases and restores some elements (e.g., 3's bar in row8 cols0-6, vertical 4's descending from row9 col4 to row15 col7, then 8's/6/1's in lower right), but the slanted progression of 4's and isolated 6 at row18 col7 suggest incomplete bridging—likely meant to connect a upper shape (possibly the 3's) to lower ones (1's?), but the 8's at row16-17 col7-8 and single 6 seem like a failed interpolation (effect: abrupt 6 instead of smooth slant, and 1's vertical in col8 without attachment to above).
 * Compared to training failures, this mirrors ex4's issue: vertical bias in placement (4's stack down-right) instead of expected diagonal/horizontal restoration to match shape continuity; the all-5 top (rows0-7) implies heavy erasure, but restoration starts too late/low, missing potential upper extensions.
 * Without explicit expected, it partially makes sense (total pixels per color likely match N), but the disjoint lower elements (6/8/1) indicate missed subtle diagonal connectivity or mirror extension, making it incorrect for a complete shape.

[2025-10-02 02:27:28] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components Across All Train Examples

Based on analysis of the 5 train input/output pairs, below is a list of **only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed in **every** example. These are limited to properties or components where the interaction (e.g., effect on position, shape, holes, or color preservation) is identical across all 5 trains. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced connections are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated pieces with no transformation or relation to others) are excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., color-specific changes that don't occur in all trains, variable hole modifications, or non-universal repositioning rules) are noted as unknown where applicable. Pixel counts are treated as approximate due to minor discrepancies (1-2 pixels) in some cases, but conservation is considered only where exact and universal.

#### 1. **Unchanged Elements (Stable Components)**
   - **Description**: In every train, a subset of elements remains completely identical between input and output: same color, same hole count (always 0), same bounding box (bbox), and same pixel count. These elements do not transform, move, or interact detectably with other components—they are preserved as-is.
   - **Interconnected Property**: Position stability → no transformation. These elements' positions (often on the periphery, e.g., right edge or bottom, but exact rule unknown) prevent any effect from the overall reconfiguration.
   - **Examples Across All Trains** (one or more per train, always present):
     - Train 1: Red (holes=0, bbox=[5,1,5,1], pixels=1); Maroon (holes=0, bbox=[5,3,5,6], pixels=4).
     - Train 2: Yellow (holes=0, bbox=[4,0,4,2], pixels=3); Green (holes=0, bbox=[6,5,6,5], pixels=1); Red (holes=0, bbox=[7,5,7,11], pixels=7).
     - Train 3: Red (holes=0, bbox=[6,0,6,6], pixels=7); Dark Red (holes=0, bbox=[7,6,7,6], pixels=1); Light Blue (holes=0, bbox=[9,9,9,11], pixels=3).
     - Train 4: Green (holes=0, bbox=[3,1,3,1], pixels=1); Green (holes=0, bbox=[2,2,2,2], pixels=1); Green (holes=0, bbox=[3,3,3,3], pixels=1); Orange (holes=0, bbox=[4,4,4,9], pixels=6).
     - Train 5: Green (holes=0, bbox=[3,2,3,3], pixels=2); Pink (holes=0, bbox=[5,5,5,8], pixels=4).
   - **Consistency Note**: Always involves elements with holes=0 and small-to-medium pixel counts (1-7). No color is universal (e.g., Red in 1-3, Green in 2/4/5), but the preservation effect is identical in all. These do not affect or connect to transformed elements.

#### 2. **Disassembly of Non-Stable Elements into Smaller Same-Color Components**
   - **Description**: In every train, non-stable elements (those not preserved as above) are consistently disassembled into multiple smaller components of the **same color**. The smaller components have holes=0, reduced pixel counts per piece (often 1-3 pixels each), and new bboxes. Total pixels per color are conserved (or off by ≤2, possibly due to background absorption—unknown). This affects shape properties (e.g., from connected bars/L-shapes to scattered bars/monominoes).
   - **Interconnected Property**: Shape connectivity (e.g., multi-pixel connected regions in input) → disassembly into disconnected smaller pieces. Position in input (non-peripheral) effects transformation to new positions in output (often shifting toward top-left or along edges, but exact mapping unknown). No color change, but hole count resets to 0.
   - **Examples Across All Trains** (always involves 1+ colors per train):
     - Train 1: Yellow input (two pieces, total pixels=6, bboxes=[2,3,4,5] & [1,6,1,6]) → disassembled to two Yellow pieces (total pixels≈4, bboxes=[5,0,5,0] & [4,1,4,3]).
     - Train 2: Green input (three pieces, total pixels=5, various bboxes) → disassembled to four Green pieces (total pixels=5, bboxes=[3,1,3,2], [4,3,4,3], [5,4,5,4], [6,5,6,5]); Dark Red input (one piece, holes=2, pixels=129, bbox=[0,0,11,11]) → disassembled to two Dark Red pieces (holes=0 each, total pixels=129, bboxes=[5,0,11,11] & [0,0,6,11]).
     - Train 3: Dark Red input (three pieces, total pixels=9, bboxes=[11,2,13,4], [8,5,10,5], [7,6,7,6]) → disassembled to seven Dark Red pieces (total pixels=9, various small bboxes like [8,7,8,7], [9,8,9,8], etc.).
     - Train 4: Maroon input (two pieces, total pixels=6, bboxes=[3,4,3,5] & [1,6,2,8]) → disassembled to five Maroon pieces (total pixels≈5, all pixels=1, bboxes like [3,0,3,0], [2,1,2,1], etc.).
     - Train 5: Light Blue input (three pieces, total pixels=6, bboxes=[4,5,4,5], [3,6,3,6], [0,7,2,8]) → disassembled to five Light Blue pieces (total pixels=6, bboxes like [4,0,4,0], [3,1,3,1], [2,2,2,3], etc.).
   - **Consistency Note**: Always same-color output pieces; always reduces connectivity (e.g., input multi-pixel shapes → output small/disconnected). No interaction with other colors observed. Applies only to non-stable elements; rule for which elements disassemble (e.g., based on input position or adjacency—unknown) is not obvious.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Connections
- **Hole Count Interactions**: When present (trains 2-3), input elements with holes>0 consistently result in output pieces with holes=0 (e.g., splitting resets holes), but hole count changes on large shapes vary (e.g., +1 in train 3 for Blue; split in train 2 for Dark Red). Not present or consistent in trains 1/4/5 (all holes=0), so not universal.
- **Position → Color Effects**: No consistent color changes based on position across all (e.g., no universal "position X → color Y" mapping; colors stay the same in transformations).
- **Background/Overlay Effects**: General description suggests background color shift (black → orange) with overlaid elements, but data shows no explicit background component. Possible interaction with disassembled pieces (e.g., pixel loss ≈1-2 in trains 1/4 may relate to overlay absorption), but unconfirmable and not in every train's data.
- **Shape Silhouette/Edge Effects**: Input shapes with extended bboxes (e.g., wide or tall) consistently disassemble, but no universal edge/hole/silhouette property (e.g., "L-shape → hook") affects movement across all—specific transformations unknown.
- **Inter-Element Connections**: No consistent adjacency or overlap between specific elements (e.g., Yellow → Green) in every train; disassembled pieces do not visibly reconnect to unchanged ones.

No other obvious, universal interactions (e.g., consistent color-to-color effects, position-to-hole mappings, or silhouette transformations) are identifiable without forcing unrelated patterns.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components Across All Train Examples

Based on analysis of the 5 train input/output pairs, below is a list of **only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed in **every** example. These are limited to properties or components where the interaction (e.g., effect on position, shape, holes, or color preservation) is identical across all 5 trains. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced connections are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated pieces with no transformation or relation to others) are excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., color-specific changes that don't occur in all trains, variable hole modifications, or non-universal repositioning rules) are noted as unknown where applicable. Pixel counts are treated as approximate due to minor discrepancies (1-2 pixels) in some cases, but conservation is considered only where exact and universal.

#### 1. **Unchanged Elements (Stable Components)**
   - **Description**: In every train, a subset of elements remains completely identical between input and output: same color, same hole count (always 0), same bounding box (bbox), and same pixel count. These elements do not transform, move, or interact detectably with other components—they are preserved as-is.
   - **Interconnected Property**: Position stability → no transformation. These elements' positions (often on the periphery, e.g., right edge or bottom, but exact rule unknown) prevent any effect from the overall reconfiguration.
   - **Examples Across All Trains** (one or more per train, always present):
     - Train 1: Red (holes=0, bbox=[5,1,5,1], pixels=1); Maroon (holes=0, bbox=[5,3,5,6], pixels=4).
     - Train 2: Yellow (holes=0, bbox=[4,0,4,2], pixels=3); Green (holes=0, bbox=[6,5,6,5], pixels=1); Red (holes=0, bbox=[7,5,7,11], pixels=7).
     - Train 3: Red (holes=0, bbox=[6,0,6,6], pixels=7); Dark Red (holes=0, bbox=[7,6,7,6], pixels=1); Light Blue (holes=0, bbox=[9,9,9,11], pixels=3).
     - Train 4: Green (holes=0, bbox=[3,1,3,1], pixels=1); Green (holes=0, bbox=[2,2,2,2], pixels=1); Green (holes=0, bbox=[3,3,3,3], pixels=1); Orange (holes=0, bbox=[4,4,4,9], pixels=6).
     - Train 5: Green (holes=0, bbox=[3,2,3,3], pixels=2); Pink (holes=0, bbox=[5,5,5,8], pixels=4).
   - **Consistency Note**: Always involves elements with holes=0 and small-to-medium pixel counts (1-7). No color is universal (e.g., Red in 1-3, Green in 2/4/5), but the preservation effect is identical in all. These do not affect or connect to transformed elements.

#### 2. **Disassembly of Non-Stable Elements into Smaller Same-Color Components**
   - **Description**: In every train, non-stable elements (those not preserved as above) are consistently disassembled into multiple smaller components of the **same color**. The smaller components have holes=0, reduced pixel counts per piece (often 1-3 pixels each), and new bboxes. Total pixels per color are conserved (or off by ≤2, possibly due to background absorption—unknown). This affects shape properties (e.g., from connected bars/L-shapes to scattered bars/monominoes).
   - **Interconnected Property**: Shape connectivity (e.g., multi-pixel connected regions in input) → disassembly into disconnected smaller pieces. Position in input (non-peripheral) effects transformation to new positions in output (often shifting toward top-left or along edges, but exact mapping unknown). No color change, but hole count resets to 0.
   - **Examples Across All Trains** (always involves 1+ colors per train):
     - Train 1: Yellow input (two pieces, total pixels=6, bboxes=[2,3,4,5] & [1,6,1,6]) → disassembled to two Yellow pieces (total pixels≈4, bboxes=[5,0,5,0] & [4,1,4,3]).
     - Train 2: Green input (three pieces, total pixels=5, various bboxes) → disassembled to four Green pieces (total pixels=5, bboxes=[3,1,3,2], [4,3,4,3], [5,4,5,4], [6,5,6,5]); Dark Red input (one piece, holes=2, pixels=129, bbox=[0,0,11,11]) → disassembled to two Dark Red pieces (holes=0 each, total pixels=129, bboxes=[5,0,11,11] & [0,0,6,11]).
     - Train 3: Dark Red input (three pieces, total pixels=9, bboxes=[11,2,13,4], [8,5,10,5], [7,6,7,6]) → disassembled to seven Dark Red pieces (total pixels=9, various small bboxes like [8,7,8,7], [9,8,9,8], etc.).
     - Train 4: Maroon input (two pieces, total pixels=6, bboxes=[3,4,3,5] & [1,6,2,8]) → disassembled to five Maroon pieces (total pixels≈5, all pixels=1, bboxes like [3,0,3,0], [2,1,2,1], etc.).
     - Train 5: Light Blue input (three pieces, total pixels=6, bboxes=[4,5,4,5], [3,6,3,6], [0,7,2,8]) → disassembled to five Light Blue pieces (total pixels=6, bboxes like [4,0,4,0], [3,1,3,1], [2,2,2,3], etc.).
   - **Consistency Note**: Always same-color output pieces; always reduces connectivity (e.g., input multi-pixel shapes → output small/disconnected). No interaction with other colors observed. Applies only to non-stable elements; rule for which elements disassemble (e.g., based on input position or adjacency—unknown) is not obvious.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Connections
- **Hole Count Interactions**: When present (trains 2-3), input elements with holes>0 consistently result in output pieces with holes=0 (e.g., splitting resets holes), but hole count changes on large shapes vary (e.g., +1 in train 3 for Blue; split in train 2 for Dark Red). Not present or consistent in trains 1/4/5 (all holes=0), so not universal.
- **Position → Color Effects**: No consistent color changes based on position across all (e.g., no universal "position X → color Y" mapping; colors stay the same in transformations).
- **Background/Overlay Effects**: General description suggests background color shift (black → orange) with overlaid elements, but data shows no explicit background component. Possible interaction with disassembled pieces (e.g., pixel loss ≈1-2 in trains 1/4 may relate to overlay absorption), but unconfirmable and not in every train's data.
- **Shape Silhouette/Edge Effects**: Input shapes with extended bboxes (e.g., wide or tall) consistently disassemble, but no universal edge/hole/silhouette property (e.g., "L-shape → hook") affects movement across all—specific transformations unknown.
- **Inter-Element Connections**: No consistent adjacency or overlap between specific elements (e.g., Yellow → Green) in every train; disassembled pieces do not visibly reconnect to unchanged ones.

No other obvious, universal interactions (e.g., consistent color-to-color effects, position-to-hole mappings, or silhouette transformations) are identifiable without forcing unrelated patterns.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:44:18] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the background color (most frequent) is identified, connected components of non-background colors are extracted, "stable" components (strictly vertical lines without gaps) are preserved in place, and non-stable components (any non-vertical or gapped shapes) are repositioned or redistributed in a structured way to form new vertical alignments, possibly simulating sorting, falling, or stacking while conserving pixel counts per color. The goal is to produce a cleaned-up grid with vertical color stacks in specific columns, often shifting non-vertical blobs to form coherent vertical lines in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color overall, used to fill erased areas; non-background colors form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Stable components are purely vertical: same column, consecutive rows with no gaps (e.g., a straight line from min_row to max_row with exactly max-min+1 cells); any horizontal spread, gaps, or non-straight alignment disqualifies the entire color's components for stability.
 * For stable colors, all components must be vertical to keep the color; if any component for a color is non-vertical, the entire color is treated as unstable and repositioned (not just the bad component).
 * Non-stable colors' pixels are collected entirely (all instances of that color), and their count must be conserved approximately, but repositioned into new vertical stacks, often in dedicated columns, starting from the bottom or in a sequence that matches the original "order" or shape projection.
 * Repositioning non-stables: Not random or diagonal; instead, they seem to "fall" or stack vertically in new columns (e.g., shifting left/right to empty columns, forming L-shapes or diagonals turned vertical), preserving relative ordering of colors from the input (e.g., top-to-bottom or left-to-right scan).
 * Subtle: Outputs often have non-stables forming partial verticals or connected shapes that mimic input blobs but aligned vertically; background fills everything else. Pixel counts per color are exactly preserved. Grids are square (n x n), but components can span partial heights.
 * Edge cases: Single-pixel or short verticals are stable if straight; multi-component colors are stable only if all are vertical. No 8-connectivity—strictly 4. Overwriting only on background; no merging of colors.
 * Conservation: Total pixels per color unchanged, but positions shifted to avoid overlaps and fill from specific starting points (e.g., bottom-up in columns).
 * Common misses: Treating partial verticals as stable when gapped; placing non-stables sequentially without regard to original shape/orientation; failing to shift entire blobs as units rather than scattering pixels.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core issues in repositioning non-stable components.
 * Train 1: Generated placed 4's horizontally in row 0 and scattered 2/8 vertically wrong; expected has 4's shifted to col4 rows1-3 + col5 row0, 2 at row1 col5, 8's vertical in col5 from row3 down—generated ignored original positions for stables and used diagonal for non-stables, mismatching vertical stacking and column choices (unknown why diagonal was chosen, but it scattered instead of stacking).
 * Train 2: Generated kept some 7's but placed 3's/4's horizontally in row0 and vertical 2's in col7; expected has 4's vertical in col4 rows0-2, 3's diagonal-to-vertical in col3-4 rows1-5, 2's vertical in col7 from row5 down—generated treated 3/4 as non-stable and diagonal-placed, losing the partial-diagonal preservation turned vertical.
 * Train 3: Generated placed 2's vertical in col6 rows0-6, 1's scattered with 9's vertical in col9; expected keeps 2's vertical in col6 rows0-6 (correctly stable), but shifts 7's/9's into a connected vertical/diagonal stack starting row6 col7 downward and rightward—generated kept stables but diagonal-placed non-stables (7/9?) in wrong columns, breaking the connected shape.
 * Train 4: Generated placed 8's horizontal in row0, 3's scattered vertical in col2, 5's vertical in col4; expected has 8/3 forming a diagonal snake turned into verticals in cols 1-3 rows1-3, 5's vertical in col4 from row4 down—generated scattered 8/3 as non-stables on diagonal instead of preserving blob connectivity as vertical stack.
 * Train 5: Generated 9's horizontal row0, 3's vertical col3 rows2-3, 6's vertical col5 rows5-8; expected 9/3 as diagonal verticalized in cols2-3 rows0-4, 6's vertical col5 rows6-8—similar scattering issue, diagonal placement overwrote wrong positions without forming original blob's vertical projection.
 * Function `place_non_stable_as_diagonal` is broken/not helpful: It sequentially fills from top-left diagonal, ignoring original shapes/columns, leading to horizontal spreads and wrong counts/placements; do not use in future—replace with vertical stacking in shifted columns.
 * `keep_stable_components` works partially (preserves true verticals like 2's in train3, 6's/5's in trains4-5) but fails when non-stables overwrite or when partial verticals are misclassified.
 * `find_components` and `is_vertical_component` are essential and correct for extraction/stability check.
 * Overall: Stable detection works for clear verticals but repositioning fails entirely—non-stables need to be reformed as vertical stacks in sequential empty columns (e.g., left-to-right), preserving pixel order from input scan (row-major) or blob centroids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows massive horizontal spreads of 8's/9's/3's/4's/5's in row0-1, then huge vertical blocks of 5's filling most of the grid (rows2-17), with 6/1 scattered at bottom— this appears as over-placement of 5's (likely background or dominant non-stable flooded wrongly) and ignores vertical stacking, resulting in a mostly uniform 5-block with misplaced singles, unlike expected patterns in training (compact vertical color stacks in specific columns without flooding). It scatters non-stables horizontally/diagonally per the flawed function, losing all shape preservation; does not make sense as it violates pixel conservation per color (5's dominate unnaturally) and fails to form coherent verticals—must account for sequential column assignment for non-stables (e.g., place each color's pixels vertically in next available column from bottom, preserving input order) to handle large/complex tests.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 02:44:36] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- Black background with yellow staircase polyomino (ascending from bottom-left), adjacent purple vertical bar (right side), and isolated red square (top-right).

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 5 train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties that appear in **EVERY** train example. I focused solely on patterns that hold true across all 5 cases without exception, ignoring any non-consistent or speculative changes (e.g., pixel count variations, hole changes, or color-specific behaviors that don't occur universally). No high-level puzzle solving or total understanding is implied or attempted. Connections are limited to those directly observable in property transformations (e.g., position, color persistence) between input and output. If a potential interaction could not be confirmed as consistent and explainable across all examples (e.g., specific color-to-hole effects or directional movement biases), it is called out as unknown rather than forced.

- **Position affects shape persistence or replication for same-color components**: In every train example, components of the same color that share overlapping or adjacent y-coordinate ranges in their bounding boxes (bbox) in the input result in output components of the same color that either persist unchanged or replicate/split into multiple instances with adjusted bbox positions (e.g., shifted x/y within the original range). Isolated same-color components (no shared y-range adjacency) always persist unchanged. This interaction does not alter color or holes but consistently transforms position to maintain or expand presence within the shared y-space. Examples: Train 1 (Yellow components at y3-6 adjust to y0-3); Train 2 (Green at y5-8 adjust/replicate to y1-5); Train 3 (Dark Red at y2-6 adjust/replicate to y6-14); Train 4 (Green/Maroon at y1-5 adjust/replicate to y0-4); Train 5 (Light Blue at y5-8 adjust/replicate to y0-5).

- **Color persistence linked to bbox adjacency**: Across all examples, any two or more components whose bbox min_x or max_x values are within 1 unit (indicating horizontal adjacency or overlap potential) in the input will produce output components of matching colors that retain the exact same bbox if unchanged, or transform only the adjacent one's position while preserving the other's. Non-adjacent components (x-difference >1) never affect each other and remain identical. This is a direct position-to-persistence interaction, with no color change. Examples: Train 1 (Yellow at x2-4 adjacent to Maroon/Red at x5; Maroon/Red persist, Yellow position shifts); Train 2 (Greens at x3-6 adjacent; they replicate positions, Dark Red isolated splits independently); Train 3 (Dark Reds at x7-13 adjacent to Blue bbox x0-16; Dark Reds positions shift, Blue bbox persists); Train 4 (Greens/Maroons at x1-3 adjacent; they interleave positions, Orange at x4 isolated persists); Train 5 (Light Blues at x0-4 adjacent to Green/Pink at x3-5; Light Blues shift positions, Green/Pink persist).

- **Unknown: Hole count to position transformation**: Hole properties (when present) consistently interact with position changes in outputs (e.g., components with holes>0 always have bbox y-ranges expanded or shifted), but the direction or mechanism of this effect varies (e.g., splitting in Train 2 vs. single-component expansion in Train 3) and does not occur in hole-free examples (Trains 1, 4, 5), so no universal explanation can be identified without forcing inconsistency.

No other interactions (e.g., pixel count to color, specific shape silhouettes to movement, or vertical position biases) were consistent across every example, as they either varied in direction/mechanism or only appeared in subsets of trains. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., fully isolated components with no bbox adjacency to others) were excluded, as they show no transformation or effect in any example.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 02:47:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where a background value (most common number) represents empty space, and non-background tiles appear to "fall" or move downward in columns while possibly preserving some horizontal structure or connections, resulting in stacked formations at the bottom of specific columns rather than uniform sliding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Non-background tiles move vertically downward (gravity-like) within their columns, stacking from the bottom up, but horizontal positions are not simply slid left/right—tiles seem to maintain or shift to form vertical stacks in columns where they originated or connected.
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent value, but movement is per-column downward, not row-wise sliding; the previous attempt reversed this by sliding right (horizontal) then up (opposite of gravity).
 * Tiles do not merge or combine values (e.g., no 2048-style addition); they retain their numbers and positions relative to each other in a way that suggests independent column processing after possible horizontal alignment.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but examples vary in size (e.g., 7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); ensure code handles variable n without assuming fixed size.
 * Subtle: In expected outputs, some tiles appear to "float" or shift horizontally slightly before falling (e.g., in training 1, the 4's align in column 4 before falling, and 8's stack in column 5); this may indicate pre-processing like left-alignment per row or object detection for connected groups.
 * Easy to miss: Not all non-background tiles fall uniformly—some examples show partial stacks (e.g., training 3 has a vertical line of 2's in column 6 across top rows, then branching to 7 and 9 in lower rows), suggesting possible rotation, connection-based movement, or multi-step processing (horizontal then vertical).
 * No overwriting or merging occurs; empty spaces fill with background only after movement.
 * Consider connected components: Tiles might form "objects" that fall as units, explaining why shapes are preserved (e.g., in training 4, the 8-3 pair shifts down while rotating or aligning).
 * Process columns independently for vertical movement, but rows may need initial left-packing or no horizontal move at all—previous right-slide disrupted this.
 * Edge case: If all tiles are background, return unchanged; if no non-background, no movement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""
    if not g:
        return 0  # Default if empty
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fall_down_column(col: List[int], background: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Move non-background tiles down in a column, stacking from bottom."""
    non_bg = [x for x in col if x != background]
    new_col = [background] * n
    # Stack from bottom: place non_bg in reverse order from bottom up
    for idx in range(len(non_bg)):
        new_col[n - 1 - idx] = non_bg[-1 - idx]  # Preserve original top-to-bottom order
    return new_col
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used row-wise right-sliding followed by column-wise up-bubbling, which clumped all non-background tiles to the top-right, inverting the expected downward gravity and disrupting horizontal structures.
 * Worked: Correctly identified background via Counter; copied grid to avoid mutation; separated row and column operations.
 * Didn't work: Horizontal right-slide pushed tiles right unnecessarily (expected shows left or no horizontal shift); upward bubbling opposed gravity (expected stacks at bottom); treated all non-bg independently without preserving order or connections, leading to jumbled stacks (e.g., in training 1, generated has 4's and 2 mixed at top-right, expected has aligned 4's falling to mid-bottom in col4, 2 in col5, 8's stacking bottom in col5).
 * In training 1: Generated clumped to rows 0-5 top-right (e.g., row0 ends [4,4,2]), expected has sparse downward stacks (e.g., row1 [...,4,2,0], row3 [...,4,8,0], bottom rows stacked 8's in col5)—difference in direction and no horizontal push.
 * In training 2: Generated slid everything right then up, filling top rows with 7's and clumping 3,4,2 to right columns (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,4]), expected shows diagonal-like fall with 4/3 shifting left-down (e.g., row0 [...,4,7,...], row3 [...,3,7,...], 2 stacking bottom-right in col7)—horizontal left-alignment missing, upward wrong.
 * In training 3: Generated messed up vertical lines (e.g., row0 ends [2,2,7,2], row2 [...,7,7,7]), expected preserves top vertical 2's in col6, then branches 7 right-down to col7, 9 further right-down to col9 with 7 wrap—suggests object tracing or path-following, not simple slide; attempt ignored connections.
 * In training 4: Generated right-up clump (e.g., row0 [...,8,8,3], row3 [...,8,5]), expected shows rotation/shift down-left (e.g., row0 [...,8,0,...], row1 [...,8,3,0,...], row2 [8,3,0,...], then 8-5 fall to col3-4 bottom)—attempt's slide lost the pair's relative positions.
 * In training 5: Generated right-up (e.g., row0 [...,9,9,9,3], row2 [...,9,6]), expected down-left stacks (e.g., row0 [...,9,0,...], row2 [...,9,3,0,...], 9-6 fall to col4-5 bottom)—similar loss of horizontal structure.
 * Function `slide_right_row` is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle (pushes right, but expected often left or none; don't use).
 * Function `bubble_up_column` is wrong direction (up instead of down; reverse to fall_down for future).
 * No object extraction attempted, but may be needed for connected groups—consider adding to trace shapes before falling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (22x22 grid?) clumps non-background tiles (3,8,9,4,6,1) via right-slide then up-bubble, resulting in top-heavy fillings (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,8,8,8,9,8], row8 [...,6], bottom rows all 5's/background)—this looks incorrect as it inverts gravity and mixes tiles horizontally/vertically without structure.
 * Does not match training expected patterns: Expected likely has downward stacks in specific columns (e.g., 3/8/9 falling to bottom in leftish cols, preserving any pairs like 4-3 or 9-6), but generated has top-right mess (e.g., 3's and 9's scattered top, 6/1 low but not stacked bottom)—missing left-align and down-fall.
 * Test has more tiles (3,8x4,9x3,4x2,6,1) scattered initially; output ignores potential connections (e.g., clustered 8's/9's should stack as group bottom, not bubble up).
 * Overall, test output does not make sense—it's a top-right pile-up, while puzzle seems bottom-left/downward formation; update to column-down fall after possible left-row pack to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle simulating gravity on a grid where non-background cells (numbers) fall downward, but connected groups (blobs or "objects") of the same number must fall as rigid, intact units rather than scattering per cell or per column. The goal is to apply gravity such that these connected components drop as wholes until they stack on the bottom, other components, or the grid floor, while preserving their relative shapes and positions within the component.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent number (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 7 across examples), and only non-background cells move; background fills vacated spaces.
 * Connectivity is key: Use 4-connected (up/down/left/right, not diagonal) or possibly 8-connected groups of identical numbers as "objects" that fall rigidly together—do not break them into individual cells or columns.
 * Falling order matters: Components likely need to be processed from lowest to highest (bottom-up simulation) to avoid overlaps or premature stacking; simulate step-by-step drops (one row at a time per component) until no more movement is possible.
 * Stacking rules: When a component falls, it drops until any of its cells hits the bottom row, another stable component below, or background— the entire shape shifts down uniformly.
 * Subtleties: Components can interlock or stack in non-column-aligned ways (e.g., overhanging shapes); horizontal connections across columns must be preserved (e.g., rows of 4's fall as a bar, not splitting). No rotation or deformation—rigid drop only. Handle empty grids or all-background as no-op. Potential for multiple components of the same number to fall separately if not connected. Diagonal connections probably don't count (based on examples where shapes don't merge diagonally). In complex cases (e.g., train3), nested or L-shaped blobs form and fall without filling gaps internally.
 * Edge cases: Grids of varying sizes (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); components touching the bottom don't move; if components would overlap after falling, resolve by order (e.g., lower ones first).
 * All training examples failed because per-column falling ignores connectivity, causing shapes to distort (e.g., horizontal bars become vertical stacks).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `find_background` function is helpful and correct for identifying the background color via frequency count.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The provided `fall_down_column` function is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—it applies gravity per column independently, which splits connected components (do not reuse or adapt directly; it ignores horizontal/vertical bonds).

To solve, need new functions for connected components (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) and rigid falling simulation:

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """
    Returns list of (positions_list, value) for each 4-connected component of same non-bg value.
    Uses flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to identify rigid objects.
    """
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                value = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == value:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((component, value))
    return components
```

        can_drop = True
        new_positions = [(r + 1, c) for r, c in component]
        for r, c in new_positions:
            if r + 1 >= rows or g[r + 1][c] != background:

        component = new_positions  # Update for next check
    return g, drop_rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used per-column gravity, which worked for identifying background correctly (e.g., 0 in train1/4/5, 7 in train2, 1 in train3) and basic downward stacking in isolated columns, but failed entirely on preserving connected shapes—components split and reformed vertically, distorting blobs (e.g., horizontal groups of 4's or 8's became scattered vertical stacks).
 * Train1: Generated stacked 4's and 8's at bottom of cols independently, but expected shows a connected "L" or bar of 4's falling as a unit to mid-right, with 2 and 8 stacking adjacently without splitting; difference: generated has 4's duplicated/stacked wrong in col3/6, 2 misplaced high.
 * Train2: Generated per-column drop turned horizontal 3's/4's into verticals at bottom, with 2 isolated; expected keeps some horizontal structure and stacks 3's/4's as partial bars in cols3-5, with 2 at bottom col7—difference: generated has 3's only in bottom row col3, 4's split vertically in col4, ignoring connections.
 * Train3: Generated crammed everything to bottom rows with vertical stacks (e.g., 7's and 9's aligned in cols), but expected spreads shapes horizontally (e.g., 7's form an L-shape across rows7-16 in varying cols, 9's horizontal in cols9-10); difference: generated ignores blob shapes entirely, filling bottom uniformly; 2's stacked vertically in col6.
 * Train4: Generated vertical stacks of 3's/8's in cols2-4, 5's isolated in col4; expected rotates/stacks as connected: 8's and 3's form a snake-like drop across cols1-3, 5's vertical in col4—difference: generated has 8's horizontal at bottom row9 but 3's split, no overhanging.
 * Train5: Generated 9's horizontal at bottom row8, 3's vertical in col3, 6's vertical in col5; expected drops 9's as a connected blob wrapping around 3's and 6's (horizontal in row0 col4, vertical in col2 rows2-4, etc.)—difference: generated keeps 9's flat but positions 3 and 6 wrong, no wrapping connectivity.
 * `fall_down_column` is broken/not helpful—it's column-centric and doesn't handle cross-column connections (avoid in future; replace with component-based dropping).
 * No extraction of objects in attempt, which is essential for identifying rigid blobs—future attempts must include connected component detection to group cells properly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it applies the same flawed per-column gravity, resulting in mostly uniform 5's (background?) filling the grid, with mismatched blobs crammed to the bottom rows (e.g., 8's/3's/4's/9's stacked vertically in cols2-13 row20-21, 1/6 isolated). This ignores connectivity, turning what should be rigid shapes (e.g., horizontal 8's in row19, clustered 3's/4's in row20, 9's in row20) into disconnected vertical piles, similar to training failures. It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected output should preserve blob shapes (e.g., horizontal bars of 4's or 9's dropping as units, possibly interlocking with 8's or 3's without splitting). Without the exact expected test output, it's unclear on precise stacking, but the uniform bottom-filling and shape distortion confirm it's wrong—likely needs component extraction to handle the clustered non-5's (1,3,4,6,8,9) as falling objects.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 2D grid where non-background cells (representing objects or particles of different types/numbers) are subject to gravity, causing them to fall downward toward the bottom of the grid until they reach a stable position. The simulation must account for objects potentially sliding left or right (or diagonally) to settle into the lowest possible configuration, while preserving relative shapes or connections where applicable, resulting in a final "settled" grid that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common number in the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 7 across examples), and only non-background cells move; background cells remain fixed as empty space.
 * Movement is downward due to gravity, but objects do not fall straight down independently—instead, they seem to settle in a way that maintains vertical stacks or connected shapes (e.g., in Training 1, the 4's form a vertical column in col 4, with 2 and 8's adjacent in col 5; in Training 2, numbers like 4, 3, 2 form diagonal or stepped patterns rather than flat piles).
 * Subtle sliding: If directly below is blocked, objects may shift left/right to the nearest empty space below (possibly diagonally), but not arbitrarily—expected outputs show minimal horizontal disruption, keeping objects in roughly their original column ranges (e.g., no excessive leftward drift).
 * Connected components: Objects of the same number may be treated as rigid or semi-rigid blobs that fall together (e.g., in Training 4, the 8's and 3's maintain a zigzag shape when fallen; in Training 5, 9's and 3's stack with 6's below without merging). Different numbers do not merge or block each other unless stacked.
 * Iteration until stable: Simulate steps until no more moves are possible, but process in a way that avoids overwriting or premature blocking (e.g., top-to-bottom row processing can cause chain reactions, but current impl leads to clumping).
 * Edge cases: Grids of varying sizes (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); empty or all-background grids return unchanged; objects at bottom don't move; multiple object types interact by stacking vertically but not horizontally overlapping unless connected.
 * No rotation or deformation: Shapes drop as wholes or cell-by-cell but end up in expected low-energy states (e.g., Training 3 shows a complex shape with 2's, 7's, 9's spread across cols 6-11 but settled in a tree-like vertical structure).
 * Order of movement matters: Processing from top rows first can cause upper objects to fall and block lower ones incorrectly; diagonal moves (down-left/right) are attempted but over-applied in current code, leading to unwanted sliding.
 * Final stability: No floating objects; everything non-background is at the bottom, stacked from row n-1 upward, with gaps filled by background only where no stacking occurs.

(This function correctly identifies the background and is essential for distinguishing movable objects from empty space.)

                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    if visited[cr][cc] or g[cr][cc] != val:
                        continue
                    visited[cr][cc] = True
                    component.append((cr, cc, val))
                    # Add 4-neighbors (up, down, left, right); extend to 8 for diagonals if needed.
                    for dr, dc in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                        nr, nc = cr + dr, cc + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < len(g) and 0 <= nc < len(g[0]) and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                if component:
                    objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This would help identify and move entire blobs rigidly downward, preserving shapes—key for matching expected configurations; current attempt lacks this, leading to disassembly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly detects background (e.g., 0 in Train 1/4/5, 7 in Train 2, 1 in Train 3) and runs an iterative simulation loop until no moves occur, which is a good core structure for gravity.
 * Simulation attempts downward moves (straight or diagonal) if below is empty, which partially captures gravity but over-applies diagonals, causing excessive left/right sliding (e.g., in Train 1, 4's shift left to cols 1-4 instead of staying near col 4-5; in Train 2, 4/3/2 pile flat at bottom instead of stepped verticals).
 * All training examples failed: Train 1 generated a left-clumped pile ([0,4,4,4,4,8,8] in row 6, [0,0,0,0,2,8,8] in row 5) vs. expected vertical stack in cols 4-5 with gaps ([0,0,0,0,4,2,0] etc.); difference is unwanted horizontal compression and no shape preservation—unknown why diagonals caused left bias, but it disrupts columns.
 * Train 2 generated full-background upper rows with bottom pile ([7,7,7,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2] in row 11, etc.) vs. expected sparse vertical/diagonal drops (e.g., 4's in col 4 rows 0-4, 3's stepping down); failed to spread objects, clumping them instead—diagonal moves likely merged them incorrectly.
 * Train 3 generated near-all-background with bottom mess ([1,1,1,1,1,2,2,7,2,2,1,1,1,1] wait, actually [1's] with partial clump in row 16) vs. expected tall vertical structure (2's in col 6 rows 0-6, 7's/9's branching rightward); huge difference in vertical extent and positioning—sim treats cells independently, ignoring connections.
 * Train 4 generated bottom rows with partial clump ([0,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5] in row 9, etc.) vs. expected zigzag verticals (8's/3's alternating cols 2-3, 5's in col 4); failed to alternate positions, stacking horizontally instead.
 * Train 5 generated bottom clump ([9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6] in row 8, [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0] in row 7) vs. expected verticals (9's in col 3 rows 0-4, 3's col 2 rows 2-3, 6's col 5 rows 5-8); again, clumping without column preservation.
 * No training passed, indicating core issue: cell-by-cell movement without blob extraction or proper collision handling leads to disassembly and incorrect settling.
 * The diagonal move logic (down-right/left) is broken/not helpful—intended for sliding but causes over-sliding and bias (e.g., prefers left in some cases); remove or condition it better (e.g., only if straight down blocked and side is lowest).
 * No other functions tried; extract_objects (suggested above) is essential for future attempts to handle connected same-number groups rigidly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it shows a large all-5 background grid (22 cols? assuming n=22 based on lists) with objects (8,3,6,9,4,1) clumped messily in the bottom 4 rows (e.g., row 20: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,6,8,9,9,9,9,5,...] with horizontal spreading and mixing of types, row 21: [3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,9,9,5,...]), while upper rows are pure 5's.
 * This is incorrect because expected likely mirrors training: objects should fall into distinct vertical stacks or preserved shapes in their approximate original columns (e.g., 8's/3's/4's/1's/9's/6 in separate cols without merging into a flat pile; e.g., 4's might stack in one col, 9's in another, with minimal sliding). The clumping ignores connections (e.g., 9's and 1's should not horizontally blend) and over-slides (similar to training failures), resulting in a non-stable, merged mess instead of separated low positions—does not make sense as a final gravity state, as it looks unstable and shape-destroying.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the background color is identified, non-background connected components (objects of the same color) are extracted, some components are "fixed" and remain in place while others are "moved" or restructured according to spatial rules (possibly shifting toward the right, bottom, or specific alignments while preserving or adapting shapes), and the result is recomposed into a new grid. The goal is to infer and apply rules that match the expected outputs, which often involve relocating or reshaping moving components without overlapping or losing pixels unnecessarily.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color, correctly identified in all examples (e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3), but components must exclude it precisely using 4-connected (up/down/left/right) adjacency, not 8-connected, to avoid merging unrelated pixels.
 * Components are grouped by color, and each color's components are processed separately; multiple components per color exist (e.g., ex1 has separate 2 and 8, ex2 has 2/3/4), but the program treats them individually without merging or ordering by size/color value.
 * Fixed vs. moving distinction is crucial but mishandled: fixed components seem to be those touching specific borders (e.g., top or right in expectations, like vertical stacks on the right in ex1/ex2), while moving ones are relocated (e.g., to the right side or bottom, often vertically aligned but preserving approximate shape or connectivity, not just flattened to a column).
 * Transformations for moving components must preserve pixel count and rough shape (e.g., ex1 expected keeps 4's somewhat vertical on right with 2/8 attached below; ex4/5 show diagonal or L-shapes rotated/flipped to bottom-right), but avoid overlaps by placing in available space (e.g., col4-5 in ex1, not col0); the program's "straighten vertically in leftmost column" loses shape, caps at n pixels (causing truncation), and ignores direction (should be rightward or downward "gravity").
 * Subtle elements: Moving components may rotate 90 degrees (e.g., ex4/5 show horizontal-to-vertical shifts), attach to fixed ones without overwriting (e.g., ex1's 2 between 4 and 8), or stack by color order (low to high? ex2 has 2 at bottom, 3 above, 4 top); grids vary in size (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9), so rules must scale; no pixel loss unless conflict, but program causes loss via capping.
 * Ordering: Components may be placed by color ascending/descending or size, starting from bottom-right (e.g., ex2's 2 spans rows 6-11 in col7, 3 in col4 rows3-5, 4 in col4 rows0-2); fixed ones anchor positions (e.g., ex1's implied fixed 8 stays low-right).
 * Edge cases: Large backgrounds (ex2/3) dominate, small components (ex5's single pixels?); potential overlaps resolved by priority (fixed first, then moving); all pixels must be placed within bounds without wrapping.
 * General: Preserve exact pixel counts per color/component; output must match exactly, including background fills; subtle mismatches like shifted positions (e.g., ex1 generated left-col 4's vs. expected right-col) indicate wrong fixed/moving criteria.

(This works well for all examples, as background is indeed the mode.)

                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components[color].append(component)
    result = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            result.append((color, comp))
    return result
```
(This is essential and correct: accurately extracts 4-connected same-color blobs, handling multiple per color; useful for all steps.)

```python
def get_bbox(component: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Compute bounding box: min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c."""
    rows = [r for r, c in component]
    cols = [c for r, c in component]
    return min(rows), max(rows), min(cols), max(cols)
```
(Helpful for analyzing positions, e.g., to check border touches for fixed/moving.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background and extracts components but fails on fixed/moving classification and transformations, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * is_fixed function is broken: uses min_r <=2 (top-touching) or max_c >=n-2 (right-touching), but in ex1, left-top 4's are generated as fixed (stay left) while expected moves them right; ex2 keeps left structures fixed but expected relocates to center-right; doesn't match subtle border rules (likely top/right fixed, left/bottom moving).
 * transform_moving is unhelpful and incorrect: simplifies to vertical stack in col0 from row0, capping at n pixels (causes loss/truncation, e.g., ex2's long 2 component shortened?); ignores shape preservation, rotation, or right/bottom placement (e.g., ex1 expected vertical on col4-5 with attachments, not col0).
 * keep_fixed is fine but unused effectively due to wrong classification.
 * place_pixels is helpful but overwrites without priority (fixed first needed); causes overlaps or empty spaces in generated (e.g., ex1 has 4/2/8 scattered left vs. expected clustered right).
 * Train 1: Generated keeps 4 vertical left (rows0-5 col0), 2 at row1 col5 (unmoved?), 8 at row3-6 col5; expected moves 4 to col4 rows1-4/col5 row0, 2 at row1 col5 (partial match but shifted), 8 vertical col5 rows3-6 (shape preserved but 4 moved wrong).
 * Train 2: Generated stacks 2/4 vertical left cols0-1, fills rest with 7; expected diagonal-ish placement: 4 horizontal-ish top col4, 3 vertical col3-4 mid, 2 vertical col7 bottom; total mismatch in positions/shapes.
 * Train 3: Generated keeps 9/2 vertical left-top, 7 scattered; expected moves 9/7/2 to bottom-right cluster (rows7-15 cols6-10), 2 vertical col6 rows0-6; ignores vertical extension and relocation.
 * Train 4: Generated keeps 5 vertical left, 3 at row1-2 col2-3? but flattened; expected rotates/shifts 8/3 to top-right L-shape cols2-3 rows0-3, 5 vertical col4 bottom rows4-9; shape and position wrong.
 * Train 5: Generated keeps 6/3 vertical left; expected shifts 9/3 to top-mid cols2-3 rows0-4, 6 vertical col5 bottom rows5-8; again, left-placement vs. right/bottom.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates component extraction but no understanding of movement rules (e.g., why left-to-right shift?); unhelpful functions like transform_moving should be discarded/replaced with shape-preserving shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it places components (colors 1,3,8,9 on background 5) as vertical stacks mostly in col0-1 top-to-mid (1 rows0-3 col0, 8 rows1-4 col1-2?, 3 rows4-6 col0, 9 rows7-8 col0), filling rest with 5's, resembling the flawed left-top stacking from training.
 * This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should relocate moving components to right/bottom, preserving shapes like diagonals or attachments, not flattening left); for 22x22 grid with colors 1/3/5/8/9, likely expects clustered right/bottom (e.g., 1 fixed top-left?, 8/3 mid-right, 9 bottom), but generated ignores scale and places everything left, causing sparse/wrong layout.
 * No shape preservation (e.g., if input has extended 1's or 5's as background? wait, 5 is bg here); overlaps none but positions all wrong, similar to train failures—does not account for border-touching fixed (e.g., top row 1's might be fixed, but 8/3/9 moved right/down).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the background color (most frequent) is identified, connected components of non-background colors are extracted, "stable" components (strictly vertical lines without gaps) are preserved in place, and non-stable components (any non-vertical or gapped shapes) are repositioned or redistributed in a structured way to form new vertical alignments, possibly simulating sorting, falling, or stacking while conserving pixel counts per color. The goal is to produce a cleaned-up grid with vertical color stacks in specific columns, often shifting non-vertical blobs to form coherent vertical lines in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color overall, used to fill erased areas; non-background colors form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Stable components are purely vertical: same column, consecutive rows with no gaps (e.g., a straight line from min_row to max_row with exactly max-min+1 cells); any horizontal spread, gaps, or non-straight alignment disqualifies the entire color's components for stability.
 * For stable colors, all components must be vertical to keep the color; if any component for a color is non-vertical, the entire color is treated as unstable and repositioned (not just the bad component).
 * Non-stable colors' pixels are collected entirely (all instances of that color), and their count must be conserved approximately, but repositioned into new vertical stacks, often in dedicated columns, starting from the bottom or in a sequence that matches the original "order" or shape projection.
 * Repositioning non-stables: Not random or diagonal; instead, they seem to "fall" or stack vertically in new columns (e.g., shifting left/right to empty columns, forming L-shapes or diagonals turned vertical), preserving relative ordering of colors from the input (e.g., top-to-bottom or left-to-right scan).
 * Subtle: Outputs often have non-stables forming partial verticals or connected shapes that mimic input blobs but aligned vertically; background fills everything else. Pixel counts per color are exactly preserved. Grids are square (n x n), but components can span partial heights.
 * Edge cases: Single-pixel or short verticals are stable if straight; multi-component colors are stable only if all are vertical. No 8-connectivity—strictly 4. Overwriting only on background; no merging of colors.
 * Conservation: Total pixels per color unchanged, but positions shifted to avoid overlaps and fill from specific starting points (e.g., bottom-up in columns).
 * Common misses: Treating partial verticals as stable when gapped; placing non-stables sequentially without regard to original shape/orientation; failing to shift entire blobs as units rather than scattering pixels.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core issues in repositioning non-stable components.
 * Train 1: Generated placed 4's horizontally in row 0 and scattered 2/8 vertically wrong; expected has 4's shifted to col4 rows1-3 + col5 row0, 2 at row1 col5, 8's vertical in col5 from row3 down—generated ignored original positions for stables and used diagonal for non-stables, mismatching vertical stacking and column choices (unknown why diagonal was chosen, but it scattered instead of stacking).
 * Train 2: Generated kept some 7's but placed 3's/4's horizontally in row0 and vertical 2's in col7; expected has 4's vertical in col4 rows0-2, 3's diagonal-to-vertical in col3-4 rows1-5, 2's vertical in col7 from row5 down—generated treated 3/4 as non-stable and diagonal-placed, losing the partial-diagonal preservation turned vertical.
 * Train 3: Generated placed 2's vertical in col6 rows0-6, 1's scattered with 9's vertical in col9; expected keeps 2's vertical in col6 rows0-6 (correctly stable), but shifts 7's/9's into a connected vertical/diagonal stack starting row6 col7 downward and rightward—generated kept stables but diagonal-placed non-stables (7/9?) in wrong columns, breaking the connected shape.
 * Train 4: Generated placed 8's horizontal in row0, 3's scattered vertical in col2, 5's vertical in col4; expected has 8/3 forming a diagonal snake turned into verticals in cols 1-3 rows1-3, 5's vertical in col4 from row4 down—generated scattered 8/3 as non-stables on diagonal instead of preserving blob connectivity as vertical stack.
 * Train 5: Generated 9's horizontal row0, 3's vertical col3 rows2-3, 6's vertical col5 rows5-8; expected 9/3 as diagonal verticalized in cols2-3 rows0-4, 6's vertical col5 rows6-8—similar scattering issue, diagonal placement overwrote wrong positions without forming original blob's vertical projection.
 * Function `place_non_stable_as_diagonal` is broken/not helpful: It sequentially fills from top-left diagonal, ignoring original shapes/columns, leading to horizontal spreads and wrong counts/placements; do not use in future—replace with vertical stacking in shifted columns.
 * `keep_stable_components` works partially (preserves true verticals like 2's in train3, 6's/5's in trains4-5) but fails when non-stables overwrite or when partial verticals are misclassified.
 * `find_components` and `is_vertical_component` are essential and correct for extraction/stability check.
 * Overall: Stable detection works for clear verticals but repositioning fails entirely—non-stables need to be reformed as vertical stacks in sequential empty columns (e.g., left-to-right), preserving pixel order from input scan (row-major) or blob centroids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows massive horizontal spreads of 8's/9's/3's/4's/5's in row0-1, then huge vertical blocks of 5's filling most of the grid (rows2-17), with 6/1 scattered at bottom— this appears as over-placement of 5's (likely background or dominant non-stable flooded wrongly) and ignores vertical stacking, resulting in a mostly uniform 5-block with misplaced singles, unlike expected patterns in training (compact vertical color stacks in specific columns without flooding). It scatters non-stables horizontally/diagonally per the flawed function, losing all shape preservation; does not make sense as it violates pixel conservation per color (5's dominate unnaturally) and fails to form coherent verticals—must account for sequential column assignment for non-stables (e.g., place each color's pixels vertically in next available column from bottom, preserving input order) to handle large/complex tests.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where non-background colors (treated as "objects" or blobs) are rearranged into vertical stacks within the grid, likely simulating gravity or consolidation rules, while preserving the background (most common color, often 0 or 7 or 1 or 5) and avoiding overlaps. The goal appears to be grouping each color into a single vertical column based on some positional heuristic (e.g., average or median column of original positions), then stacking instances of that color contiguously from the bottom of the grid upward, but the exact ordering of colors and stacking direction/start point is critical and not fully captured.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is correctly identified as the most frequent value (e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test), and all non-background positions are cleared to it before repopulating.
 * Each non-background color is treated as independent "objects" or instances, collected by their original positions; the number of instances per color must be preserved exactly (e.g., four 4's, one 2, four 8's in ex1).
 * Column selection for stacking seems based on original positions of that color (e.g., average column works partially but fails when positions are spread out, as in ex1 where 4's avg to col2 but should be col4; perhaps use median column or leftmost/rightmost instead to better match expected clustering).
 * Stacking is vertical (same column for all instances of a color), but direction and starting point are wrong: current code stacks from the minimum original row upward (top-down), leading to mid-grid or top placements (e.g., 2 at row1 in ex1, 9's starting mid in ex3); expected often stacks from the bottom upward (gravity-like, filling from row n-1 down to cover exactly k rows where k=count of color).
 * Overlaps occur when multiple colors average to the same column (e.g., 4 and 8 both trying col5? in ex1 generated, but code overwrites sequentially); expected avoids this by assigning distinct columns or adjusting positions (e.g., ex1 uses col4 for 4's and col5 for 2/8, with 2 floating higher).
 * Subtle ordering: Colors may need to be processed in a specific sequence (e.g., by color value ascending/descending, or by original appearance order) to resolve column conflicts; in ex2, 4's and 3's interleave slightly before full stacking, suggesting partial horizontal preservation or blob connectivity.
 * Blobs/connectivity: If same-color adjacent cells form "blobs," they might need to be treated as single units (e.g., in ex4, 3's are stacked but shifted left; generated treats individually, leading to col2 for 3's but expected col3 with diagonal flavor); however, examples suggest individual cells, not strict blobs, but adjacency might influence column choice.
 * Grid size varies (7x7 in ex1/3, 12x12? in ex2, 10x10 in ex4, 9x9 in ex5, 22x22? in test with 22 elems/row), so n=len(g) is essential; ensure placements stay within bounds (0 <= r < n, 0 <= c < n).
 * Edge cases: Single-instance colors (e.g., 2 in ex1) don't stack but may "float" higher than full stacks (row1 vs bottom); empty colors or all-bg grids return unchanged.
 * No rotation, mirroring, or horizontal movement beyond column selection; output must match expected exactly, including 0/bg positions.
 * Potential miss: In ex3, 2's stack top-to-mid in col6, 7's shift right/down to col7 rows6-12 then col9-10, 9's at col9 rows9-11 with 7 below; suggests column assignment might prioritize original median col and stack from bottom, but with color ordering affecting overlaps (e.g., place lower colors first).
 * In ex5, diagonal-like preservation (9 and 3 interleave in cols 2-3) hints at not fully collapsing to single column per color—perhaps stack in original columns but drop down vertically per column independently (simple gravity per column), but that fails ex1 (would keep 4's scattered).

    """Computes a column for stacking; current avg, but consider median: sorted_cols = sorted(j for _, j in positions); return sorted_cols[len(sorted_cols)//2]"""
    if not positions:
        return 0
    cols = [j for _, j in positions]
    return sum(cols) // len(cols)  # Avg; alternative: min(cols) or max(cols) for edges
```
(Note: The clear_and_place logic in the original program is partially helpful but broken due to top-down stacking and no conflict resolution; avoid sequential overwriting without checks.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions/tools:**
 * The stacking loop in the original program (`for idx in range(k): r = min_row + idx; grid[r][avg_col] = c`) is broken: uses min_row (top-biased) instead of bottom-up (e.g., r = n - 1 - idx), causes overlaps without checking if cell is free, and doesn't handle color ordering.
 * Flat list creation is redundant if using row/col loops; Counter on flat is fine but not essential beyond bg.
 * No blob extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) was attempted, but it might be irrelevant since examples treat cells individually; don't pursue unless diagonals suggest otherwise (unproven).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg and collects per-color positions, which is a core step, but fails all training due to wrong stacking mechanics.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 2 at row1 col5 (partial match for position but wrong height), 4's at rows3-6 col2 (wrong col, overwrites potential space, should be col4 rows1-4 with offset), 8's at rows3-6 col5 (correct col but overwrites 2's space and starts too high; expected has 8's bottom 4 rows col5, 4's shifted left, 2 higher in col5).
 * Train 2: Generated repeats 4's top 3 rows col4 (close but no interleaving with 3's at col3), then 3's mid-bottom col4 (overwrites), 2's bottom col7 (partial col match); expected has 4's col4 top, 3's col3 rows1-2 then col4 bottom-up with gaps, 2's col7 bottom—mismatch in interleaving and full bottom-stacking.
 * Train 3: Generated 2's top-mid col6 (correct col but too many rows? wait, stacks 7 times but count=7?), 7's mid-bottom col10 (wrong col, should shift to col7 then col9), 9's bottom col9 (correct col but overlaps 7's); expected preserves top 2's stack, shifts 7's right/down in steps, 9's mid with 7 below—suggests non-overwrite placement order by row or color.
 * Train 4: Generated 3's rows1-3 col2 (wrong col and top-start), 8's rows4-8 col2 (overwrites 3's, wrong col), 5's rows4-8 col4 (partial col but overlaps); expected spreads 8/3 diagonally left in cols2-3 top-mid, then 5's bottom col4—mismatch indicates possible per-column gravity with horizontal shift for connections.
 * Train 5: Generated 3's rows2-3 col3 (correct col but mid, not top-diagonal), 9's row5 col1 (wrong col), 6's rows5-8 col5 (partial col); expected diagonals 9/3 in cols2-3 rows2-3, then 9 row4 col3, 6 bottom col5—suggests preserving relative horizontal positions while dropping vertically.
 * Overall: Avg column heuristic works for some (e.g., 8's col in ex1), but fails spread-out colors (4's in ex1); top-down stacking causes mid/top placements vs expected bottom-up; no overlap resolution leads to overwrites (e.g., multiple colors in col3 ex test); individual cell treatment ignores potential blob/diagonal preservation.
 * extract_objects equivalent (positions dict) is essential for grouping; without it, can't isolate colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows messy mid-grid stacking with overlaps and top-biased placements (e.g., 8's rows1-3 col3, 9's rows4-12 col11, 3's rows8-13 col3 overwriting 8's, 6 at row17 col7, 4/1 at row19-21 col4/8), leaving top/bottom mostly bg=5 but no clear vertical consolidation per color.
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., no bottom-up full stacks, colors like 8/3/9 crammed in few columns with overwrites, 4/1/6 not dropped fully); likely wrong because column avgs cluster too many (8/3 in col3), stacking starts high (e.g., 8's at row1 vs bottom), and no ordering to space out columns (e.g., 9 at col11 far right, but test input likely has spread positions).
 * To handle test, need bottom-up stacking (r = n - k + idx or n-1 - idx), median col instead of avg for outliers, place colors in sorted order (e.g., by min color value) with column adjustment if occupied, and check for per-column gravity alternative if diagonals persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a puzzle simulating gravity in a 2D grid where non-background cells of the same value form connected components that fall downward (increasing row index, assuming row 0 is top), stacking on the bottom or other components, similar to match-3 games like Candy Crush or Puyo Puyo, but with evidence of a removal step for matched groups (3+ connected same value) after falling, as cell counts decrease in some examples (e.g., example 1: 6 to 4 for value 4; example 4: 6 to 5 for value 8).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are groups of same-value non-background cells; the attempt uses 4-connected (up/down/left/right), but examples suggest 8-connected (including diagonals) may be needed for proper grouping and potential matching, as seen in expected diagonal chains (e.g., example 2 3's form a diagonal line).
 * Gravity is downward (vertical drop only in the attempt, but examples show possible sideways shifting or sliding when blocked, e.g., example 1 4's shift right to col4-5; example 4 8's/3's shift left to col1-3).
 * Processing order is critical: sort by lowest point (max row) descending to drop bottom components first, avoiding interference; the attempt does this correctly, but fails because rigid-body drop doesn't account for irregular shapes (e.g., protruding bases hit bounds before upper parts fall).
 * Drop mechanics: Components fall as rigid bodies until blocked, but the attempt's one-row-at-a-time check fails for shapes where min fall distance is 0 due to bounds/overlaps; need to compute max uniform shift k where all shifted positions are in-bounds and empty (after clearing old), then shift by k.
 * Removal step likely after falling: Remove groups of 3+ connected same value (possibly 8-connected), then re-apply gravity to remaining cells above; this explains cell count reductions (e.g., example 1 likely removes some 4's after they connect; example 3/2/5 no removal as groups <3 or not triggering). Subtle: Removal may chain (multiple iterations until no matches).
 * Background is most common value (works in attempt); empty space is background.
 * Grid orientation: Row 0 top, higher rows bottom; drop increases row indices.
 * No rotation or color change; preserve all non-removed cells.
 * Subtle: If no space below entire component, it stays; upper components fall onto lowered ones.
 * Per-cell falling (independent per column) doesn't fit examples (e.g., example 1 4's would stack in original columns, not shift right).
 * After removal, gaps cause above cells/components to fall further.
 * All examples require multiple components interacting (e.g., 2 falls onto 8's in example 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""

        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This works well for identifying bg, e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test.)

    """Find 4-connected components of same non-background value using flood-fill."""

        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Change to 8-connected: add (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                value = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == value:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, value))
    return components
```
(Flood-fill for components is essential and correct, but switch to 8-connected for matching/diagonal connections; used successfully for identification, but drop fails after.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
The `drop_one_row` and `drop_component` functions are broken for irregular shapes: they attempt incremental 1-row drops but fail immediately if any part (e.g., base protrusion) hits bounds/overlaps, preventing any movement (e.g., ex1 4's can't drop due to row6 parts going to row7). Do not use in future; replace with max-shift calculation. No removal function exists, causing cell count mismatches where expected removes matches.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identifies background and finds connected components via flood-fill, but 4-connected misses diagonal connections needed for full grouping/matching (e.g., ex2 3's diagonal chain).
 * Sorting components by max row descending (lowest first) works conceptually to avoid upper components blocking lower drops.
 * Rigid-body vertical drop fails for non-rectangular shapes: whole component shifts only if all parts can move equally, but irregular bases hit bottom/bounds first (e.g., ex1 4's L-shape base at row6 prevents drop, output unchanged; similar in ex4 8's/3's).
 * No sideways sliding: expected shows lateral movement when vertical blocked (e.g., ex1 4's shift right to col4-5; ex4 8's/3's shift left, forming snake-like stack).
 * Missing removal step: After drop, connected groups of 3+ same value (likely 8-connected) should be cleared, causing cell count drop (e.g., ex1 generated 6 4's vs expected 4; ex4 generated 6 8's vs 5), then re-drop remaining; without this, outputs retain all cells and don't match.
 * In ex2, partial drop happens (e.g., 2's stack at bottom col7, 4's/3's shift left/up), but not fully (3's/4's not diagonal-stacked correctly; no removal, but counts match as no trigger).
 * In ex3, no drop (generated = input, components at bottom can't move), but expected has 2's stacked left in col6 rows0-6 (top?), 7's/9's shifted right/down in diagonal (suggests left gravity or rotation? but inconsistent; unknown why 2's move up/left).
 * In ex5, no drop (generated = input), expected has 9's/3 shifted up/left, 6's down, suggesting per-component slide + drop.
 * Train 1 mismatches 4's positions/shift (stays left-bottom vs expected right-stacked near top with partial removal); 2/8 stack wrong (2 not on 8's with gap).
 * Train 4 8's/3's stay right-bottom vs expected left-diagonal stack + removal of 1 8.
 * Function `drop_component` is incorrect (incremental fails rigid check; doesn't compute max k or handle slide/removal; don't use).
 * No chaining: After removal, need re-find components and re-drop (missing in all, causes static outputs).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears unchanged from likely input (all components at bottom rows 17-21, no drop possible under rigid vertical rules, top filled with bg 5), but expected should show dropped/stacked components at bottom (higher rows) with possible left/right shifts (e.g., 3's/4's horizontal groups may stack vertically in cols, 8's cluster fall together, 9's shift, 1's/6 single may fall independently), potential removals (e.g., 3's 7 connected >3, remove all; 4's 6 connected, remove; 9's 8 connected, remove; leaving 8's,1's,6 to stack), and re-drop. Without shifts/removal, it ignores interactions (e.g., 1's vertical may fall onto 5's? but bg; 6 single falls). Accounts for large bg 5 (most common), but no movement indicates failed gravity simulation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers) on a background, where the goal is to detect and erase "invalid" large connected components that aren't simple bars (straight horizontal or vertical lines), then restore the exact number of erased pixels for each affected color by placing them in strategic positions to connect, extend, or bridge between remaining "fixed" components, effectively completing or correcting incomplete shapes while preserving bars and small components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color; all other colors are potential shapes/objects.
 * Connected components use 8-connectivity (including diagonals), so shapes can be diagonally adjacent.
 * "Bars" are strictly contiguous straight lines: either all in one column (vertical, consecutive rows) or one row (horizontal, consecutive columns); anything larger than 3 pixels that's not a bar gets fully erased.
 * Erased colors are restored exactly N pixels (original count), but only if there was at least one large non-bar component for that color; placement prioritizes sorted fixed components (by min row), focusing on upper/lower pairs.
 * Bridging logic: Calculate delta_r (row gap) and delta_c (column shift) between upper component's bottom and lower component's top; use linear interpolation (round(k * abs(delta_c) / delta_r)) for slanted bridges; handle cases where upper_num <= lower_num (left-attach + upper extension) vs. else (lower vertical extension + mirror).
 * If no bridge needed (delta_r <=0) or <2 fixed components, fallback to simple vertical placement (e.g., left/right of a single component).
 * Filler colors are sorted by value for ordered placement; candidates are sets to avoid duplicates, sorted by (row, col) for sequential filling.
 * Subtle edge cases: Handle out-of-bounds, already-filled cells (skip if not bg), rounding in averages/positions, sign of delta_c for direction, and when bridge_col is offset (e.g., -1). No placement if no candidates or N=0.
 * Grids can be rectangular (rows x cols), but examples are square-ish; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Potential misses: Over-erasing if components are misidentified as non-bars; incorrect bridge slopes if delta_r=0 or small; ignoring small components (<4 pixels) which stay fixed; not handling multiple upper/lower pairs or non-vertical gaps well; placement might overlap or skip due to sorting.

(Variant for all remaining non-bg components post-erasure; key for finding anchors to attach/bridge to.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles background detection, component extraction, bar identification, and erasure of large non-bars, as shown by passing training examples 1, 3, and 5.
 * It demonstrates core bridging logic for connecting upper/lower components, including slanted interpolation and conditional extensions/attachments based on component sizes.
 * However, in training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated output places a vertical stack of 3's in column 3 (rows 0-3) and keeps 4's misplaced, while expected has 4 at row0 col4, 3's horizontal in rows1-2 cols3-4, and a 3 at row5 col6 before the 2's bar; the generated ignores the need for horizontal shaping and bridge adjustment, resulting in vertical over-placement (effect: extra 3's in top-left, missing horizontal extension for 3/4 and the row5 3).
 * In training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated keeps 8's vertical in column 1 (rows1-4,6-7?) but places 3's incorrectly, while expected has 8's more spread (row0 col3, row1 col2, row2 col1, row3 col2, row4 col3) forming a diagonal-ish shape, with 3's adjusted; effect: generated fails to bridge/extend 8's properly across the gap to connect to 5's, keeping them too vertical and clustered left (missing the zigzag or slanted restoration).
 * The fallback placement (for <2 components) works in simple cases but over-relies on vertical stacking, which mismatches expected horizontal or offset placements in examples 2 and 4.
 * Sorting fixed_comps by min row is helpful for upper/lower pairing but misses multi-pair or horizontal-dominant scenes.
 * Bridge calculation with round(sum/len) for averages is good for centers but can misalign if components are asymmetric (e.g., in ex4, 8's need more diagonal shift).
 * Candidate set union (attach + bridge + ext) avoids overlaps, but sorting by (row,col) may prioritize top-left too aggressively, filling wrong spots first.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the complex conditional logic in placement (e.g., do_left_attach, mirror_num) is brittle and overfits vertical bridges, failing slanted/horizontal needs in failed examples.
 * Overall, erasure and counting N work well (preserves pixel totals), but placement candidates are insufficiently flexible for non-vertical gaps or when delta_c is large.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules inferred from training; it erases and restores some elements (e.g., 3's bar in row8 cols0-6, vertical 4's descending from row9 col4 to row15 col7, then 8's/6/1's in lower right), but the slanted progression of 4's and isolated 6 at row18 col7 suggest incomplete bridging—likely meant to connect a upper shape (possibly the 3's) to lower ones (1's?), but the 8's at row16-17 col7-8 and single 6 seem like a failed interpolation (effect: abrupt 6 instead of smooth slant, and 1's vertical in col8 without attachment to above).
 * Compared to training failures, this mirrors ex4's issue: vertical bias in placement (4's stack down-right) instead of expected diagonal/horizontal restoration to match shape continuity; the all-5 top (rows0-7) implies heavy erasure, but restoration starts too late/low, missing potential upper extensions.
 * Without explicit expected, it partially makes sense (total pixels per color likely match N), but the disjoint lower elements (6/8/1) indicate missed subtle diagonal connectivity or mirror extension, making it incorrect for a complete shape.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 5 train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties that appear in **EVERY** train example. I focused solely on patterns that hold true across all 5 cases without exception, ignoring any non-consistent or speculative changes (e.g., pixel count variations, hole changes, or color-specific behaviors that don't occur universally). No high-level puzzle solving or total understanding is implied or attempted. Connections are limited to those directly observable in property transformations (e.g., position, color persistence) between input and output. If a potential interaction could not be confirmed as consistent and explainable across all examples (e.g., specific color-to-hole effects or directional movement biases), it is called out as unknown rather than forced.

- **Position affects shape persistence or replication for same-color components**: In every train example, components of the same color that share overlapping or adjacent y-coordinate ranges in their bounding boxes (bbox) in the input result in output components of the same color that either persist unchanged or replicate/split into multiple instances with adjusted bbox positions (e.g., shifted x/y within the original range). Isolated same-color components (no shared y-range adjacency) always persist unchanged. This interaction does not alter color or holes but consistently transforms position to maintain or expand presence within the shared y-space. Examples: Train 1 (Yellow components at y3-6 adjust to y0-3); Train 2 (Green at y5-8 adjust/replicate to y1-5); Train 3 (Dark Red at y2-6 adjust/replicate to y6-14); Train 4 (Green/Maroon at y1-5 adjust/replicate to y0-4); Train 5 (Light Blue at y5-8 adjust/replicate to y0-5).

- **Color persistence linked to bbox adjacency**: Across all examples, any two or more components whose bbox min_x or max_x values are within 1 unit (indicating horizontal adjacency or overlap potential) in the input will produce output components of matching colors that retain the exact same bbox if unchanged, or transform only the adjacent one's position while preserving the other's. Non-adjacent components (x-difference >1) never affect each other and remain identical. This is a direct position-to-persistence interaction, with no color change. Examples: Train 1 (Yellow at x2-4 adjacent to Maroon/Red at x5; Maroon/Red persist, Yellow position shifts); Train 2 (Greens at x3-6 adjacent; they replicate positions, Dark Red isolated splits independently); Train 3 (Dark Reds at x7-13 adjacent to Blue bbox x0-16; Dark Reds positions shift, Blue bbox persists); Train 4 (Greens/Maroons at x1-3 adjacent; they interleave positions, Orange at x4 isolated persists); Train 5 (Light Blues at x0-4 adjacent to Green/Pink at x3-5; Light Blues shift positions, Green/Pink persist).

- **Unknown: Hole count to position transformation**: Hole properties (when present) consistently interact with position changes in outputs (e.g., components with holes>0 always have bbox y-ranges expanded or shifted), but the direction or mechanism of this effect varies (e.g., splitting in Train 2 vs. single-component expansion in Train 3) and does not occur in hole-free examples (Trains 1, 4, 5), so no universal explanation can be identified without forcing inconsistency.

No other interactions (e.g., pixel count to color, specific shape silhouettes to movement, or vertical position biases) were consistent across every example, as they either varied in direction/mechanism or only appeared in subsets of trains. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., fully isolated components with no bbox adjacency to others) were excluded, as they show no transformation or effect in any example.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:06:23] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells where the background color (most common) is identified, connected components (blobs) of non-background colors are detected using 8-connectivity, certain blobs (those larger than 3 cells and not straight horizontal or vertical bars) are "erased" to background, and the erased cells are then repositioned—likely falling under gravity to stack vertically from the bottom or align with remaining "fixed" structures (bars or small blobs)—while preserving color counts and overall structure integrity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color (e.g., 0 in Train 1/4/5, 7 in Train 2, 1 in Train 3, 5 in test); non-background colors form blobs via 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals), which allows for irregular shapes but must distinguish straight bars correctly.
 * Erase only blobs >3 cells that are NOT bars; bars (perfect horizontal or vertical lines with no gaps or extras) are "fixed" and not erased, serving as supports; small blobs (<=3) or bars remain untouched.
 * After erasure, fixed components (remaining non-background blobs) are sorted by their minimum row (top-to-bottom order); erased colors must be re-placed by "falling" them downward, stacking vertically in their original column centroids or aligned to supports, without diagonal/slanted placement—reconstruction should mimic gravity where blobs drop straight down until hitting bottom or a fixed structure.
 * Subtlety: Connectivity is 8-way, so diagonal touches count as connected (e.g., in Train 3, the 7-9-7 structure spans rows/cols irregularly); bars must be strictly linear (consecutive cells in one row/col, no branches or gaps)—the is_bar function checks this but fails if positions aren't sorted/contiguous properly.
 * Erased cell counts per color must be exactly preserved and placed as single vertical stacks or reformed blobs, often in the original centroid column; avoid scattering or diagonal insertion, as this breaks vertical alignment seen in expectations.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but components may not span full width/height; handle empty rows/cols; after placement, no overlaps with fixed parts or background-only spaces unless filling gaps vertically.
 * Easy to miss: In expectations, erased parts often shift left/right slightly to align under supports (e.g., Train 1: 4's stack in col 4 under implied support, 2/8 in col 5); re-placement isn't always in exact original columns but adjusted for stability; test case has large background (5) with scattered small blobs, suggesting multiple erasures and vertical drops.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect re-placement logic: diagonal/stepped insertion instead of straight vertical drops, leading to misaligned stacks; extra "vertical attach above upper left" and "remaining at bottom" code overcomplicates and scatters cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Reliable for identifying background color via frequency.)

```python
def get_non_background_colors(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> set:
    colors = set()
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            if cell != bg:
                colors.add(cell)
    return colors
```
(Useful for isolating colors to process, though simple; processes in sorted order for consistency.)

```python
def is_vertical_bar(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    if not positions:
        return False
    cols = {c for r, c in positions}
    if len(cols) != 1:
        return False
    col = next(iter(cols))
    rows = sorted(r for r, c in positions)
    min_r = rows[0]
    max_r = rows[-1]
    return max_r - min_r + 1 == len(rows) and len(rows) == len(set(rows))

def is_horizontal_bar(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    if not positions:
        return False
    rows = {r for r, c in positions}
    if len(rows) != 1:
        return False
    row = next(iter(rows))
    cols = sorted(c for r, c in positions)
    min_c = cols[0]
    max_c = cols[-1]
    return max_c - min_c + 1 == len(cols) and len(cols) == len(set(cols))

def is_bar(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    return is_vertical_bar(positions) or is_horizontal_bar(positions)
```
(These correctly identify straight bars by checking single row/col and contiguity; essential for deciding what to erase—helpful but needs exact position sorting.)

```python
def get_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], color: int, bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:

    cols_n = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols_n for _ in range(rows_n)]
    components = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(rows_n):
        for j in range(cols_n):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows_n and 0 <= ny < cols_n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(Core BFS for finding 8-connected blobs per color; very helpful for extraction, but note it ignores bg correctly.)

```python
def get_fixed_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # Similar to above, but for all non-bg colors at once
    rows_n = len(g)
    cols_n = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols_n for _ in range(rows_n)]
    components = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    for i in range(rows_n):
        for j in range(cols_n):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                comp = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    comp.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows_n and 0 <= ny < cols_n and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```
(Useful for identifying remaining supports after erasure; sorts by min row for ordering, but current sorting key assumes non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to flawed re-placement: instead of vertical gravity drops, code inserts erased cells diagonally/stepped between fixed components (e.g., using delta_c for direction and j* direction), leading to slanted lines rather than straight stacks.
 * Train 1: Generated scattered 4's across cols 2/4/5 in rows 0-5 with 2 in row1 col5 and 8's vertical in col5 but offset; expected vertical 4-stack in col4 (rows1-3,0? wait row0 col5=4, but mainly col4/5 alignment for 4/2/8); difference: extra left 4's not erased properly, no left-shift to col4, 2/8 not stacked cleanly under support—unknown why 4's didn't consolidate vertically.
 * Train 2: Generated 3's vertical in col3 rows0-2/7-11? and col4 row3, 4's scattered, 2's in col7 rows5-11 but with extras; expected 4/3's in col4/3 descending to row1-5, then 3/2 in col6/7 rows5-11 vertical; difference: too many 7's (bg) misplaced as fills, 3's not shifted right to col3/4 properly, 2's extended upward incorrectly—no vertical drop from original positions.
 * Train 3: Generated tall vertical 7/2 in cols5/6 rows0-6, then scattered 7/9/7 lower; expected horizontal-ish 2's in col6 rows0-5, then 7 vertical col6 row6, 7/9/7 L-shape rows7-16 cols7/9/10; difference: over-erased and re-stacked 2's/7's as single verticals instead of preserving multi-color connections, 9's not aligned rightward—8-connectivity caught blobs but bar detection failed for partial lines.
 * Train 4: Generated 3's zigzag in col3 rows1-3, 8/5 vertical in col2/4 rows4-9; expected 8/3 zigzag but shifted left in cols3/2/1 rows0-3, then 8/5 vertical col3/4 rows4-9 but 5 shifted left to col4 only lower; difference: 3's not zigzagged correctly (stayed too right), 8's didn't shift left under 5, 5's over-extended horizontally—suggests centroid calc wrong for small blobs.
 * Train 5: Generated 9's scattered in cols1-3 rows0-4/6?, 3's in col3 row2, 6's vertical col5 rows5-8; expected 9's vertical in col4 rows0-4 but split around 3's in col3, 6's vertical col5 rows5-8 but shifted left? Wait, expected has 9's in col3/4 mixed, 3's col3 rows2-3, 6 col5; difference: 9's not reformed as vertical stack in col4, extra 9's left, 3's not connected properly—erasure hit wrong components.
 * Main program logic unhelpful: Erasing works partially (counts erased), but placement (diagonal between fixed, extra above-left attach, bottom dump in centroid) scatters cells instead of dropping vertically per column; sorting fixed_comps by min_r is good but delta_r/delta_c calc leads to slants; original_centroids for bottom placement is conceptually ok but executes after flawed main placement.
 * get_connected_components and is_bar are helpful/accurate for extraction but not for re-placement; overall attempt shows understanding of erasure rules but fails core gravity/re-stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows massive background (5) in top 7 rows, then a horizontal 3-bar in row8 cols0-6, scattered single 4's descending diagonally in rows9-12 cols3/4/5/6, then mixed 8/4/6/1/9 in rows14-20 cols3/7/8/11/12 in a stepped/diagonal pattern, with no vertical stacking—resembles the code's flawed diagonal insertion rather than expected vertical drops (e.g., 3's should stack at bottom in original cols, 4's/8/6/1/9 form clean verticals under supports without slants). This ignores gravity, leaving top empty and bottom cluttered/misaligned; likely over-erased most blobs (assuming many >3 non-bars), then placed remnants slanted between few fixed parts—does not match training expectations of aligned vertical stacks.

[2025-10-02 03:06:47] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 03:10:42] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between properties/components that appear **in EVERY train puzzle** (1 through 5). I focused only on patterns that hold across all 5 without exception, ignoring any that are absent in even one example (e.g., hole count changes only occur in train 2 and 3, so excluded; pixel conservation per color holds in 4/5 but has a discrepancy in train 1, so excluded as not fully consistent). No attempts to explain or infer the underlying puzzle rule or full transformations—only direct, observable connections are noted. Where a connection involves an unexplainable aspect of transformation, it is called out as unknown. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., backgrounds, static large shapes without interaction, inconsistent behaviors) are excluded.

#### 1. **Color → Transformation Type (Movement or Stability)**
   - **Description**: The color of a shape consistently determines whether it undergoes transformation (e.g., position shift, splitting into same-color components) or remains stable. Shapes of the same color behave similarly across examples, while different colors show distinct behaviors.
   - **Observed Interactions**:
     - Yellow: Undergoes position transformation (often involving lower y-coordinates in bbox) in train 1; stable if already at low y in train 2.
     - Green: Undergoes position transformation (often to lower y-coordinates) in train 2 and 5; stable in train 4.
     - Light Blue: Undergoes position transformation (to lower y-coordinates) in train 5; stable in train 3.
     - Maroon: Undergoes position transformation (to lower y-coordinates, with splitting into same-color 1-pixel components) in train 1 and 4.
     - Red: Stable (no position or splitting change) in train 1, 2, and 3.
     - Dark Red: Undergoes transformation (splitting and/or position shift) in train 2 and 3.
     - Pink/Orange/Blue: Stable (no change) where present (train 4 for Orange, train 5 for Pink, train 3 for Blue).
   - **Consistency Note**: This holds in all 5 trains—no shape changes color, and transformation type (move/split vs. stay) is tied to its original color. Unknown: Exact mechanism of how color triggers specific transformation details (e.g., direction or split pattern).

#### 2. **Position (BBox) → Transformation (Movement Direction or Stability)**
   - **Description**: The initial bbox position of a shape interacts with its transformation, where shapes at certain positions (e.g., already at minimal y=0 or edge-aligned) tend to remain stable, while others shift. This interacts with color (above) but is independently observable via bbox changes.
   - **Observed Interactions**:
     - Shapes with low initial min-y (e.g., y=0 or y=1) in bbox often remain stable or undergo minimal change (e.g., Yellow at [4,0,4,2] in train 2; Red at [6,0,6,6] in train 3; Greens at low y in train 4).
     - Shapes with higher initial min-y (e.g., y≥3) in bbox undergo position shifts, often to lower y-values (e.g., Yellows from y=3+ to y=0/1 in train 1; Greens from y=5+ to y=1-5 in train 2; Light Blues from y=5+ to y=0-5 in train 5; Maroons from y=4+ to y=0-4 in train 4).
     - x-position shifts occur alongside y-changes for some (e.g., clustering toward higher x in train 1; horizontal split in train 2 for Dark Red; diagonal spread in train 3 for Dark Red), but y-interaction is more consistent.
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in all 5 trains—every example has at least some shapes whose bbox changes based on initial position, with no counterexamples of high-y shapes staying unchanged without transformation. Unknown: Why some position shifts are vertical-only vs. diagonal/horizontal, or exact threshold for "low y" stability.

#### 3. **Component Count (Per Color) → Same-Color Splitting**
   - **Description**: When a color's components undergo transformation, the number of same-color components can increase via splitting (e.g., one multi-pixel shape becomes multiple smaller ones of same color and total pixels roughly matching original), but this is triggered by position/color (above). Isolated components (no interaction) do not split.
   - **Observed Interactions**:
     - Yellow: Splits implicitly via position change in train 1 (5px +1px → 3px +1px, though total pixels discrepant).
     - Green: Splits into more 1-2px components during position shift in train 2 (three components → four).
     - Dark Red: Splits large/multi into multiple small same-color components in train 2 and 3 (e.g., 129px with holes → two separate; 9px total → seven 1-3px).
     - Maroon: Splits into multiple 1px components during position shift in train 4 (6px total → six 1px).
     - Light Blue: Splits into more 1-2px components during position shift in train 5 (6px total → five components).
   - **Consistency Note**: In all 5 trains, transforming colors (per #1) show component count changes via same-color splitting where multi-pixel shapes are involved; non-transforming colors (e.g., Red, Orange, Pink) have no splitting. No cross-color splitting. Unknown: Precise split logic (e.g., into 1px vs. 2-3px) or why train 1 has pixel discrepancy post-split.

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., involving holes, silhouettes/edges, or direct shape-to-shape effects like adjacency) appear in every train example—such patterns are sporadic or absent in some (e.g., no holes in trains 1, 4, 5). These listed connections do not explain full transformations (e.g., exact new bbox calculations remain unknown).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where a background value (most common number) represents empty space, and non-background tiles appear to "fall" or move downward in columns while possibly preserving some horizontal structure or connections, resulting in stacked formations at the bottom of specific columns rather than uniform sliding.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Non-background tiles move vertically downward (gravity-like) within their columns, stacking from the bottom up, but horizontal positions are not simply slid left/right—tiles seem to maintain or shift to form vertical stacks in columns where they originated or connected.
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent value, but movement is per-column downward, not row-wise sliding; the previous attempt reversed this by sliding right (horizontal) then up (opposite of gravity).
 * Tiles do not merge or combine values (e.g., no 2048-style addition); they retain their numbers and positions relative to each other in a way that suggests independent column processing after possible horizontal alignment.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but examples vary in size (e.g., 7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); ensure code handles variable n without assuming fixed size.
 * Subtle: In expected outputs, some tiles appear to "float" or shift horizontally slightly before falling (e.g., in training 1, the 4's align in column 4 before falling, and 8's stack in column 5); this may indicate pre-processing like left-alignment per row or object detection for connected groups.
 * Easy to miss: Not all non-background tiles fall uniformly—some examples show partial stacks (e.g., training 3 has a vertical line of 2's in column 6 across top rows, then branching to 7 and 9 in lower rows), suggesting possible rotation, connection-based movement, or multi-step processing (horizontal then vertical).
 * No overwriting or merging occurs; empty spaces fill with background only after movement.
 * Consider connected components: Tiles might form "objects" that fall as units, explaining why shapes are preserved (e.g., in training 4, the 8-3 pair shifts down while rotating or aligning).
 * Process columns independently for vertical movement, but rows may need initial left-packing or no horizontal move at all—previous right-slide disrupted this.
 * Edge case: If all tiles are background, return unchanged; if no non-background, no movement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""
    if not g:
        return 0  # Default if empty
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

```python
def fall_down_column(col: List[int], background: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Move non-background tiles down in a column, stacking from bottom."""
    non_bg = [x for x in col if x != background]
    new_col = [background] * n
    # Stack from bottom: place non_bg in reverse order from bottom up
    for idx in range(len(non_bg)):
        new_col[n - 1 - idx] = non_bg[-1 - idx]  # Preserve original top-to-bottom order
    return new_col
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used row-wise right-sliding followed by column-wise up-bubbling, which clumped all non-background tiles to the top-right, inverting the expected downward gravity and disrupting horizontal structures.
 * Worked: Correctly identified background via Counter; copied grid to avoid mutation; separated row and column operations.
 * Didn't work: Horizontal right-slide pushed tiles right unnecessarily (expected shows left or no horizontal shift); upward bubbling opposed gravity (expected stacks at bottom); treated all non-bg independently without preserving order or connections, leading to jumbled stacks (e.g., in training 1, generated has 4's and 2 mixed at top-right, expected has aligned 4's falling to mid-bottom in col4, 2 in col5, 8's stacking bottom in col5).
 * In training 1: Generated clumped to rows 0-5 top-right (e.g., row0 ends [4,4,2]), expected has sparse downward stacks (e.g., row1 [...,4,2,0], row3 [...,4,8,0], bottom rows stacked 8's in col5)—difference in direction and no horizontal push.
 * In training 2: Generated slid everything right then up, filling top rows with 7's and clumping 3,4,2 to right columns (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,4]), expected shows diagonal-like fall with 4/3 shifting left-down (e.g., row0 [...,4,7,...], row3 [...,3,7,...], 2 stacking bottom-right in col7)—horizontal left-alignment missing, upward wrong.
 * In training 3: Generated messed up vertical lines (e.g., row0 ends [2,2,7,2], row2 [...,7,7,7]), expected preserves top vertical 2's in col6, then branches 7 right-down to col7, 9 further right-down to col9 with 7 wrap—suggests object tracing or path-following, not simple slide; attempt ignored connections.
 * In training 4: Generated right-up clump (e.g., row0 [...,8,8,3], row3 [...,8,5]), expected shows rotation/shift down-left (e.g., row0 [...,8,0,...], row1 [...,8,3,0,...], row2 [8,3,0,...], then 8-5 fall to col3-4 bottom)—attempt's slide lost the pair's relative positions.
 * In training 5: Generated right-up (e.g., row0 [...,9,9,9,3], row2 [...,9,6]), expected down-left stacks (e.g., row0 [...,9,0,...], row2 [...,9,3,0,...], 9-6 fall to col4-5 bottom)—similar loss of horizontal structure.
 * Function `slide_right_row` is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle (pushes right, but expected often left or none; don't use).
 * Function `bubble_up_column` is wrong direction (up instead of down; reverse to fall_down for future).
 * No object extraction attempted, but may be needed for connected groups—consider adding to trace shapes before falling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (22x22 grid?) clumps non-background tiles (3,8,9,4,6,1) via right-slide then up-bubble, resulting in top-heavy fillings (e.g., row0 ends [3,3,8,8,8,9,8], row8 [...,6], bottom rows all 5's/background)—this looks incorrect as it inverts gravity and mixes tiles horizontally/vertically without structure.
 * Does not match training expected patterns: Expected likely has downward stacks in specific columns (e.g., 3/8/9 falling to bottom in leftish cols, preserving any pairs like 4-3 or 9-6), but generated has top-right mess (e.g., 3's and 9's scattered top, 6/1 low but not stacked bottom)—missing left-align and down-fall.
 * Test has more tiles (3,8x4,9x3,4x2,6,1) scattered initially; output ignores potential connections (e.g., clustered 8's/9's should stack as group bottom, not bubble up).
 * Overall, test output does not make sense—it's a top-right pile-up, while puzzle seems bottom-left/downward formation; update to column-down fall after possible left-row pack to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle simulating gravity on a grid where non-background cells (numbers) fall downward, but connected groups (blobs or "objects") of the same number must fall as rigid, intact units rather than scattering per cell or per column. The goal is to apply gravity such that these connected components drop as wholes until they stack on the bottom, other components, or the grid floor, while preserving their relative shapes and positions within the component.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is correctly identified as the most frequent number (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 7 across examples), and only non-background cells move; background fills vacated spaces.
 * Connectivity is key: Use 4-connected (up/down/left/right, not diagonal) or possibly 8-connected groups of identical numbers as "objects" that fall rigidly together—do not break them into individual cells or columns.
 * Falling order matters: Components likely need to be processed from lowest to highest (bottom-up simulation) to avoid overlaps or premature stacking; simulate step-by-step drops (one row at a time per component) until no more movement is possible.
 * Stacking rules: When a component falls, it drops until any of its cells hits the bottom row, another stable component below, or background— the entire shape shifts down uniformly.
 * Subtleties: Components can interlock or stack in non-column-aligned ways (e.g., overhanging shapes); horizontal connections across columns must be preserved (e.g., rows of 4's fall as a bar, not splitting). No rotation or deformation—rigid drop only. Handle empty grids or all-background as no-op. Potential for multiple components of the same number to fall separately if not connected. Diagonal connections probably don't count (based on examples where shapes don't merge diagonally). In complex cases (e.g., train3), nested or L-shaped blobs form and fall without filling gaps internally.
 * Edge cases: Grids of varying sizes (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); components touching the bottom don't move; if components would overlap after falling, resolve by order (e.g., lower ones first).
 * All training examples failed because per-column falling ignores connectivity, causing shapes to distort (e.g., horizontal bars become vertical stacks).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `find_background` function is helpful and correct for identifying the background color via frequency count.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

The provided `fall_down_column` function is unhelpful/broken for this puzzle—it applies gravity per column independently, which splits connected components (do not reuse or adapt directly; it ignores horizontal/vertical bonds).

To solve, need new functions for connected components (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) and rigid falling simulation:

            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                value = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()

                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == value:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append((component, value))
    return components
```

```python
def drop_component(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], value: int, background: int, rows: int) -> Tuple[List[List[int]], int]:

    while True:
        # Check if can drop one more row
        can_drop = True
        new_positions = [(r + 1, c) for r, c in component]
        for r, c in new_positions:

        component = new_positions  # Update for next check
    return g, drop_rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used per-column gravity, which worked for identifying background correctly (e.g., 0 in train1/4/5, 7 in train2, 1 in train3) and basic downward stacking in isolated columns, but failed entirely on preserving connected shapes—components split and reformed vertically, distorting blobs (e.g., horizontal groups of 4's or 8's became scattered vertical stacks).
 * Train1: Generated stacked 4's and 8's at bottom of cols independently, but expected shows a connected "L" or bar of 4's falling as a unit to mid-right, with 2 and 8 stacking adjacently without splitting; difference: generated has 4's duplicated/stacked wrong in col3/6, 2 misplaced high.
 * Train2: Generated per-column drop turned horizontal 3's/4's into verticals at bottom, with 2 isolated; expected keeps some horizontal structure and stacks 3's/4's as partial bars in cols3-5, with 2 at bottom col7—difference: generated has 3's only in bottom row col3, 4's split vertically in col4, ignoring connections.
 * Train3: Generated crammed everything to bottom rows with vertical stacks (e.g., 7's and 9's aligned in cols), but expected spreads shapes horizontally (e.g., 7's form an L-shape across rows7-16 in varying cols, 9's horizontal in cols9-10); difference: generated ignores blob shapes entirely, filling bottom uniformly; 2's stacked vertically in col6.
 * Train4: Generated vertical stacks of 3's/8's in cols2-4, 5's isolated in col4; expected rotates/stacks as connected: 8's and 3's form a snake-like drop across cols1-3, 5's vertical in col4—difference: generated has 8's horizontal at bottom row9 but 3's split, no overhanging.
 * Train5: Generated 9's horizontal at bottom row8, 3's vertical in col3, 6's vertical in col5; expected drops 9's as a connected blob wrapping around 3's and 6's (horizontal in row0 col4, vertical in col2 rows2-4, etc.)—difference: generated keeps 9's flat but positions 3 and 6 wrong, no wrapping connectivity.
 * `fall_down_column` is broken/not helpful—it's column-centric and doesn't handle cross-column connections (avoid in future; replace with component-based dropping).
 * No extraction of objects in attempt, which is essential for identifying rigid blobs—future attempts must include connected component detection to group cells properly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it applies the same flawed per-column gravity, resulting in mostly uniform 5's (background?) filling the grid, with mismatched blobs crammed to the bottom rows (e.g., 8's/3's/4's/9's stacked vertically in cols2-13 row20-21, 1/6 isolated). This ignores connectivity, turning what should be rigid shapes (e.g., horizontal 8's in row19, clustered 3's/4's in row20, 9's in row20) into disconnected vertical piles, similar to training failures. It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected output should preserve blob shapes (e.g., horizontal bars of 4's or 9's dropping as units, possibly interlocking with 8's or 3's without splitting). Without the exact expected test output, it's unclear on precise stacking, but the uniform bottom-filling and shape distortion confirm it's wrong—likely needs component extraction to handle the clustered non-5's (1,3,4,6,8,9) as falling objects.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 2D grid where non-background cells (representing objects or particles of different types/numbers) are subject to gravity, causing them to fall downward toward the bottom of the grid until they reach a stable position. The simulation must account for objects potentially sliding left or right (or diagonally) to settle into the lowest possible configuration, while preserving relative shapes or connections where applicable, resulting in a final "settled" grid that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common number in the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 7 across examples), and only non-background cells move; background cells remain fixed as empty space.
 * Movement is downward due to gravity, but objects do not fall straight down independently—instead, they seem to settle in a way that maintains vertical stacks or connected shapes (e.g., in Training 1, the 4's form a vertical column in col 4, with 2 and 8's adjacent in col 5; in Training 2, numbers like 4, 3, 2 form diagonal or stepped patterns rather than flat piles).
 * Subtle sliding: If directly below is blocked, objects may shift left/right to the nearest empty space below (possibly diagonally), but not arbitrarily—expected outputs show minimal horizontal disruption, keeping objects in roughly their original column ranges (e.g., no excessive leftward drift).
 * Connected components: Objects of the same number may be treated as rigid or semi-rigid blobs that fall together (e.g., in Training 4, the 8's and 3's maintain a zigzag shape when fallen; in Training 5, 9's and 3's stack with 6's below without merging). Different numbers do not merge or block each other unless stacked.
 * Iteration until stable: Simulate steps until no more moves are possible, but process in a way that avoids overwriting or premature blocking (e.g., top-to-bottom row processing can cause chain reactions, but current impl leads to clumping).
 * Edge cases: Grids of varying sizes (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9); empty or all-background grids return unchanged; objects at bottom don't move; multiple object types interact by stacking vertically but not horizontally overlapping unless connected.
 * No rotation or deformation: Shapes drop as wholes or cell-by-cell but end up in expected low-energy states (e.g., Training 3 shows a complex shape with 2's, 7's, 9's spread across cols 6-11 but settled in a tree-like vertical structure).
 * Order of movement matters: Processing from top rows first can cause upper objects to fall and block lower ones incorrectly; diagonal moves (down-left/right) are attempted but over-applied in current code, leading to unwanted sliding.
 * Final stability: No floating objects; everything non-background is at the bottom, stacked from row n-1 upward, with gaps filled by background only where no stacking occurs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This function correctly identifies the background and is essential for distinguishing movable objects from empty space.)

```python
# Potential helpful: Extract connected components (blobs) of same-number cells to treat as rigid units.
# Not implemented in previous attempt, but could prevent cell-by-cell errors.
from typing import Tuple, List

def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    # Returns list of objects, each as [(row, col, value)] for connected same-value cells (4-connected or 8-connected).
    # Use DFS/BFS to find components; skip if not implemented yet.
    visited = [[False] * len(g[0]) for _ in range(len(g))]
    objects = []
    for r in range(len(g)):
        for c in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[r][c] != bg and not visited[r][c]:
                component = []
                stack = [(r, c)]
                val = g[r][c]
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    if visited[cr][cc] or g[cr][cc] != val:
                        continue
                    visited[cr][cc] = True
                    component.append((cr, cc, val))
                    # Add 4-neighbors (up, down, left, right); extend to 8 for diagonals if needed.
                    for dr, dc in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                        nr, nc = cr + dr, cc + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < len(g) and 0 <= nc < len(g[0]) and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                if component:
                    objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This would help identify and move entire blobs rigidly downward, preserving shapes—key for matching expected configurations; current attempt lacks this, leading to disassembly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly detects background (e.g., 0 in Train 1/4/5, 7 in Train 2, 1 in Train 3) and runs an iterative simulation loop until no moves occur, which is a good core structure for gravity.
 * Simulation attempts downward moves (straight or diagonal) if below is empty, which partially captures gravity but over-applies diagonals, causing excessive left/right sliding (e.g., in Train 1, 4's shift left to cols 1-4 instead of staying near col 4-5; in Train 2, 4/3/2 pile flat at bottom instead of stepped verticals).
 * All training examples failed: Train 1 generated a left-clumped pile ([0,4,4,4,4,8,8] in row 6, [0,0,0,0,2,8,8] in row 5) vs. expected vertical stack in cols 4-5 with gaps ([0,0,0,0,4,2,0] etc.); difference is unwanted horizontal compression and no shape preservation—unknown why diagonals caused left bias, but it disrupts columns.
 * Train 2 generated full-background upper rows with bottom pile ([7,7,7,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2] in row 11, etc.) vs. expected sparse vertical/diagonal drops (e.g., 4's in col 4 rows 0-4, 3's stepping down); failed to spread objects, clumping them instead—diagonal moves likely merged them incorrectly.
 * Train 3 generated near-all-background with bottom mess ([1,1,1,1,1,2,2,7,2,2,1,1,1,1] wait, actually [1's] with partial clump in row 16) vs. expected tall vertical structure (2's in col 6 rows 0-6, 7's/9's branching rightward); huge difference in vertical extent and positioning—sim treats cells independently, ignoring connections.
 * Train 4 generated bottom rows with partial clump ([0,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5] in row 9, etc.) vs. expected zigzag verticals (8's/3's alternating cols 2-3, 5's in col 4); failed to alternate positions, stacking horizontally instead.
 * Train 5 generated bottom clump ([9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6] in row 8, [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0] in row 7) vs. expected verticals (9's in col 3 rows 0-4, 3's col 2 rows 2-3, 6's col 5 rows 5-8); again, clumping without column preservation.
 * No training passed, indicating core issue: cell-by-cell movement without blob extraction or proper collision handling leads to disassembly and incorrect settling.
 * The diagonal move logic (down-right/left) is broken/not helpful—intended for sliding but causes over-sliding and bias (e.g., prefers left in some cases); remove or condition it better (e.g., only if straight down blocked and side is lowest).
 * No other functions tried; extract_objects (suggested above) is essential for future attempts to handle connected same-number groups rigidly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it shows a large all-5 background grid (22 cols? assuming n=22 based on lists) with objects (8,3,6,9,4,1) clumped messily in the bottom 4 rows (e.g., row 20: [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,6,8,9,9,9,9,5,...] with horizontal spreading and mixing of types, row 21: [3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,9,9,5,...]), while upper rows are pure 5's.
 * This is incorrect because expected likely mirrors training: objects should fall into distinct vertical stacks or preserved shapes in their approximate original columns (e.g., 8's/3's/4's/1's/9's/6 in separate cols without merging into a flat pile; e.g., 4's might stack in one col, 9's in another, with minimal sliding). The clumping ignores connections (e.g., 9's and 1's should not horizontally blend) and over-slides (similar to training failures), resulting in a non-stable, merged mess instead of separated low positions—does not make sense as a final gravity state, as it looks unstable and shape-destroying.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the background color is identified, non-background connected components (objects of the same color) are extracted, some components are "fixed" and remain in place while others are "moved" or restructured according to spatial rules (possibly shifting toward the right, bottom, or specific alignments while preserving or adapting shapes), and the result is recomposed into a new grid. The goal is to infer and apply rules that match the expected outputs, which often involve relocating or reshaping moving components without overlapping or losing pixels unnecessarily.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color, correctly identified in all examples (e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3), but components must exclude it precisely using 4-connected (up/down/left/right) adjacency, not 8-connected, to avoid merging unrelated pixels.
 * Components are grouped by color, and each color's components are processed separately; multiple components per color exist (e.g., ex1 has separate 2 and 8, ex2 has 2/3/4), but the program treats them individually without merging or ordering by size/color value.
 * Fixed vs. moving distinction is crucial but mishandled: fixed components seem to be those touching specific borders (e.g., top or right in expectations, like vertical stacks on the right in ex1/ex2), while moving ones are relocated (e.g., to the right side or bottom, often vertically aligned but preserving approximate shape or connectivity, not just flattened to a column).
 * Transformations for moving components must preserve pixel count and rough shape (e.g., ex1 expected keeps 4's somewhat vertical on right with 2/8 attached below; ex4/5 show diagonal or L-shapes rotated/flipped to bottom-right), but avoid overlaps by placing in available space (e.g., col4-5 in ex1, not col0); the program's "straighten vertically in leftmost column" loses shape, caps at n pixels (causing truncation), and ignores direction (should be rightward or downward "gravity").
 * Subtle elements: Moving components may rotate 90 degrees (e.g., ex4/5 show horizontal-to-vertical shifts), attach to fixed ones without overwriting (e.g., ex1's 2 between 4 and 8), or stack by color order (low to high? ex2 has 2 at bottom, 3 above, 4 top); grids vary in size (7x7, 12x12, 17x17, 10x10, 9x9), so rules must scale; no pixel loss unless conflict, but program causes loss via capping.
 * Ordering: Components may be placed by color ascending/descending or size, starting from bottom-right (e.g., ex2's 2 spans rows 6-11 in col7, 3 in col4 rows3-5, 4 in col4 rows0-2); fixed ones anchor positions (e.g., ex1's implied fixed 8 stays low-right).
 * Edge cases: Large backgrounds (ex2/3) dominate, small components (ex5's single pixels?); potential overlaps resolved by priority (fixed first, then moving); all pixels must be placed within bounds without wrapping.
 * General: Preserve exact pixel counts per color/component; output must match exactly, including background fills; subtle mismatches like shifted positions (e.g., ex1 generated left-col 4's vs. expected right-col) indicate wrong fixed/moving criteria.

    cols = [c for r, c in component]
    return min(rows), max(rows), min(cols), max(cols)
```
(Helpful for analyzing positions, e.g., to check border touches for fixed/moving.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background and extracts components but fails on fixed/moving classification and transformations, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * is_fixed function is broken: uses min_r <=2 (top-touching) or max_c >=n-2 (right-touching), but in ex1, left-top 4's are generated as fixed (stay left) while expected moves them right; ex2 keeps left structures fixed but expected relocates to center-right; doesn't match subtle border rules (likely top/right fixed, left/bottom moving).
 * transform_moving is unhelpful and incorrect: simplifies to vertical stack in col0 from row0, capping at n pixels (causes loss/truncation, e.g., ex2's long 2 component shortened?); ignores shape preservation, rotation, or right/bottom placement (e.g., ex1 expected vertical on col4-5 with attachments, not col0).
 * keep_fixed is fine but unused effectively due to wrong classification.
 * place_pixels is helpful but overwrites without priority (fixed first needed); causes overlaps or empty spaces in generated (e.g., ex1 has 4/2/8 scattered left vs. expected clustered right).
 * Train 1: Generated keeps 4 vertical left (rows0-5 col0), 2 at row1 col5 (unmoved?), 8 at row3-6 col5; expected moves 4 to col4 rows1-4/col5 row0, 2 at row1 col5 (partial match but shifted), 8 vertical col5 rows3-6 (shape preserved but 4 moved wrong).
 * Train 2: Generated stacks 2/4 vertical left cols0-1, fills rest with 7; expected diagonal-ish placement: 4 horizontal-ish top col4, 3 vertical col3-4 mid, 2 vertical col7 bottom; total mismatch in positions/shapes.
 * Train 3: Generated keeps 9/2 vertical left-top, 7 scattered; expected moves 9/7/2 to bottom-right cluster (rows7-15 cols6-10), 2 vertical col6 rows0-6; ignores vertical extension and relocation.
 * Train 4: Generated keeps 5 vertical left, 3 at row1-2 col2-3? but flattened; expected rotates/shifts 8/3 to top-right L-shape cols2-3 rows0-3, 5 vertical col4 bottom rows4-9; shape and position wrong.
 * Train 5: Generated keeps 6/3 vertical left; expected shifts 9/3 to top-mid cols2-3 rows0-4, 6 vertical col5 bottom rows5-8; again, left-placement vs. right/bottom.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates component extraction but no understanding of movement rules (e.g., why left-to-right shift?); unhelpful functions like transform_moving should be discarded/replaced with shape-preserving shifts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it places components (colors 1,3,8,9 on background 5) as vertical stacks mostly in col0-1 top-to-mid (1 rows0-3 col0, 8 rows1-4 col1-2?, 3 rows4-6 col0, 9 rows7-8 col0), filling rest with 5's, resembling the flawed left-top stacking from training.
 * This mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., should relocate moving components to right/bottom, preserving shapes like diagonals or attachments, not flattening left); for 22x22 grid with colors 1/3/5/8/9, likely expects clustered right/bottom (e.g., 1 fixed top-left?, 8/3 mid-right, 9 bottom), but generated ignores scale and places everything left, causing sparse/wrong layout.
 * No shape preservation (e.g., if input has extended 1's or 5's as background? wait, 5 is bg here); overlaps none but positions all wrong, similar to train failures—does not account for border-touching fixed (e.g., top row 1's might be fixed, but 8/3/9 moved right/down).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the background color (most frequent) is identified, connected components of non-background colors are extracted, "stable" components (strictly vertical lines without gaps) are preserved in place, and non-stable components (any non-vertical or gapped shapes) are repositioned or redistributed in a structured way to form new vertical alignments, possibly simulating sorting, falling, or stacking while conserving pixel counts per color. The goal is to produce a cleaned-up grid with vertical color stacks in specific columns, often shifting non-vertical blobs to form coherent vertical lines in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color overall, used to fill erased areas; non-background colors form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * Stable components are purely vertical: same column, consecutive rows with no gaps (e.g., a straight line from min_row to max_row with exactly max-min+1 cells); any horizontal spread, gaps, or non-straight alignment disqualifies the entire color's components for stability.
 * For stable colors, all components must be vertical to keep the color; if any component for a color is non-vertical, the entire color is treated as unstable and repositioned (not just the bad component).
 * Non-stable colors' pixels are collected entirely (all instances of that color), and their count must be conserved approximately, but repositioned into new vertical stacks, often in dedicated columns, starting from the bottom or in a sequence that matches the original "order" or shape projection.
 * Repositioning non-stables: Not random or diagonal; instead, they seem to "fall" or stack vertically in new columns (e.g., shifting left/right to empty columns, forming L-shapes or diagonals turned vertical), preserving relative ordering of colors from the input (e.g., top-to-bottom or left-to-right scan).
 * Subtle: Outputs often have non-stables forming partial verticals or connected shapes that mimic input blobs but aligned vertically; background fills everything else. Pixel counts per color are exactly preserved. Grids are square (n x n), but components can span partial heights.
 * Edge cases: Single-pixel or short verticals are stable if straight; multi-component colors are stable only if all are vertical. No 8-connectivity—strictly 4. Overwriting only on background; no merging of colors.
 * Conservation: Total pixels per color unchanged, but positions shifted to avoid overlaps and fill from specific starting points (e.g., bottom-up in columns).
 * Common misses: Treating partial verticals as stable when gapped; placing non-stables sequentially without regard to original shape/orientation; failing to shift entire blobs as units rather than scattering pixels.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core issues in repositioning non-stable components.
 * Train 1: Generated placed 4's horizontally in row 0 and scattered 2/8 vertically wrong; expected has 4's shifted to col4 rows1-3 + col5 row0, 2 at row1 col5, 8's vertical in col5 from row3 down—generated ignored original positions for stables and used diagonal for non-stables, mismatching vertical stacking and column choices (unknown why diagonal was chosen, but it scattered instead of stacking).
 * Train 2: Generated kept some 7's but placed 3's/4's horizontally in row0 and vertical 2's in col7; expected has 4's vertical in col4 rows0-2, 3's diagonal-to-vertical in col3-4 rows1-5, 2's vertical in col7 from row5 down—generated treated 3/4 as non-stable and diagonal-placed, losing the partial-diagonal preservation turned vertical.
 * Train 3: Generated placed 2's vertical in col6 rows0-6, 1's scattered with 9's vertical in col9; expected keeps 2's vertical in col6 rows0-6 (correctly stable), but shifts 7's/9's into a connected vertical/diagonal stack starting row6 col7 downward and rightward—generated kept stables but diagonal-placed non-stables (7/9?) in wrong columns, breaking the connected shape.
 * Train 4: Generated placed 8's horizontal in row0, 3's scattered vertical in col2, 5's vertical in col4; expected has 8/3 forming a diagonal snake turned into verticals in cols 1-3 rows1-3, 5's vertical in col4 from row4 down—generated scattered 8/3 as non-stables on diagonal instead of preserving blob connectivity as vertical stack.
 * Train 5: Generated 9's horizontal row0, 3's vertical col3 rows2-3, 6's vertical col5 rows5-8; expected 9/3 as diagonal verticalized in cols2-3 rows0-4, 6's vertical col5 rows6-8—similar scattering issue, diagonal placement overwrote wrong positions without forming original blob's vertical projection.
 * Function `place_non_stable_as_diagonal` is broken/not helpful: It sequentially fills from top-left diagonal, ignoring original shapes/columns, leading to horizontal spreads and wrong counts/placements; do not use in future—replace with vertical stacking in shifted columns.
 * `keep_stable_components` works partially (preserves true verticals like 2's in train3, 6's/5's in trains4-5) but fails when non-stables overwrite or when partial verticals are misclassified.
 * `find_components` and `is_vertical_component` are essential and correct for extraction/stability check.
 * Overall: Stable detection works for clear verticals but repositioning fails entirely—non-stables need to be reformed as vertical stacks in sequential empty columns (e.g., left-to-right), preserving pixel order from input scan (row-major) or blob centroids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows massive horizontal spreads of 8's/9's/3's/4's/5's in row0-1, then huge vertical blocks of 5's filling most of the grid (rows2-17), with 6/1 scattered at bottom— this appears as over-placement of 5's (likely background or dominant non-stable flooded wrongly) and ignores vertical stacking, resulting in a mostly uniform 5-block with misplaced singles, unlike expected patterns in training (compact vertical color stacks in specific columns without flooding). It scatters non-stables horizontally/diagonally per the flawed function, losing all shape preservation; does not make sense as it violates pixel conservation per color (5's dominate unnaturally) and fails to form coherent verticals—must account for sequential column assignment for non-stables (e.g., place each color's pixels vertically in next available column from bottom, preserving input order) to handle large/complex tests.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells where the background color (most common) is identified, connected components (blobs) of non-background colors are detected using 8-connectivity, certain blobs (those larger than 3 cells and not straight horizontal or vertical bars) are "erased" to background, and the erased cells are then repositioned—likely falling under gravity to stack vertically from the bottom or align with remaining "fixed" structures (bars or small blobs)—while preserving color counts and overall structure integrity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color (e.g., 0 in Train 1/4/5, 7 in Train 2, 1 in Train 3, 5 in test); non-background colors form blobs via 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals), which allows for irregular shapes but must distinguish straight bars correctly.
 * Erase only blobs >3 cells that are NOT bars; bars (perfect horizontal or vertical lines with no gaps or extras) are "fixed" and not erased, serving as supports; small blobs (<=3) or bars remain untouched.
 * After erasure, fixed components (remaining non-background blobs) are sorted by their minimum row (top-to-bottom order); erased colors must be re-placed by "falling" them downward, stacking vertically in their original column centroids or aligned to supports, without diagonal/slanted placement—reconstruction should mimic gravity where blobs drop straight down until hitting bottom or a fixed structure.
 * Subtlety: Connectivity is 8-way, so diagonal touches count as connected (e.g., in Train 3, the 7-9-7 structure spans rows/cols irregularly); bars must be strictly linear (consecutive cells in one row/col, no branches or gaps)—the is_bar function checks this but fails if positions aren't sorted/contiguous properly.
 * Erased cell counts per color must be exactly preserved and placed as single vertical stacks or reformed blobs, often in the original centroid column; avoid scattering or diagonal insertion, as this breaks vertical alignment seen in expectations.
 * Grids are square (n x n), but components may not span full width/height; handle empty rows/cols; after placement, no overlaps with fixed parts or background-only spaces unless filling gaps vertically.
 * Easy to miss: In expectations, erased parts often shift left/right slightly to align under supports (e.g., Train 1: 4's stack in col 4 under implied support, 2/8 in col 5); re-placement isn't always in exact original columns but adjusted for stability; test case has large background (5) with scattered small blobs, suggesting multiple erasures and vertical drops.
 * All attempts failed due to incorrect re-placement logic: diagonal/stepped insertion instead of straight vertical drops, leading to misaligned stacks; extra "vertical attach above upper left" and "remaining at bottom" code overcomplicates and scatters cells.

(Useful for identifying remaining supports after erasure; sorts by min row for ordering, but current sorting key assumes non-empty.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to flawed re-placement: instead of vertical gravity drops, code inserts erased cells diagonally/stepped between fixed components (e.g., using delta_c for direction and j* direction), leading to slanted lines rather than straight stacks.
 * Train 1: Generated scattered 4's across cols 2/4/5 in rows 0-5 with 2 in row1 col5 and 8's vertical in col5 but offset; expected vertical 4-stack in col4 (rows1-3,0? wait row0 col5=4, but mainly col4/5 alignment for 4/2/8); difference: extra left 4's not erased properly, no left-shift to col4, 2/8 not stacked cleanly under support—unknown why 4's didn't consolidate vertically.
 * Train 2: Generated 3's vertical in col3 rows0-2/7-11? and col4 row3, 4's scattered, 2's in col7 rows5-11 but with extras; expected 4/3's in col4/3 descending to row1-5, then 3/2 in col6/7 rows5-11 vertical; difference: too many 7's (bg) misplaced as fills, 3's not shifted right to col3/4 properly, 2's extended upward incorrectly—no vertical drop from original positions.
 * Train 3: Generated tall vertical 7/2 in cols5/6 rows0-6, then scattered 7/9/7 lower; expected horizontal-ish 2's in col6 rows0-5, then 7 vertical col6 row6, 7/9/7 L-shape rows7-16 cols7/9/10; difference: over-erased and re-stacked 2's/7's as single verticals instead of preserving multi-color connections, 9's not aligned rightward—8-connectivity caught blobs but bar detection failed for partial lines.
 * Train 4: Generated 3's zigzag in col3 rows1-3, 8/5 vertical in col2/4 rows4-9; expected 8/3 zigzag but shifted left in cols3/2/1 rows0-3, then 8/5 vertical col3/4 rows4-9 but 5 shifted left to col4 only lower; difference: 3's not zigzagged correctly (stayed too right), 8's didn't shift left under 5, 5's over-extended horizontally—suggests centroid calc wrong for small blobs.
 * Train 5: Generated 9's scattered in cols1-3 rows0-4/6?, 3's in col3 row2, 6's vertical col5 rows5-8; expected 9's vertical in col4 rows0-4 but split around 3's in col3, 6's vertical col5 rows5-8 but shifted left? Wait, expected has 9's in col3/4 mixed, 3's col3 rows2-3, 6 col5; difference: 9's not reformed as vertical stack in col4, extra 9's left, 3's not connected properly—erasure hit wrong components.
 * Main program logic unhelpful: Erasing works partially (counts erased), but placement (diagonal between fixed, extra above-left attach, bottom dump in centroid) scatters cells instead of dropping vertically per column; sorting fixed_comps by min_r is good but delta_r/delta_c calc leads to slants; original_centroids for bottom placement is conceptually ok but executes after flawed main placement.
 * get_connected_components and is_bar are helpful/accurate for extraction but not for re-placement; overall attempt shows understanding of erasure rules but fails core gravity/re-stacking.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows massive background (5) in top 7 rows, then a horizontal 3-bar in row8 cols0-6, scattered single 4's descending diagonally in rows9-12 cols3/4/5/6, then mixed 8/4/6/1/9 in rows14-20 cols3/7/8/11/12 in a stepped/diagonal pattern, with no vertical stacking—resembles the code's flawed diagonal insertion rather than expected vertical drops (e.g., 3's should stack at bottom in original cols, 4's/8/6/1/9 form clean verticals under supports without slants). This ignores gravity, leaving top empty and bottom cluttered/misaligned; likely over-erased most blobs (assuming many >3 non-bars), then placed remnants slanted between few fixed parts—does not match training expectations of aligned vertical stacks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where non-background colors (treated as "objects" or blobs) are rearranged into vertical stacks within the grid, likely simulating gravity or consolidation rules, while preserving the background (most common color, often 0 or 7 or 1 or 5) and avoiding overlaps. The goal appears to be grouping each color into a single vertical column based on some positional heuristic (e.g., average or median column of original positions), then stacking instances of that color contiguously from the bottom of the grid upward, but the exact ordering of colors and stacking direction/start point is critical and not fully captured.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is correctly identified as the most frequent value (e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test), and all non-background positions are cleared to it before repopulating.
 * Each non-background color is treated as independent "objects" or instances, collected by their original positions; the number of instances per color must be preserved exactly (e.g., four 4's, one 2, four 8's in ex1).
 * Column selection for stacking seems based on original positions of that color (e.g., average column works partially but fails when positions are spread out, as in ex1 where 4's avg to col2 but should be col4; perhaps use median column or leftmost/rightmost instead to better match expected clustering).
 * Stacking is vertical (same column for all instances of a color), but direction and starting point are wrong: current code stacks from the minimum original row upward (top-down), leading to mid-grid or top placements (e.g., 2 at row1 in ex1, 9's starting mid in ex3); expected often stacks from the bottom upward (gravity-like, filling from row n-1 down to cover exactly k rows where k=count of color).
 * Overlaps occur when multiple colors average to the same column (e.g., 4 and 8 both trying col5? in ex1 generated, but code overwrites sequentially); expected avoids this by assigning distinct columns or adjusting positions (e.g., ex1 uses col4 for 4's and col5 for 2/8, with 2 floating higher).
 * Subtle ordering: Colors may need to be processed in a specific sequence (e.g., by color value ascending/descending, or by original appearance order) to resolve column conflicts; in ex2, 4's and 3's interleave slightly before full stacking, suggesting partial horizontal preservation or blob connectivity.
 * Blobs/connectivity: If same-color adjacent cells form "blobs," they might need to be treated as single units (e.g., in ex4, 3's are stacked but shifted left; generated treats individually, leading to col2 for 3's but expected col3 with diagonal flavor); however, examples suggest individual cells, not strict blobs, but adjacency might influence column choice.
 * Grid size varies (7x7 in ex1/3, 12x12? in ex2, 10x10 in ex4, 9x9 in ex5, 22x22? in test with 22 elems/row), so n=len(g) is essential; ensure placements stay within bounds (0 <= r < n, 0 <= c < n).
 * Edge cases: Single-instance colors (e.g., 2 in ex1) don't stack but may "float" higher than full stacks (row1 vs bottom); empty colors or all-bg grids return unchanged.
 * No rotation, mirroring, or horizontal movement beyond column selection; output must match expected exactly, including 0/bg positions.
 * Potential miss: In ex3, 2's stack top-to-mid in col6, 7's shift right/down to col7 rows6-12 then col9-10, 9's at col9 rows9-11 with 7 below; suggests column assignment might prioritize original median col and stack from bottom, but with color ordering affecting overlaps (e.g., place lower colors first).
 * In ex5, diagonal-like preservation (9 and 3 interleave in cols 2-3) hints at not fully collapsing to single column per color—perhaps stack in original columns but drop down vertically per column independently (simple gravity per column), but that fails ex1 (would keep 4's scattered).

    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

    positions = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != bg:
                positions.setdefault(c, []).append((i, j))
    return positions
```
```python
def compute_column_for_color(positions: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    """Computes a column for stacking; current avg, but consider median: sorted_cols = sorted(j for _, j in positions); return sorted_cols[len(sorted_cols)//2]"""
    if not positions:
        return 0
    cols = [j for _, j in positions]
    return sum(cols) // len(cols)  # Avg; alternative: min(cols) or max(cols) for edges
```
(Note: The clear_and_place logic in the original program is partially helpful but broken due to top-down stacking and no conflict resolution; avoid sequential overwriting without checks.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions/tools:**
 * The stacking loop in the original program (`for idx in range(k): r = min_row + idx; grid[r][avg_col] = c`) is broken: uses min_row (top-biased) instead of bottom-up (e.g., r = n - 1 - idx), causes overlaps without checking if cell is free, and doesn't handle color ordering.
 * Flat list creation is redundant if using row/col loops; Counter on flat is fine but not essential beyond bg.
 * No blob extraction (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) was attempted, but it might be irrelevant since examples treat cells individually; don't pursue unless diagonals suggest otherwise (unproven).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly identifies bg and collects per-color positions, which is a core step, but fails all training due to wrong stacking mechanics.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 2 at row1 col5 (partial match for position but wrong height), 4's at rows3-6 col2 (wrong col, overwrites potential space, should be col4 rows1-4 with offset), 8's at rows3-6 col5 (correct col but overwrites 2's space and starts too high; expected has 8's bottom 4 rows col5, 4's shifted left, 2 higher in col5).
 * Train 2: Generated repeats 4's top 3 rows col4 (close but no interleaving with 3's at col3), then 3's mid-bottom col4 (overwrites), 2's bottom col7 (partial col match); expected has 4's col4 top, 3's col3 rows1-2 then col4 bottom-up with gaps, 2's col7 bottom—mismatch in interleaving and full bottom-stacking.
 * Train 3: Generated 2's top-mid col6 (correct col but too many rows? wait, stacks 7 times but count=7?), 7's mid-bottom col10 (wrong col, should shift to col7 then col9), 9's bottom col9 (correct col but overlaps 7's); expected preserves top 2's stack, shifts 7's right/down in steps, 9's mid with 7 below—suggests non-overwrite placement order by row or color.
 * Train 4: Generated 3's rows1-3 col2 (wrong col and top-start), 8's rows4-8 col2 (overwrites 3's, wrong col), 5's rows4-8 col4 (partial col but overlaps); expected spreads 8/3 diagonally left in cols2-3 top-mid, then 5's bottom col4—mismatch indicates possible per-column gravity with horizontal shift for connections.
 * Train 5: Generated 3's rows2-3 col3 (correct col but mid, not top-diagonal), 9's row5 col1 (wrong col), 6's rows5-8 col5 (partial col); expected diagonals 9/3 in cols2-3 rows2-3, then 9 row4 col3, 6 bottom col5—suggests preserving relative horizontal positions while dropping vertically.
 * Overall: Avg column heuristic works for some (e.g., 8's col in ex1), but fails spread-out colors (4's in ex1); top-down stacking causes mid/top placements vs expected bottom-up; no overlap resolution leads to overwrites (e.g., multiple colors in col3 ex test); individual cell treatment ignores potential blob/diagonal preservation.
 * extract_objects equivalent (positions dict) is essential for grouping; without it, can't isolate colors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows messy mid-grid stacking with overlaps and top-biased placements (e.g., 8's rows1-3 col3, 9's rows4-12 col11, 3's rows8-13 col3 overwriting 8's, 6 at row17 col7, 4/1 at row19-21 col4/8), leaving top/bottom mostly bg=5 but no clear vertical consolidation per color.
 * It mismatches expected patterns from training (e.g., no bottom-up full stacks, colors like 8/3/9 crammed in few columns with overwrites, 4/1/6 not dropped fully); likely wrong because column avgs cluster too many (8/3 in col3), stacking starts high (e.g., 8's at row1 vs bottom), and no ordering to space out columns (e.g., 9 at col11 far right, but test input likely has spread positions).
 * To handle test, need bottom-up stacking (r = n - k + idx or n-1 - idx), median col instead of avg for outliers, place colors in sorted order (e.g., by min color value) with column adjustment if occupied, and check for per-column gravity alternative if diagonals persist.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a puzzle simulating gravity in a 2D grid where non-background cells of the same value form connected components that fall downward (increasing row index, assuming row 0 is top), stacking on the bottom or other components, similar to match-3 games like Candy Crush or Puyo Puyo, but with evidence of a removal step for matched groups (3+ connected same value) after falling, as cell counts decrease in some examples (e.g., example 1: 6 to 4 for value 4; example 4: 6 to 5 for value 8).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are groups of same-value non-background cells; the attempt uses 4-connected (up/down/left/right), but examples suggest 8-connected (including diagonals) may be needed for proper grouping and potential matching, as seen in expected diagonal chains (e.g., example 2 3's form a diagonal line).
 * Gravity is downward (vertical drop only in the attempt, but examples show possible sideways shifting or sliding when blocked, e.g., example 1 4's shift right to col4-5; example 4 8's/3's shift left to col1-3).
 * Processing order is critical: sort by lowest point (max row) descending to drop bottom components first, avoiding interference; the attempt does this correctly, but fails because rigid-body drop doesn't account for irregular shapes (e.g., protruding bases hit bounds before upper parts fall).
 * Drop mechanics: Components fall as rigid bodies until blocked, but the attempt's one-row-at-a-time check fails for shapes where min fall distance is 0 due to bounds/overlaps; need to compute max uniform shift k where all shifted positions are in-bounds and empty (after clearing old), then shift by k.
 * Removal step likely after falling: Remove groups of 3+ connected same value (possibly 8-connected), then re-apply gravity to remaining cells above; this explains cell count reductions (e.g., example 1 likely removes some 4's after they connect; example 3/2/5 no removal as groups <3 or not triggering). Subtle: Removal may chain (multiple iterations until no matches).
 * Background is most common value (works in attempt); empty space is background.
 * Grid orientation: Row 0 top, higher rows bottom; drop increases row indices.
 * No rotation or color change; preserve all non-removed cells.
 * Subtle: If no space below entire component, it stays; upper components fall onto lowered ones.
 * Per-cell falling (independent per column) doesn't fit examples (e.g., example 1 4's would stack in original columns, not shift right).
 * After removal, gaps cause above cells/components to fall further.
 * All examples require multiple components interacting (e.g., 2 falls onto 8's in example 1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify background as most common value."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This works well for identifying bg, e.g., 0 in ex1/4/5, 7 in ex2, 1 in ex3, 5 in test.)

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]]:
    """Find 4-connected components of same non-background value using flood-fill."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Change to 8-connected: add (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                value = g[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == value:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if component:
                    components.append((component, value))
    return components
```
(Flood-fill for components is essential and correct, but switch to 8-connected for matching/diagonal connections; used successfully for identification, but drop fails after.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
The `drop_one_row` and `drop_component` functions are broken for irregular shapes: they attempt incremental 1-row drops but fail immediately if any part (e.g., base protrusion) hits bounds/overlaps, preventing any movement (e.g., ex1 4's can't drop due to row6 parts going to row7). Do not use in future; replace with max-shift calculation. No removal function exists, causing cell count mismatches where expected removes matches.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Successfully identifies background and finds connected components via flood-fill, but 4-connected misses diagonal connections needed for full grouping/matching (e.g., ex2 3's diagonal chain).
 * Sorting components by max row descending (lowest first) works conceptually to avoid upper components blocking lower drops.
 * Rigid-body vertical drop fails for non-rectangular shapes: whole component shifts only if all parts can move equally, but irregular bases hit bottom/bounds first (e.g., ex1 4's L-shape base at row6 prevents drop, output unchanged; similar in ex4 8's/3's).
 * No sideways sliding: expected shows lateral movement when vertical blocked (e.g., ex1 4's shift right to col4-5; ex4 8's/3's shift left, forming snake-like stack).
 * Missing removal step: After drop, connected groups of 3+ same value (likely 8-connected) should be cleared, causing cell count drop (e.g., ex1 generated 6 4's vs expected 4; ex4 generated 6 8's vs 5), then re-drop remaining; without this, outputs retain all cells and don't match.
 * In ex2, partial drop happens (e.g., 2's stack at bottom col7, 4's/3's shift left/up), but not fully (3's/4's not diagonal-stacked correctly; no removal, but counts match as no trigger).
 * In ex3, no drop (generated = input, components at bottom can't move), but expected has 2's stacked left in col6 rows0-6 (top?), 7's/9's shifted right/down in diagonal (suggests left gravity or rotation? but inconsistent; unknown why 2's move up/left).
 * In ex5, no drop (generated = input), expected has 9's/3 shifted up/left, 6's down, suggesting per-component slide + drop.
 * Train 1 mismatches 4's positions/shift (stays left-bottom vs expected right-stacked near top with partial removal); 2/8 stack wrong (2 not on 8's with gap).
 * Train 4 8's/3's stay right-bottom vs expected left-diagonal stack + removal of 1 8.
 * Function `drop_component` is incorrect (incremental fails rigid check; doesn't compute max k or handle slide/removal; don't use).
 * No chaining: After removal, need re-find components and re-drop (missing in all, causes static outputs).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears unchanged from likely input (all components at bottom rows 17-21, no drop possible under rigid vertical rules, top filled with bg 5), but expected should show dropped/stacked components at bottom (higher rows) with possible left/right shifts (e.g., 3's/4's horizontal groups may stack vertically in cols, 8's cluster fall together, 9's shift, 1's/6 single may fall independently), potential removals (e.g., 3's 7 connected >3, remove all; 4's 6 connected, remove; 9's 8 connected, remove; leaving 8's,1's,6 to stack), and re-drop. Without shifts/removal, it ignores interactions (e.g., 1's vertical may fall onto 5's? but bg; 6 single falls). Accounts for large bg 5 (most common), but no movement indicates failed gravity simulation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers) on a background, where the goal is to detect and erase "invalid" large connected components that aren't simple bars (straight horizontal or vertical lines), then restore the exact number of erased pixels for each affected color by placing them in strategic positions to connect, extend, or bridge between remaining "fixed" components, effectively completing or correcting incomplete shapes while preserving bars and small components.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color; all other colors are potential shapes/objects.
 * Connected components use 8-connectivity (including diagonals), so shapes can be diagonally adjacent.
 * "Bars" are strictly contiguous straight lines: either all in one column (vertical, consecutive rows) or one row (horizontal, consecutive columns); anything larger than 3 pixels that's not a bar gets fully erased.
 * Erased colors are restored exactly N pixels (original count), but only if there was at least one large non-bar component for that color; placement prioritizes sorted fixed components (by min row), focusing on upper/lower pairs.
 * Bridging logic: Calculate delta_r (row gap) and delta_c (column shift) between upper component's bottom and lower component's top; use linear interpolation (round(k * abs(delta_c) / delta_r)) for slanted bridges; handle cases where upper_num <= lower_num (left-attach + upper extension) vs. else (lower vertical extension + mirror).
 * If no bridge needed (delta_r <=0) or <2 fixed components, fallback to simple vertical placement (e.g., left/right of a single component).
 * Filler colors are sorted by value for ordered placement; candidates are sets to avoid duplicates, sorted by (row, col) for sequential filling.
 * Subtle edge cases: Handle out-of-bounds, already-filled cells (skip if not bg), rounding in averages/positions, sign of delta_c for direction, and when bridge_col is offset (e.g., -1). No placement if no candidates or N=0.
 * Grids can be rectangular (rows x cols), but examples are square-ish; empty grids return unchanged.
 * Potential misses: Over-erasing if components are misidentified as non-bars; incorrect bridge slopes if delta_r=0 or small; ignoring small components (<4 pixels) which stay fixed; not handling multiple upper/lower pairs or non-vertical gaps well; placement might overlap or skip due to sorting.

(Variant for all remaining non-bg components post-erasure; key for finding anchors to attach/bridge to.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handles background detection, component extraction, bar identification, and erasure of large non-bars, as shown by passing training examples 1, 3, and 5.
 * It demonstrates core bridging logic for connecting upper/lower components, including slanted interpolation and conditional extensions/attachments based on component sizes.
 * However, in training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated output places a vertical stack of 3's in column 3 (rows 0-3) and keeps 4's misplaced, while expected has 4 at row0 col4, 3's horizontal in rows1-2 cols3-4, and a 3 at row5 col6 before the 2's bar; the generated ignores the need for horizontal shaping and bridge adjustment, resulting in vertical over-placement (effect: extra 3's in top-left, missing horizontal extension for 3/4 and the row5 3).
 * In training example 4 (INCORRECT): Generated keeps 8's vertical in column 1 (rows1-4,6-7?) but places 3's incorrectly, while expected has 8's more spread (row0 col3, row1 col2, row2 col1, row3 col2, row4 col3) forming a diagonal-ish shape, with 3's adjusted; effect: generated fails to bridge/extend 8's properly across the gap to connect to 5's, keeping them too vertical and clustered left (missing the zigzag or slanted restoration).
 * The fallback placement (for <2 components) works in simple cases but over-relies on vertical stacking, which mismatches expected horizontal or offset placements in examples 2 and 4.
 * Sorting fixed_comps by min row is helpful for upper/lower pairing but misses multi-pair or horizontal-dominant scenes.
 * Bridge calculation with round(sum/len) for averages is good for centers but can misalign if components are asymmetric (e.g., in ex4, 8's need more diagonal shift).
 * Candidate set union (attach + bridge + ext) avoids overlaps, but sorting by (row,col) may prioritize top-left too aggressively, filling wrong spots first.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the complex conditional logic in placement (e.g., do_left_attach, mirror_num) is brittle and overfits vertical bridges, failing slanted/horizontal needs in failed examples.
 * Overall, erasure and counting N work well (preserves pixel totals), but placement candidates are insufficiently flexible for non-vertical gaps or when delta_c is large.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules inferred from training; it erases and restores some elements (e.g., 3's bar in row8 cols0-6, vertical 4's descending from row9 col4 to row15 col7, then 8's/6/1's in lower right), but the slanted progression of 4's and isolated 6 at row18 col7 suggest incomplete bridging—likely meant to connect a upper shape (possibly the 3's) to lower ones (1's?), but the 8's at row16-17 col7-8 and single 6 seem like a failed interpolation (effect: abrupt 6 instead of smooth slant, and 1's vertical in col8 without attachment to above).
 * Compared to training failures, this mirrors ex4's issue: vertical bias in placement (4's stack down-right) instead of expected diagonal/horizontal restoration to match shape continuity; the all-5 top (rows0-7) implies heavy erasure, but restoration starts too late/low, missing potential upper extensions.
 * Without explicit expected, it partially makes sense (total pixels per color likely match N), but the disjoint lower elements (6/8/1) indicate missed subtle diagonal connectivity or mirror extension, making it incorrect for a complete shape.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between properties/components that appear **in EVERY train puzzle** (1 through 5). I focused only on patterns that hold across all 5 without exception, ignoring any that are absent in even one example (e.g., hole count changes only occur in train 2 and 3, so excluded; pixel conservation per color holds in 4/5 but has a discrepancy in train 1, so excluded as not fully consistent). No attempts to explain or infer the underlying puzzle rule or full transformations—only direct, observable connections are noted. Where a connection involves an unexplainable aspect of transformation, it is called out as unknown. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., backgrounds, static large shapes without interaction, inconsistent behaviors) are excluded.

#### 1. **Color → Transformation Type (Movement or Stability)**
   - **Description**: The color of a shape consistently determines whether it undergoes transformation (e.g., position shift, splitting into same-color components) or remains stable. Shapes of the same color behave similarly across examples, while different colors show distinct behaviors.
   - **Observed Interactions**:
     - Yellow: Undergoes position transformation (often involving lower y-coordinates in bbox) in train 1; stable if already at low y in train 2.
     - Green: Undergoes position transformation (often to lower y-coordinates) in train 2 and 5; stable in train 4.
     - Light Blue: Undergoes position transformation (to lower y-coordinates) in train 5; stable in train 3.
     - Maroon: Undergoes position transformation (to lower y-coordinates, with splitting into same-color 1-pixel components) in train 1 and 4.
     - Red: Stable (no position or splitting change) in train 1, 2, and 3.
     - Dark Red: Undergoes transformation (splitting and/or position shift) in train 2 and 3.
     - Pink/Orange/Blue: Stable (no change) where present (train 4 for Orange, train 5 for Pink, train 3 for Blue).
   - **Consistency Note**: This holds in all 5 trains—no shape changes color, and transformation type (move/split vs. stay) is tied to its original color. Unknown: Exact mechanism of how color triggers specific transformation details (e.g., direction or split pattern).

#### 2. **Position (BBox) → Transformation (Movement Direction or Stability)**
   - **Description**: The initial bbox position of a shape interacts with its transformation, where shapes at certain positions (e.g., already at minimal y=0 or edge-aligned) tend to remain stable, while others shift. This interacts with color (above) but is independently observable via bbox changes.
   - **Observed Interactions**:
     - Shapes with low initial min-y (e.g., y=0 or y=1) in bbox often remain stable or undergo minimal change (e.g., Yellow at [4,0,4,2] in train 2; Red at [6,0,6,6] in train 3; Greens at low y in train 4).
     - Shapes with higher initial min-y (e.g., y≥3) in bbox undergo position shifts, often to lower y-values (e.g., Yellows from y=3+ to y=0/1 in train 1; Greens from y=5+ to y=1-5 in train 2; Light Blues from y=5+ to y=0-5 in train 5; Maroons from y=4+ to y=0-4 in train 4).
     - x-position shifts occur alongside y-changes for some (e.g., clustering toward higher x in train 1; horizontal split in train 2 for Dark Red; diagonal spread in train 3 for Dark Red), but y-interaction is more consistent.
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in all 5 trains—every example has at least some shapes whose bbox changes based on initial position, with no counterexamples of high-y shapes staying unchanged without transformation. Unknown: Why some position shifts are vertical-only vs. diagonal/horizontal, or exact threshold for "low y" stability.

#### 3. **Component Count (Per Color) → Same-Color Splitting**
   - **Description**: When a color's components undergo transformation, the number of same-color components can increase via splitting (e.g., one multi-pixel shape becomes multiple smaller ones of same color and total pixels roughly matching original), but this is triggered by position/color (above). Isolated components (no interaction) do not split.
   - **Observed Interactions**:
     - Yellow: Splits implicitly via position change in train 1 (5px +1px → 3px +1px, though total pixels discrepant).
     - Green: Splits into more 1-2px components during position shift in train 2 (three components → four).
     - Dark Red: Splits large/multi into multiple small same-color components in train 2 and 3 (e.g., 129px with holes → two separate; 9px total → seven 1-3px).
     - Maroon: Splits into multiple 1px components during position shift in train 4 (6px total → six 1px).
     - Light Blue: Splits into more 1-2px components during position shift in train 5 (6px total → five components).
   - **Consistency Note**: In all 5 trains, transforming colors (per #1) show component count changes via same-color splitting where multi-pixel shapes are involved; non-transforming colors (e.g., Red, Orange, Pink) have no splitting. No cross-color splitting. Unknown: Precise split logic (e.g., into 1px vs. 2-3px) or why train 1 has pixel discrepancy post-split.

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., involving holes, silhouettes/edges, or direct shape-to-shape effects like adjacency) appear in every train example—such patterns are sporadic or absent in some (e.g., no holes in trains 1, 4, 5). These listed connections do not explain full transformations (e.g., exact new bbox calculations remain unknown).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 03:23:24] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where some components or "objects" appear to be partially or fully "erased" (overwritten with background color), and the task is to restore or reconstruct the missing parts by identifying fixed (non-erased) structures, erasing invalid components, and filling gaps with "bridges" or fallback placements that match the original shapes, positions, and connections in the expected outputs. The restoration must preserve object shapes, alignments (e.g., vertical/horizontal bars), and connectivity while avoiding overlaps or incorrect interpolations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color; non-background colors form connected components (8-connected) that can be bars (straight horizontal or vertical lines) or more complex shapes.
 * Erase entire colors if they contain any large (>3 pixels) non-bar components, treating them as "erased" and tracking their total pixel count for later restoration—this works for identifying what to remove but fails in precise repositioning.
 * Fixed components are remaining non-background blobs after erasure (color-blind, 8-connected); sort them by topmost row to establish vertical order for bridging gaps between them.
 * Bridges between upper and lower fixed components use linear interpolation for column positions (based on min columns of components), placed in rows between them (up to N pixels, where N is erased count), shifting left if occupied by background check only (not other colors), with fallback vertical placement below the gap if needed; this often misaligns (e.g., wrong starting columns, over-placement, or ignoring shape continuity).
 * For remaining erased colors after bridging, fallback to vertical placement below the last fixed component in its center column, or row-major at top if no fixed components—these fallbacks ignore original alignments and create disconnected or shifted blobs.
 * Subtlety: Bars are strictly straight (consecutive rows/cols, same row/col), but complex shapes (e.g., L-shapes or diagonals) trigger erasure if >3 pixels; however, expected outputs show restorations that maintain non-bar shapes, suggesting erasure criteria might be too aggressive or bridging must reconstruct exact shapes, not just counts.
 * Gaps are assumed vertical (between sorted components), but examples show horizontal/diagonal connections needed (e.g., slanted bridges or shape mirroring).
 * Pixel counts must be exactly restored (N=total erased for that color), but placement must avoid overwriting fixed parts and match expected positions (e.g., right-aligned in ex1, slanted in ex4).
 * Edge cases: Grids with all-background or no gaps; large grids (17x22 in test) where interpolation fractions cause rounding errors; components touching edges or overlapping potential bridge paths.
 * Color order: Sorted by color value for erasure/processing, but restoration may need original appearance order (top-to-bottom).
 * Connectivity is 8-way, but bars are 4-way strict; non-bar detection misses subtle bends (e.g., 2-pixel jogs).
 * Overwriting only checks background, allowing bridges to overwrite fixed components unintentionally (though code avoids it partially).

These functions are helpful for background detection, component extraction (per-color and fixed), and bar checking, as they correctly identify structures in inputs.

```python
def get_component_min_c(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    """Get minimum column of component."""
    return min(c for r, c in comp)

def place_bridge(g: List[List[int]], upper_comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], lower_comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], color: int, N: int, bg: int, n: int) -> None:
    """Place bridge pixels using linear interpolation, shifting left if occupied."""  # (incomplete in original, but concept for interpolation)
    # ... (as in provided code; helpful for gap-filling idea but buggy in execution)

def place_fallback(g: List[List[int]], fixed_comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], color: int, N: int, bg: int, n: int) -> None:
    """Place pixels vertically below the fixed component in center column."""
    # ... (as in provided code; useful for last-resort placement but often misaligns)
```
These are somewhat helpful for bridging/fallback logic but need fixes for accurate positioning (e.g., better interpolation, shape matching).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall approach erases large non-bar components correctly (identifies what to restore) but fails to reconstruct positions/shapes accurately across all training examples.
 * Train 1: Erased color 4 correctly (large non-bar), but bridge placement put 4's too left (col4 instead of col5) and extended 8's upward (rows 3-5 instead of 4-6); extra 4 in row0 col4 overwrote expected empty; 2 placed correctly but isolated.
 * Train 2: Erased 3 and 4 as non-bars, but restored 3's and 4's in wrong columns (e.g., 4's vertical in col4 rows0-2 instead of slanted col4-5; top 4 in row0 col4 missing); 2's correct but bridge ignored slant.
 * Train 3: Identified components but erased too much (e.g., kept vertical 7-2 bar but misplaced 7's horizontally in rows0-4 cols5-6 instead of col6 only; 9's vertical in col9 but expected slanted with 7's); lower 7's and 9's shifted right/down; ignored diagonal connections.
 * Train 4: Erased 3 and 8 as non-bars (correct count), but placed 3's vertical in col3 instead of slanted cols2-3; 8's horizontal in row0 col3 instead of slanted cols1-3 rows0-3; 5's untouched but bridge started wrong.
 * Train 5: Erased 9 and 3, placed 9's in wrong positions (vertical col2-4 instead of slanted cols2-4 rows0-4); 3's at row2 col3 only (missing row3); 6's correct but disconnected from bridge.
 * Sorting fixed components by min row works for vertical order but assumes all gaps are vertical bridges—misses horizontal/slanted restorations.
 * Interpolation in place_bridge uses min_c but rounds poorly (e.g., fraction=k/(num_possible-1) causes left shifts); shifting left only if bg but doesn't check full path occupancy.
 * Fallback vertical below last comp ignores original horizontal/diagonal needs, creating straight lines where bends expected.
 * Bar detection strict (no bends), but some expected shapes are near-bars (e.g., L in ex4); >3 threshold erases valid complex objects prematurely.
 * Color sorting for restoration processes in numerical order, but examples suggest top-to-bottom or shape-priority order.
 * get_all_positions and components extraction are accurate for counting but not for shape reconstruction.
 * No handling for multi-component colors or overlapping bridges; erased_colors list assumes one erased per gap, but multiples possible.
 * Function place_bridge is helpful for concept but broken (wrong start_row calc, places beyond gap, ignores upper/lower max/min rows properly); place_fallback unhelpful for non-vertical cases (creates mismatches in ex1, ex3).
 * is_bar functions are correct and helpful for validation but too rigid—consider relaxing for 1-2 pixel bends.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it fills most of the grid (22x22?) with background 5, erases a horizontal bar of 3's in row8 cols0-6 (likely a non-bar or large component), then places scattered single pixels or short lines of 4's (rows12-16 cols0-5, slanted?), 6 at row17 col7, and vertical 1's in col8 rows18-21— this seems like over-erasure (almost entire grid blanked except bottom) and poor bridging (scattered instead of connected shapes). It mismatches puzzle intent, as expected outputs in training restore coherent objects (e.g., slanted lines, bars) without blanking large areas; likely erased too many components (e.g., treating fixed bars as erasable) and fallback-placed remnants at bottom without alignment to any "gaps," creating disconnected pixels where connected structures should be. No sense of original input structure (test input not shown, but output implies heavy erasure); to handle test, need better non-erasure criteria (e.g., preserve small bars) and shape-aware bridging (e.g., match min/max rows/cols from erased positions).

[2025-10-02 03:23:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
