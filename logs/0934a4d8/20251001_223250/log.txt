=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 22:32:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 22:42:14] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x30 grid of digits (0-9) where regions bounded by 8s represent areas to process or decode, likely by extracting, transforming, or filtering patterns within those regions to produce a smaller output grid that matches expected patterns. The goal is to identify rules for mapping or aggregating grid values, possibly involving symmetry, periodicity, or mode-based selection, but the current approach fails to reproduce the expected outputs consistently across training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The 8s likely define a bounding rectangle or frame for the relevant region, but the output size (e.g., 9x4 in training 1, 4x5 in training 2) suggests the output dimensions are derived from the region's height/width minus the frame or via some other rule like excluding borders.
 * Non-8 values inside the region need aggregation, but simple mode over all or subsets doesn't work; expectations show structured patterns (e.g., repeated rows or symmetric elements) that suggest rules like copying from specific offsets, mirroring, or conditional replacement based on neighboring values.
 * Periodicity or modular grouping (e.g., grouping rows/cols by mod height/width) is attempted but overcomplicates and fails, producing uniform or incorrect modes (e.g., all 9s in large areas of training 1 where variety like 6,4,2 is expected).
 * Subtle elements: Outputs can have irregular shapes/sizes per example (not always square), and expectations preserve some original structure (e.g., diagonals or borders in training 1) while altering interiors; ignore 8s entirely in output, but their positions might imply rotations, shifts, or exclusions.
 * Grids may have multiple disconnected 8 regions or noise outside, so bounding box must be tight; outputs seem to focus only on the 8-bounded area, ignoring the full 30x30.
 * Mode selection takes the smallest candidate if ties, which might miss ties resolved by position or value priority; empty vals default to 0, but expectations rarely use 0, suggesting no empties or different defaults.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs aren't direct crops (e.g., training 1 expected has 9s on borders but internals differ); possible rules involve averaging, majority in windows, or pattern matching (e.g., replace based on adjacency to 8s).
 * Across attempts: No handling for varying region sizes/orientations; assumes single rect, but examples might need multiple or non-rect processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_eights_rect(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """
    Finds the minimal bounding rectangle containing all 8s in a 30x30 grid.
    Useful for isolating the puzzle region, as 8s likely frame the area of interest.
    Returns (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col); assumes 8s form a connected frame.
    """
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = 30, -1, 30, -1
    for r in range(30):
        for c in range(30):
            if g[r][c] == 8:
                min_r = min(min_r, r)
                max_r = max(max_r, r)
                min_c = min(min_c, c)
                max_c = max(max_c, c)
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
```

```python
def get_mode(vals: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode of a list, returning the smallest value in case of ties.
    Helpful for aggregation, but current usage (over mod groups) is flawed; may need weighting or positional bias.
    """
    if not vals:
        return 0  # Default; expectations suggest avoiding 0, so adjust if empties occur.
    count_dict = {}
    for v in vals:
        count_dict[v] = count_dict.get(v, 0) + 1
    max_count = max(count_dict.values())
    candidates = [k for k in sorted(count_dict) if count_dict[k] == max_count]
    return candidates[0]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies the 8-bounded rectangle using find_eights_rect, which works as a starting point for region isolation in all examples.
 * Modular grouping via get_mod_lists attempts to capture periodic patterns (e.g., repeating every h rows), but this is unhelpful and broken—it produces overly uniform outputs (e.g., large blocks of 9s in training 1) by cartesian-product sampling, ignoring local structure.
 * Mode aggregation over grouped positions fails entirely: In training 1, generates repetitive 9/4/5 blocks and a mismatched bottom row [9,9,9,3] vs expected varied [9,4,3,9], suggesting mode doesn't capture the symmetric/repeated row patterns like [9,9,6,4].
 * Training 2: Output has alternating 4/7/2 but expected has 3/1/4/6/5 with different repetitions (e.g., row 1 [3,1,4,4,4] vs generated [4,7,2,7,7]), indicating no recognition of clustered values or border preservation.
 * Training 3: Short 3-row output with 7/6/4/2/9, but expected has 7-row height with 3/4/6/9 patterns; generated misses height derivation and produces invalid uniformity (e.g., many 7s where 9s/6s expected).
 * Training 4: 4x4 output with symmetric 6/1 but expected irregular [6,9,6,6] etc., showing failure to handle non-square or asymmetric interiors; mod approach creates false symmetry.
 * Overall, the program assumes output size = region size and fills via mod-mode, which doesn't work; no extraction of non-8 subgrid first, leading to vals including scattered 8s? Wait, code excludes 8s, but still mismatches.
 * get_mod_lists is not helpful—it's overly complex for periodicity and causes sampling of irrelevant distant positions (e.g., wraps around grid, pulling in outside noise).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond the mod ones; find_eights_rect and get_mode are salvageable but need better application (e.g., mode over local windows instead).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x3 grid with heavy repetition of 7/4/9/2/6/1 (e.g., columns mostly 7s on left/right, 4/9 in middle; rows like [7,7,2] repeated with variations), which looks patterned but overly uniform and symmetric, suggesting the mod-mode approach is again producing artifacts rather than meaningful decoding.
 * It does not look correct: Expectations likely need more variety/irregularity (based on training failures, e.g., not all borders 7s, internals should mix like 1-9 without mod-induced blocks); for instance, row 5 [4,7,7] and row 8 [4,7,4] seem like false modes from grouping, missing potential shifts or direct mappings seen in training (e.g., preserved edges).
 * Without the actual test grid, can't confirm exact expected, but given all trainings wrong, this probably mismatches by ignoring subtle rules like adjacency or excluding frame thickness—output feels "generated" not "puzzle-solved," with no clear relation to expected structured outputs.

[2025-10-01 22:42:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
