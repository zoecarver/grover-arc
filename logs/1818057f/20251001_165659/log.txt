=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:57:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (primarily 2's and 4's) where the task is to detect specific plus-shaped patterns formed by 4's and replace those positions with 8's in the output grid, while leaving other cells unchanged. The program processes the input grid by identifying all such plus patterns and filling them accordingly, based on a rule that targets non-edge positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The plus pattern is strictly defined as five 4's: a horizontal line of three 4's in row r at columns c-1, c, c+1, plus vertical extensions at (r-1, c) and (r+1, c); no diagonals or larger extensions are included.
 * Patterns must be fully within grid bounds (r and c not on edges, specifically 1 <= r < h-1 and 1 <= c < w-1), preventing invalid checks or overflows.
 * Overlapping plus patterns are possible and should all be detected and filled independently; since filling sets to 8 and original patterns are 4's, overlaps will simply set to 8 multiple times without issue.
 * The output starts as a copy of the input grid, ensuring unchanged cells remain as-is (e.g., 2's stay 2's unless part of a plus).
 * Detection is based solely on the original input grid (not the modified output), avoiding interference from prior fills.
 * Subtlety: No merging or expansion of patterns; each plus is isolated, and isolated 4's or incomplete shapes (e.g., missing vertical arm) are not filled.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; single-row/column grids have no valid centers, so return unchanged; patterns cannot touch grid edges.
 * All cells are integers (2 or 4 in examples), but code assumes general List[List[int]] without validation for other values.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_plus_pattern(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if there is a plus pattern centered at row r, column c.
    The pattern consists of a horizontal line of three 4's at row r, columns c-1 to c+1,
    and single 4's above at r-1,c and below at r+1,c.
    """
    h = len(grid)
    if h == 0:
        return False
    w = len(grid[0])
    if not (1 <= r < h - 1 and 1 <= c < w - 1):
        return False
    return (grid[r][c - 1] == 4 and
            grid[r][c] == 4 and
            grid[r][c + 1] == 4 and
            grid[r - 1][c] == 4 and
            grid[r + 1][c] == 4)
```

```python
def fill_plus_pattern(output: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> None:
    """
    Fills the plus pattern centered at row r, column c with 8's in the output grid.
    Fills the five positions: (r-1,c), (r,c-1), (r,c), (r,c+1), (r+1,c).
    """
    output[r - 1][c] = 8
    output[r][c - 1] = 8
    output[r][c] = 8
    output[r][c + 1] = 8
    output[r + 1][c] = 8
```

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Applies the plus pattern filling rule to the input grid.
    Detects all plus patterns based on original grid and fills them with 8's.
    """
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return []
    w = len(g[0])
    output = [row[:] for row in g]
    for r in range(1, h - 1):
        for c in range(1, w - 1):
            if has_plus_pattern(g, r, c):
                fill_plus_pattern(output, r, c)
    return output
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt fully implements the plus detection and filling logic, correctly passing all three training examples by identifying and replacing exact plus patterns with 8's while preserving the rest of the grid.
 * What worked: Boundary checks prevent errors; detection on original grid handles potential overlaps correctly; shallow copy ensures input integrity.
 * What didn't work: None identified in training, but potential issue if test input has overlapping or adjacent pluses that create unintended 8's in non-pattern areas (though logic seems robust).
 * No prior unhelpful functions; all provided functions (has_plus_pattern, fill_plus_pattern, program) are essential and correctly modularize detection vs. modification.
 * No extraction of broader "objects" needed, as the puzzle focuses on fixed-shape pluses rather than variable blobs or connected components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows 8's placed in several plus-shaped regions (e.g., rows 1-2 cols 1-3: vertical and horizontal 8's; rows 2-3 cols 1-3: full plus; similar patterns around rows 6-7 cols 11-13, rows 7-8 cols 1-3 and 11-13, etc.), which align with visible pluses of 4's in the input if mentally tracing (e.g., input has horizontal 4's in row 2 cols 1-3 with verticals above/below).
 * Overall, the test output makes sense and appears correct: 8's are confined to exact plus positions without spillover, 2's and unfilled 4's remain unchanged, and patterns like the one at row 7 cols 11-13 (horizontal 4's with verticals) are properly filled; no obvious mismatches or extras observed.
 * Subtle check: Some areas (e.g., row 12 cols 6-8) show 8's that match a plus, but denser 4-clusters (e.g., row 12 cols 0-11) might tempt over-filling—however, only exact pluses are hit, so no incorrect 8's in lines or blocks.
