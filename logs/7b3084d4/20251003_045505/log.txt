=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 04:55:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 05:46:01] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 05:46:40] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of a Python program with a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs, likely involving object extraction, pattern recognition, and output generation for training examples and a test case. The goal is to correctly interpret puzzle rules on grids to produce matching outputs, but the previous attempt failed fundamentally due to structural issues in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The program must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail with an error, regardless of logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid representations (e.g., List[List[int]]) where cells represent visual elements like shapes, blobs, holes, or dividers.
 * Key rules may include identifying and extracting objects (e.g., counting holes, matching shapes, omitting invalid objects), handling edge cases like partial stretches or mismatches in blob shapes.
 * Subtleties: Ensure outputs match exact expected formats for training examples (e.g., specific strings or structures); account for unknown mismatches like blob shape errors; consider grids where components don't span fully.
 * All considerations: Prioritize function presence over logic; test mentally by simulating rules on inputs; avoid unhelpful code structures that don't integrate with the required function.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions were successfully generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the core 'program' function.
# Placeholder for future: A basic grid processor.
def process_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    # Extract objects, apply rules, return output string.
    return "processed_output"
```

```python
# Potential type for puzzle elements, not used in attempt but could help structure extractions.
class GridObject:
    def __init__(self, shape: str, holes: int, position: tuple):
        self.shape = shape
        self.holes = holes
        self.position = position
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt generated code without a 'program' function, causing all training examples and the test to fail with identical errors.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were produced beyond errors; zero progress on puzzle logic like object extraction or rule application.
 * Missed the fundamental requirement of including a 'program' function, which supersedes any internal logic.
 * No extraction functions were present or helpful; any potential tools (e.g., for blobs or holes) were absent.
 * All training examples failed identically, indicating a complete structural breakdown rather than puzzle-specific issues.
 * The attempt demonstrates no understanding of integration with the evaluation system.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense as a valid result—it indicates a code generation failure, not a puzzle solution.
 * No actual puzzle output was generated, so it cannot be compared to expected results; this is incorrect because the test requires a functional program to produce a specific output based on the input grid.
 * Without the 'program' function, the test case cannot be processed, missing any application of rules like object omission or shape matching.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 05:46:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: No placement found
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 06:05:52] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (blobs) of the same color from an irregular input grid and rearranging them into a compact n x n square output grid, where n is determined by the total number of non-zero cells forming a perfect square. Components are placed without overlapping, in a specific order, potentially after rotating them 90 degrees clockwise up to three times, prioritizing placements that start as top-left as possible in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes like polyominoes with diagonal links.
 * Total non-zero cells across the entire input must exactly equal n^2 for some integer n; otherwise, it's invalid (though the program raises an error for non-perfect squares).
 * Sorting components: By decreasing maximum row index (favoring components that extend furthest down in the input, i.e., "bottom-heavy" first), with ties broken by decreasing color value— this order determines placement sequence and is crucial for correct reconstruction.
 * Placement: For each component, compute its bounding box height h and width w, normalize positions relative to the top-left of the bounding box, and try placing it (and its 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° rotations) in the output grid by scanning from top-left (smallest row pr, then smallest column pc) for the first empty spot that fits the entire relative shape without overlap. Rotations are 90° clockwise, and after each rotation, re-normalize to the new bounding box top-left.
 * Subtleties: Rotations change the bounding box dimensions (e.g., a tall thin shape becomes wide after 90°), so all orientations must be tried to find the "best" (earliest top-left) fit; if no orientation fits anywhere, it fails. The output starts fully empty (zeros), and placed cells take the component's color. Input may have empty rows/columns or disconnected parts, but all non-zero cells must be used. Potential issues: Overly strict "first fit" placement might block later components if sorting or rotation normalization doesn't align with puzzle intent (e.g., components might need to be placed in a way that minimizes wasted space beyond just top-left priority). Diagonal connectivity means some "separate" visual blobs might merge unexpectedly. The program assumes input is square-sized but only uses non-zero cells for n.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Component extraction via DFS/stack with 8-directional search; identifies same-color connected groups and marks visited to avoid duplicates.
dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]  # 8 dirs for connectivity

def extract_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # (Full DFS logic as in program: iterate grid, start stack from unvisited >0 cell, flood-fill same color, collect positions)
    # Returns list of (color, list of (r,c) positions) for all components.
    pass
```

```python
# Rotation function: 90° CW, then normalize to bounding box top-left.
def rotate_90_cw(rel_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    new_pos = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in rel_pos]  # CW rotation formula
    if not new_pos:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, c in new_pos)
    min_c = min(c for r, c in new_pos)
    normalized = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in new_pos]
    new_h = max(r for r, c in normalized) + 1
    new_w = max(c for r, c in normalized) + 1
    return normalized, new_h, new_w
```

```python
# Placement finder: Scans output grid row-by-row, col-by-col for first empty fit of relative positions.
def get_best_placement(rel_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int, output_grid: List[List[int]], n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (Logic as in program: nested loops over pr (0 to n-h), pc (0 to n-w), check all rel_pos fit empty (==0))
    # Returns best (pr, pc, rel_pos copy) or invalid if none found.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt analyzed; it successfully extracted components using 8-dir DFS, computed correct bounding boxes and relative positions, implemented 90° CW rotations with normalization, and attempted ordered placement with top-left priority across orientations.
 * What worked: Passed Training example 3 completely (correct output grid generated and matched expected), indicating core component extraction, sorting (by max row desc then color desc), rotation, and placement logic are viable for some cases—likely when components fit neatly without tight space constraints.
 * What didn't work: Failed Training examples 1 and 2 with "No placement found" error, meaning after placing earlier components, later ones (in some orientation) couldn't find an empty bounding box fit anywhere in the output; this suggests the greedy top-left-first placement might leave fragmented space that doesn't accommodate later shapes' bounding boxes, even if raw cells would fit (bounding box overhead wastes space). Similarly failed test input with same error, implying the test has similar tight-packing issues (e.g., irregular shapes or order causing blockages). Sorting by max row might not always prioritize "largest" or "base" components correctly for all inputs, leading to suboptimal early placements.
 * The get_best_placement function is helpful but overly rigid: it stops at the absolute first (pr, pc) across all rotations without considering if a later rotation might enable better overall packing (though it picks the best rotation per component via sorting candidates by (pr, pc, rotation_index)).
 * Rotation logic is correct (CW 90° formula and re-normalization), but trying only up to 270° (4 orientations) is exhaustive and fine; however, for symmetric shapes, it redundantly tests equivalents.
 * Visited matrix prevents re-processing cells, which is essential and worked in the passing case.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the candidate sorting (min pr, min pc, min k) assumes lower rotation index is better on ties, which might be arbitrary and not puzzle-intent (e.g., if puzzle prefers minimal rotation).

**Test output:**
 * The test output resulted in an ERROR - Execution error: No placement found, which does not look correct and indicates failure to complete the rearrangement—the program couldn't place at least one component after others, leaving the output incomplete or ungenerated.
 * This differs from expectations because a valid solution should produce a full n x n grid with all input non-zero cells placed (colored) without overlaps or gaps in the used cells, matching some target visual pattern; the error means the placement strategy (greedy top-left with rotations) likely fragmented the output space, blocking a later component's bounding box despite total cells fitting n^2 (e.g., a long thin component placed early might leave no rectangular-ish empty region for a later irregular blob).
 * Unlike Training 3 (which succeeded, implying the test shares some structure but has additional constraints like tighter interleaving of components or shapes requiring non-greedy placement), the test failure highlights that the approach doesn't handle all cases—possibly the test requires considering reflections (not just rotations) or a different sorting/priority (e.g., by size or min row instead of max row) to avoid deadlocks.
 * Observed effect: Program runs until a component can't place, then raises ValueError—instead of expected full grid, no output is returned, confirming it's broken for this input (unknown exact test grid, but error implies packing inefficiency).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 06:05:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring the generation of a Python program with a mandatory 'program' function to process grid-based inputs, likely involving object extraction, pattern recognition, and output generation for training examples and a test case. The goal is to correctly interpret puzzle rules on grids to produce matching outputs, but the previous attempt failed fundamentally due to structural issues in the code.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The program must include a top-level 'program' function; without it, all evaluations fail with an error, regardless of logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves grid representations (e.g., List[List[int]]) where cells represent visual elements like shapes, blobs, holes, or dividers.
 * Key rules may include identifying and extracting objects (e.g., counting holes, matching shapes, omitting invalid objects), handling edge cases like partial stretches or mismatches in blob shapes.
 * Subtleties: Ensure outputs match exact expected formats for training examples (e.g., specific strings or structures); account for unknown mismatches like blob shape errors; consider grids where components don't span fully.
 * All considerations: Prioritize function presence over logic; test mentally by simulating rules on inputs; avoid unhelpful code structures that don't integrate with the required function.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions were successfully generated in the attempt, as the code lacked the core 'program' function.
# Placeholder for future: A basic grid processor.
def process_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    # Extract objects, apply rules, return output string.
    return "processed_output"
```

```python
# Potential type for puzzle elements, not used in attempt but could help structure extractions.
class GridObject:
    def __init__(self, shape: str, holes: int, position: tuple):
        self.shape = shape
        self.holes = holes
        self.position = position
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt generated code without a 'program' function, causing all training examples and the test to fail with identical errors.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were produced beyond errors; zero progress on puzzle logic like object extraction or rule application.
 * Missed the fundamental requirement of including a 'program' function, which supersedes any internal logic.
 * No extraction functions were present or helpful; any potential tools (e.g., for blobs or holes) were absent.
 * All training examples failed identically, indicating a complete structural breakdown rather than puzzle-specific issues.
 * The attempt demonstrates no understanding of integration with the evaluation system.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense as a valid result—it indicates a code generation failure, not a puzzle solution.
 * No actual puzzle output was generated, so it cannot be compared to expected results; this is incorrect because the test requires a functional program to produce a specific output based on the input grid.
 * Without the 'program' function, the test case cannot be processed, missing any application of rules like object omission or shape matching.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving extracting connected components (blobs) of the same color from an irregular input grid and rearranging them into a compact n x n square output grid, where n is determined by the total number of non-zero cells forming a perfect square. Components are placed without overlapping, in a specific order, potentially after rotating them 90 degrees clockwise up to three times, prioritizing placements that start as top-left as possible in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes like polyominoes with diagonal links.
 * Total non-zero cells across the entire input must exactly equal n^2 for some integer n; otherwise, it's invalid (though the program raises an error for non-perfect squares).
 * Sorting components: By decreasing maximum row index (favoring components that extend furthest down in the input, i.e., "bottom-heavy" first), with ties broken by decreasing color value— this order determines placement sequence and is crucial for correct reconstruction.
 * Placement: For each component, compute its bounding box height h and width w, normalize positions relative to the top-left of the bounding box, and try placing it (and its 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° rotations) in the output grid by scanning from top-left (smallest row pr, then smallest column pc) for the first empty spot that fits the entire relative shape without overlap. Rotations are 90° clockwise, and after each rotation, re-normalize to the new bounding box top-left.
 * Subtleties: Rotations change the bounding box dimensions (e.g., a tall thin shape becomes wide after 90°), so all orientations must be tried to find the "best" (earliest top-left) fit; if no orientation fits anywhere, it fails. The output starts fully empty (zeros), and placed cells take the component's color. Input may have empty rows/columns or disconnected parts, but all non-zero cells must be used. Potential issues: Overly strict "first fit" placement might block later components if sorting or rotation normalization doesn't align with puzzle intent (e.g., components might need to be placed in a way that minimizes wasted space beyond just top-left priority). Diagonal connectivity means some "separate" visual blobs might merge unexpectedly. The program assumes input is square-sized but only uses non-zero cells for n.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Component extraction via DFS/stack with 8-directional search; identifies same-color connected groups and marks visited to avoid duplicates.
dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]  # 8 dirs for connectivity

def extract_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    # (Full DFS logic as in program: iterate grid, start stack from unvisited >0 cell, flood-fill same color, collect positions)
    # Returns list of (color, list of (r,c) positions) for all components.
    pass
```

```python
# Rotation function: 90° CW, then normalize to bounding box top-left.
def rotate_90_cw(rel_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int, int]:
    new_pos = [(c, h - 1 - r) for r, c in rel_pos]  # CW rotation formula
    if not new_pos:
        return [], 0, 0
    min_r = min(r for r, c in new_pos)
    min_c = min(c for r, c in new_pos)
    normalized = [(r - min_r, c - min_c) for r, c in new_pos]
    new_h = max(r for r, c in normalized) + 1
    new_w = max(c for r, c in normalized) + 1
    return normalized, new_h, new_w
```

```python
# Placement finder: Scans output grid row-by-row, col-by-col for first empty fit of relative positions.
def get_best_placement(rel_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, w: int, output_grid: List[List[int]], n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    # (Logic as in program: nested loops over pr (0 to n-h), pc (0 to n-w), check all rel_pos fit empty (==0))
    # Returns best (pr, pc, rel_pos copy) or invalid if none found.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single attempt analyzed; it successfully extracted components using 8-dir DFS, computed correct bounding boxes and relative positions, implemented 90° CW rotations with normalization, and attempted ordered placement with top-left priority across orientations.
 * What worked: Passed Training example 3 completely (correct output grid generated and matched expected), indicating core component extraction, sorting (by max row desc then color desc), rotation, and placement logic are viable for some cases—likely when components fit neatly without tight space constraints.
 * What didn't work: Failed Training examples 1 and 2 with "No placement found" error, meaning after placing earlier components, later ones (in some orientation) couldn't find an empty bounding box fit anywhere in the output; this suggests the greedy top-left-first placement might leave fragmented space that doesn't accommodate later shapes' bounding boxes, even if raw cells would fit (bounding box overhead wastes space). Similarly failed test input with same error, implying the test has similar tight-packing issues (e.g., irregular shapes or order causing blockages). Sorting by max row might not always prioritize "largest" or "base" components correctly for all inputs, leading to suboptimal early placements.
 * The get_best_placement function is helpful but overly rigid: it stops at the absolute first (pr, pc) across all rotations without considering if a later rotation might enable better overall packing (though it picks the best rotation per component via sorting candidates by (pr, pc, rotation_index)).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
