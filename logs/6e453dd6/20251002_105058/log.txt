=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 10:50:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:56:12] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid divided by a vertical "separator" column of 5s, where connected components of empty spaces (0s) on the left side are shifted rightward to align against the left edge of the separator (effectively "pushing" them to the right wall), solids (non-0s except 5s) block movement, and the right side of the grid is conditionally filled with 2s based on whether the left side has uninterrupted empty paths reaching the separator in each row.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The separator column (all 5s) divides the grid into left (columns 0 to s-1) and right (s+1 to end); the 5s themselves are not modified.
 * Connected components of 0s are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) and only considered on the left side (columns 0 to s-1 inclusive); they do not wrap around or include the separator or right side.
 * Shifting: Each component is shifted right by the distance from its rightmost cell to the left edge of the separator (s-1), but only if the shift is positive; original positions are marked as 6 (possibly indicating "moved" or filled), and new 0s are placed only if they fit within the left side (no spillover to separator or right).
 * Subtlety: Shifts are per-component, so multi-row components move as a unit, preserving shape; if a component already touches s-1, no shift occurs (shift=0).
 * Right-side filling: Only process rows where the cell immediately left of the separator (grid[row][s-1]) is 0 (i.e., an empty path reaches the separator wall).
 * In such rows, identify the leftmost 0 (min0) in columns 0 to s-1; then check if the segment from min0 to s-1 is entirely 0s (uninterrupted empty block to the wall).
 * If not entirely 0s (i.e., interrupted by non-0 solids in that segment), fill the entire right side (s+1 to end) with 2s for that row; if uninterrupted, leave right side unchanged (no 2s).
 * Easy to miss: The check for "solid" is inverted in logic—it's actually checking for "empty" (sets solid=False if any non-0 found, so "not solid" means interrupted empties, triggering 2s); also, zeros_cols only looks at 0 to s-1, but s is excluded as it's 5s.
 * Components ignore 6s, 2s, etc.—only 0s are empties; after shifting, new 0s might create new configurations, but the code applies shifts first, then right-side logic on the updated grid.
 * Edge cases: Empty components (no shift); rows with no 0s on left (skip); components spanning multiple rows must move rigidly; right side only fills per-row independently, not as components.
 * Post-shift, the grid may have 6s as "trailers" or filled voids from moved components.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt presented; it correctly handles training examples 1-3 by properly identifying the separator, finding and shifting left-side 0-components rightward (marking trails as 6s), and applying right-side 2-filling only for rows with interrupted empty paths to the separator.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is robust for multi-row shapes; shift calculation aligns components precisely to s-1 without overlap or spillover; right-side logic correctly skips rows not reaching the wall and only fills on interruptions.
 * What didn't work: None explicitly for training (all correct), but potential issues in test: The apply_shifts places 6s in original positions even if shift=0 (though code skips if shift<=0, so originals remain 0—wait, code only acts if shift>0, preserving unshifted 0s correctly).
 * Subtle bug in apply_shifts: If shifted new_c > left_end (unlikely since shift = left_end - max_col <= left_end - 0), but code checks <= left_end; however, if component max_col <0? No, cols start at 0.
 * The right-side function's "solid" naming is confusing (inverts intent: not solid means fill 2s), but logic is correct for detecting interruptions post-shift.
 * Overall, demonstrates core understanding: movement as rigid components, wall-pushing, and conditional flooding based on reachability with blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 24-row grid (rows 0-23) with separator at column 8 (5s there), left side mostly 6s with some shifted 0s and 6s, and right side (columns 9-11) mostly 6s but with 2s in specific rows (e.g., row 13: 2s in 9-11; row 17: 2s; row 19: 2s; row 23: 2s).
 * It looks mostly correct: Left side has patterns like vertical stacks of 0s shifted right (e.g., rows 2-5 show 0s pushed to columns 3-7 against wall at col7), originals filled as 6s; untouched rows all 6s.
 * Specific effects: In rows with post-shift 0 at col7 (s-1=7), right-side logic applies—e.g., row 13 has 0s at col4 and col7 but 6s at col5-6, so interrupted (min0=4, but col5=6 !=0), triggers 2s on right, which matches output.
 * Similar for rows 17,19,23: Interruptions (e.g., isolated 0s or gaps) cause 2s, while uninterrupted rows (e.g., row 2: 0s from col3-7 all 0s post-shift? Wait, output row2: 0s col3-7, yes no 2s).
 * One potential issue: Row 5 has 0 at col7 but output shows no 2s, implying uninterrupted from its min0—looks correct; row 6 has 0 at col7, no 2s, correct if solid empty block.
 * Overall, test output makes sense and appears correct based on rules: 2s only in rows with 0 at col7 but interrupted empties leftward; no 2s where full empty block to wall or no reach; left shifts preserved shapes (e.g., row9-11 pattern shifted).
 * No obvious mismatches, but without expected output, can't confirm 100%; however, patterns align with puzzle logic (e.g., no spillover, rigid moves).
