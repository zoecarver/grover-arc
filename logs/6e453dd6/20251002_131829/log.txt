=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 13:18:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving manipulation of patterns in a left section (filled with 6's and 0's) relative to a fixed column of 5's acting as a divider, where "blocks" of rows with 0's are processed by shifting non-6 patterns rightward based on minimum trailing space in the block, filling with 6's, and conditionally filling right-side cells with 2's if the shifted pattern reaches the divider and contains internal 6's within its span.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a vertical "divider" column entirely filled with 5's; all processing is confined to columns left of this (0 to c-1) and potentially right of it for 2's placement.
 * "Blocks" are maximal consecutive rows with at least one 0 in the left section; rows without any 0's in left are skipped and remain unchanged.
 * For each block, compute "trailing" as the number of non-zero (implicitly 6's) cells after the last 0 in a row's left section; m is the minimum trailing across all rows in the block that have 0's.
 * Shifting: For each row in the block with 0's, shift the entire span (from first to last 0 position, including any internal non-0's like 6's) right by shift = min(m, row's own trailing), placing it into a new left section filled with 6's elsewhere.
 * Subtlety: The shift preserves the exact values in the original span (0's and any internal 6's or others), but only if there are 0's; the span length is end - start + 1, capturing gaps.
 * 2's placement: Only if the shifted span ends exactly at c-1 (touches divider) AND the original span had at least one 6 in its range (start to end, which could include gaps); then fill from c+1 to width-1 with 2's (but code starts from c+1, skipping the 5).
 * Easy to miss: Blocks must skip initial rows without 0's but include all consecutive with any 0; if no 0's in a row within block, skip shifting that row.
 * Trailing calculation assumes left section ends at c-1; if no 0's in row, trailing isn't computed for that row.
 * Potential issue: If span has gaps (e.g., 0's with 6's in between), internal 6's trigger 2's only if shifted to edge; unchanged right side unless 2's set.
 * Grid may have varying patterns like consecutive 0's or isolated; output must copy input exactly except for modified left and conditional right.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid or no 5 column returns input unchanged; blocks at start/end; rows with 0's only at edge (trailing=0).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No separate reusable classes or functions defined beyond the main program; the program itself embeds block detection and shifting logic.
# Core logic for block finding (consecutive rows with any 0 in left) is helpful and worked for training.
# Trailing min computation across block rows with 0's is key for determining global shift limit m.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt shown; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying the 5's column, detecting blocks, computing min trailing m, shifting spans rightward with 6-fills, and applying 2's where shifted span touches divider with internal 6's in original span.
 * What worked: Block detection skipped non-0 rows properly; shifting preserved pattern lengths and values (including gaps); 2's only triggered on edge-touch with internal 6 condition, matching training expectations.
 * What didn't work: In test output, shifting appears inconsistent across similar blocks (e.g., some rows like [6,6,6,6,0,6,6,0,5,2,2,2] have partial shifts and 2's, but others like [6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,5,6,6,6] remain unshifted or minimally changed despite being in potential blocks; many rows show no shift at all, suggesting block boundaries or trailing calcs failed for multi-row patterns with varying 0 placements.
 * Test-specific issues: 2's appear in rows like 13,17,19,23 but not consistently in similar patterns (e.g., row 13 has 0's at positions 4 and 7, shifted with 2's, but row 4 [6,6,6,0,6,0,6,6,5,...] shows no shift); output has redundant unchanged rows, and some blocks seem merged or skipped incorrectly.
 * The has_internal_6 check may be buggy: It scans original span for 6's, but since span is min-max of 0 positions, it includes gaps where 6's could be, which is correct per subtlety, but in test, it triggers 2's unevenly (e.g., row 13 has 6's in gaps, gets 2's, but similar row 4 doesn't shift at all).
 * No unhelpful functions; the embedded logic for zero_positions and new_left creation is helpful but needs refinement for consistent block processing in test (e.g., perhaps trailing should consider only after last 0, but code does c-1 - end, which is correct if end is max zero pos).
 * Overall, training success shows core shifting and 2's logic is sound, but test reveals gaps in handling complex block with interspersed full-6 rows or varying trailing mins.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (some shifts and 2's appear where edge-touching with internals occur, e.g., rows with isolated 0's near end get 2's like row 13/17/19/23), but does not look fully correct overall—many rows with clear 0 blocks (e.g., rows 2-5 with consecutive 0's in cols 3-7) show minimal or no shifting, remaining close to input, while isolated patterns shift unevenly; this differs from expected uniform block processing where all rows in a block should align to min trailing m, resulting in synchronized right-shifts across the block.
 * Specifically, expected: Rows 2-5 (assuming c=8, left 0-7) form a block with varying trailings (e.g., row 2 trailing ~0, row 3 ~1?); m small, so all should shift right by m, filling left with 6's and preserving 0 patterns; but output shows row 2 unchanged [6,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,5,...], row 3 partial [6,6,6,0,6,0,6,6,5,...] no shift, row 4 unchanged, row 5 [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,...] minor. This mismatch suggests block detection or per-row shift calc failed for dense 0 rows.
 * Another difference: Lower blocks (e.g., rows 8-11, 16-21) have similar issues—some get 2's (rows with 0 at 7 and internal 6's?), but others don't shift, leading to asymmetric output; expected more consistent alignment to block's m, and 2's only on qualifying rows post-shift.
 * Rows 0,1,6,7,12,15,21,24 appear fully unchanged (all 6's left +5), which is correct if no 0's, but interspersed blocks aren't fully processed.
 * Overall, test output is incomplete/incorrect because it doesn't demonstrate full block synchronization—shifts are sporadic, not block-wide, making the grid look unaligned compared to what training success implies (uniform shifts per block).
