=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:02:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 00:12:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if (c != bg and
                g[r][k + 1] == c and
                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 00:24:13] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle.

    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if (c != bg and
                g[r][k + 1] == c and
                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:37:52] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 00:38:01] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically across **every** train example (no exceptions). I focused only on elements with clear, repeated interactions (e.g., via position adjacency, color influence, or property changes like pixel count or bbox expansion). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background black areas, which are never listed) are excluded. Inconsistent or sporadic patterns (e.g., specific directions of expansion, creation of single-pixel components in non-Maroon colors) are not included, as they do not occur in every example. If a transformation cannot be clearly linked to an interaction without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Maroon (Large Component with Holes >0) → Multiple Maroon (Small Components with Holes=0)**
   - **Interaction**: The single large Maroon component in every input (with holes >0, covering a broad bbox like [0,0,N,N] and high pixel count, e.g., 51–523 pixels) consistently splits into multiple smaller Maroon components in the output (all with holes=0, smaller bboxes, and lower individual pixel counts, e.g., 1–92 pixels each).
   - **Connection Properties**:
     - **Holes**: Input holes (>0) are eliminated; all output Maroons have holes=0 (consistent property transformation).
     - **Pixel Count**: Total Maroon pixels decrease (e.g., train 1: 523 → ~487; train 2: 51 → 42; train 3: 362 → ~317; train 4: 131 → 123), with conservation of overall image pixels when combined with other colors.
     - **Position (bbox)**: Input bbox is subdivided; output Maroons fill gaps around other components but avoid direct overlap with non-Maroon bboxes.
   - **Affected By**: Position of all non-Maroon components (see below); the splitting is always bounded by their bboxes.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every train; no exceptions. The exact splitting rule (e.g., how bboxes are divided) is unknown, as it varies by input layout.

#### 2. **Green Components (Holes=0) ↔ Maroon (No Change or Expansion)**
   - **Interaction**: All Green components (holes=0, small bboxes, low pixel counts like 1–11) remain completely unchanged in the output, acting as static barriers that prevent Maroon from overlapping their exact positions. No new Green components are created, and existing ones do not absorb or lose pixels.
   - **Connection Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox) and Pixels**: Identical in input and output for every Green (e.g., train 1: [4,9,5,9] pixels=2 same; train 2: [2,5,4,5] pixels=3 same; train 3: [3,5,6,6] pixels=5 same; train 4: [1,2,1,4] pixels=3 same).
     - **Color**: Green does not propagate to adjacent Maroon; no color change or mixing.
     - **Holes**: Remains 0; no interaction altering this.
   - **Effect on Maroon**: Green's bbox positions consistently constrain Maroon splitting (Maroon fills around but never inside Green bboxes), reducing total Maroon pixels without Green gaining any.
   - **Consistency**: Every Green in every input is preserved exactly; no expansion, shrinkage, or new instances in any output. This is the only color with zero change across all trains.

#### 3. **Non-Green Colored Components (Holes=0) → Maroon (Pixel Absorption and bbox Expansion)**
   - **Interaction**: Non-Green small components (e.g., Yellow, Red, Pink, Blue, Light Blue, Dark Red; all holes=0) consistently interact with adjacent Maroon by absorbing some of its pixels, leading to expansion. This reduces Maroon's total pixels while increasing the non-Green color's total pixels (via existing components growing or new small ones forming from Maroon).
   - **Connection Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox)**: Input bboxes expand in output (e.g., train 2 Yellow [2,3,3,4] → [2,0,7,4]; train 3 Red [4,6,5,7] → [0,6,12,7]; train 4 Pink [2,3,3,4] → [2,0,3,4]). Expansion is always into areas overlapping input Maroon bbox.
     - **Pixel Count**: Non-Green total pixels increase (e.g., train 1 Yellow 4 → ~25 total; train 2 Yellow 4 → 13; train 3 Red 4 → 21, Yellow 4 → 27, Dark Red 4 → 10; train 4 Pink 4 → 11), directly correlating with Maroon pixel loss (1:1 absorption ratio, conserving total pixels).
     - **Color**: The non-Green color propagates into former Maroon areas; no color change to Green or Maroon.
     - **Holes**: Remains 0 for both; no new holes created.
   - **Effect on Maroon**: Adjacent Maroon pixels are consistently "consumed" by the non-Green component, causing Maroon bbox fragmentation. This interaction only occurs where non-Green bboxes touch or neighbor Maroon in input.
   - **Consistency**: Every non-Green component in every train expands or spawns new instances by absorbing Maroon (no static non-Greens). Total pixel conservation holds across all. The exact absorption rule (e.g., which adjacent pixels are taken, distance limits) is unknown, as it depends on input-specific positions/shapes.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Elements
- **Shape Properties (e.g., Silhouettes, Edges)**: No consistent interaction; some inputs have L-shaped or bar-like extensions (implied by bboxes like [2,3,4,5]), but they do not reliably affect color or position changes across all trains (e.g., present in train 4 but not affecting Green).
- **Hole Count → Color**: Only Maroon holes (>0) consistently resolve to 0 in output; non-Maroon holes=0 do not influence color propagation uniformly.
- **Specific Position Effects (e.g., Top/Bottom Edges)**: Outputs often have small 1-pixel components near edges (y=0 or high y), but colors and positions vary (e.g., Blue/Yellow in train 1, Red/Yellow in train 3), not consistent across all.
- **Overall Transformation Rule**: The precise mechanism (e.g., why only non-Green expands, how far propagation goes) cannot be explained from consistent patterns alone; it appears dependent on unobservable factors like pixel-level adjacency or simulation steps.

These are the only interactions observable as fully consistent in every train example. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided.

[2025-10-01 00:39:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if (c != bg and
                g[r][k + 1] == c and
                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically across **every** train example (no exceptions). I focused only on elements with clear, repeated interactions (e.g., via position adjacency, color influence, or property changes like pixel count or bbox expansion). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background black areas, which are never listed) are excluded. Inconsistent or sporadic patterns (e.g., specific directions of expansion, creation of single-pixel components in non-Maroon colors) are not included, as they do not occur in every example. If a transformation cannot be clearly linked to an interaction without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Maroon (Large Component with Holes >0) → Multiple Maroon (Small Components with Holes=0)**
   - **Interaction**: The single large Maroon component in every input (with holes >0, covering a broad bbox like [0,0,N,N] and high pixel count, e.g., 51–523 pixels) consistently splits into multiple smaller Maroon components in the output (all with holes=0, smaller bboxes, and lower individual pixel counts, e.g., 1–92 pixels each).
   - **Connection Properties**:
     - **Holes**: Input holes (>0) are eliminated; all output Maroons have holes=0 (consistent property transformation).
     - **Pixel Count**: Total Maroon pixels decrease (e.g., train 1: 523 → ~487; train 2: 51 → 42; train 3: 362 → ~317; train 4: 131 → 123), with conservation of overall image pixels when combined with other colors.
     - **Position (bbox)**: Input bbox is subdivided; output Maroons fill gaps around other components but avoid direct overlap with non-Maroon bboxes.
   - **Affected By**: Position of all non-Maroon components (see below); the splitting is always bounded by their bboxes.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every train; no exceptions. The exact splitting rule (e.g., how bboxes are divided) is unknown, as it varies by input layout.

#### 2. **Green Components (Holes=0) ↔ Maroon (No Change or Expansion)**
   - **Interaction**: All Green components (holes=0, small bboxes, low pixel counts like 1–11) remain completely unchanged in the output, acting as static barriers that prevent Maroon from overlapping their exact positions. No new Green components are created, and existing ones do not absorb or lose pixels.
   - **Connection Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox) and Pixels**: Identical in input and output for every Green (e.g., train 1: [4,9,5,9] pixels=2 same; train 2: [2,5,4,5] pixels=3 same; train 3: [3,5,6,6] pixels=5 same; train 4: [1,2,1,4] pixels=3 same).
     - **Color**: Green does not propagate to adjacent Maroon; no color change or mixing.
     - **Holes**: Remains 0; no interaction altering this.
   - **Effect on Maroon**: Green's bbox positions consistently constrain Maroon splitting (Maroon fills around but never inside Green bboxes), reducing total Maroon pixels without Green gaining any.
   - **Consistency**: Every Green in every input is preserved exactly; no expansion, shrinkage, or new instances in any output. This is the only color with zero change across all trains.

#### 3. **Non-Green Colored Components (Holes=0) → Maroon (Pixel Absorption and bbox Expansion)**
   - **Interaction**: Non-Green small components (e.g., Yellow, Red, Pink, Blue, Light Blue, Dark Red; all holes=0) consistently interact with adjacent Maroon by absorbing some of its pixels, leading to expansion. This reduces Maroon's total pixels while increasing the non-Green color's total pixels (via existing components growing or new small ones forming from Maroon).
   - **Connection Properties**:
     - **Position (bbox)**: Input bboxes expand in output (e.g., train 2 Yellow [2,3,3,4] → [2,0,7,4]; train 3 Red [4,6,5,7] → [0,6,12,7]; train 4 Pink [2,3,3,4] → [2,0,3,4]). Expansion is always into areas overlapping input Maroon bbox.
     - **Pixel Count**: Non-Green total pixels increase (e.g., train 1 Yellow 4 → ~25 total; train 2 Yellow 4 → 13; train 3 Red 4 → 21, Yellow 4 → 27, Dark Red 4 → 10; train 4 Pink 4 → 11), directly correlating with Maroon pixel loss (1:1 absorption ratio, conserving total pixels).
     - **Color**: The non-Green color propagates into former Maroon areas; no color change to Green or Maroon.
     - **Holes**: Remains 0 for both; no new holes created.
   - **Effect on Maroon**: Adjacent Maroon pixels are consistently "consumed" by the non-Green component, causing Maroon bbox fragmentation. This interaction only occurs where non-Green bboxes touch or neighbor Maroon in input.
   - **Consistency**: Every non-Green component in every train expands or spawns new instances by absorbing Maroon (no static non-Greens). Total pixel conservation holds across all. The exact absorption rule (e.g., which adjacent pixels are taken, distance limits) is unknown, as it depends on input-specific positions/shapes.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Elements
- **Shape Properties (e.g., Silhouettes, Edges)**: No consistent interaction; some inputs have L-shaped or bar-like extensions (implied by bboxes like [2,3,4,5]), but they do not reliably affect color or position changes across all trains (e.g., present in train 4 but not affecting Green).
- **Hole Count → Color**: Only Maroon holes (>0) consistently resolve to 0 in output; non-Maroon holes=0 do not influence color propagation uniformly.
- **Specific Position Effects (e.g., Top/Bottom Edges)**: Outputs often have small 1-pixel components near edges (y=0 or high y), but colors and positions vary (e.g., Blue/Yellow in train 1, Red/Yellow in train 3), not consistent across all.
- **Overall Transformation Rule**: The precise mechanism (e.g., why only non-Green expands, how far propagation goes) cannot be explained from consistent patterns alone; it appears dependent on unobservable factors like pixel-level adjacency or simulation steps.

These are the only interactions observable as fully consistent in every train example. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:55:31] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" connected regions starting from detected 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, filling adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until blocked by a different color, effectively completing patterns or shapes in a visual puzzle like a partial nonogram or blob expansion. The process iterates until no more changes occur, with background identified as the most common cell value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/4, likely 0 in test).
 * Expansion only triggers from 2x2 blocks of identical non-bg color; skips if block color is 3 (special case, perhaps a "fixed" or non-expandable color).
 * Fills must stop at boundaries: horizontal/vertical expand along rows/columns until hitting non-bg/non-matching color or edge; diagonals follow specific slopes (up-left: rr - (r - k), up-right: s - rr where s = r + (k+1), etc.) and stop similarly.
 * Iterations are bounded (h*w times) to prevent infinite loops, and blocks are sorted by (row, col) for consistent processing order.
 * Subtlety: Expansions can chain (one fill creates new 2x2 blocks for further fills), but the code processes all blocks in one pass before re-scanning, which may miss some chaining if not iterated fully.
 * Diagonal fills are asymmetric and direction-specific: up-left/down-right follow one diagonal slope, up-right/down-left follow the other; they only fill bg cells in the line, not branching.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal/vertical apply to both rows/columns of the 2x2 block simultaneously; diagonals start from the block's position but extend outward only (not inward, as the block is already filled).
 * Color 3 blocks are skipped entirely, preventing over-expansion of certain elements (seen in training 1 where 3's form fixed shapes).
 * Grids may have irregular patterns (e.g., scattered seeds like 2's in test), requiring multiple iterations to propagate fills correctly without overwriting existing non-bg cells.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills only if cell is bg or matches c, but breaks if non-matching non-bg, which is correct but can lead to incomplete fills if blocks overlap incorrectly.
 * No rotation or symmetry assumption; process top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode, essential for all fills; works in all examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects seed 2x2 blocks accurately; core to triggering expansions; reliable across examples.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # left
        cc = k - 1
        while cc >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
                break
            cc -= 1
        # right
        cc = k + 2
        while cc < w:
            if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
                break
            cc += 1
    return changed
```
(Handles row-wise expansion for the two rows of the block; works well for straight lines but note it skips the block itself (k to k+1).)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], k: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal but column-wise; effective for vertical propagation.)

(The diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are helpful for slope-based fills but have bugs in slope calculations, leading to off-diagonal paths in some cases; retain but fix indexing.)

(The main program loop with deepcopy, sorting blocks by (r,k), and iteration until no change is helpful for convergence, but max_iter = h*w may be too low for complex chaining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 2 and 4, expanding fills properly for 1's, 9's, 3's, 4's, 6's, and 7's in those cases without overfilling.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated misplaced 1's and 9's in the top half (e.g., row 0 has 1 at col 2 instead of expected empty 8's; bottom rows 20-23 have incorrect 6's positions, like row 20 col 2-6 as 6's but expected has 6's only in specific tapered shape starting row 21), and row 7 col 18 as 4 instead of expected 8; also duplicated 3's blocks without proper diagonal extension, leading to asymmetric fills (unknown why 6's appeared—possibly erroneous bg fill with wrong c).
 * Failed training example 3: Bottom half overfilled 7's into row 19 (full row of 7's but expected has partial 7's only in row 19 cols 5-7 and row 20 partial); top half failed to fill 2's correctly (e.g., row 2 col 18 as 8 instead of 2, row 6 col 13 as 2 but expected 8); 3's in row 13 col 14 as 4 instead of 3, suggesting diagonal functions misaligned or skipped valid blocks.
 * Successful cases (2 and 4) show horizontal/vertical fills work reliably for straight patterns, but diagonals may underperform in asymmetric grids.
 * Skipping c==3 blocks is helpful (prevents fixed shapes from expanding, correct in ex1/3), but may need generalization for other "seed" colors.
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; find_blocks is partial but useful—consider adding a full connected-component finder for post-fill validation.
 * Diagonal functions are broken in slope math (e.g., up-right uses s = r + (k+1), but for block at (r,k)-(r+1,k+1), it may not align with the anti-diagonal; leads to off-path fills in ex1/3); not fully helpful until fixed.
 * Overall, iteration loop converges correctly when directions align, but chaining fails in dense grids (ex1/3), and no handling for overlapping expansions causing color conflicts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (bg=0 correctly identified; 4's expanded along the main diagonal from rows 0-24 cols 0-24, filling bg to form a thick band; 2's filled horizontally/vertically in scattered positions like row 2 cols 18-19, row 6 col 21-25, and some diagonals; 8's filled a small block in rows 6-9 cols 22-25 and rows 24-27 cols 23-25; 3's in rows 11-12 cols 5-6 unchanged as expected since skipped).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Introduced erroneous 7's in bottom-right (rows 25-28 cols 24-29, forming a partial block, but input has no 7 seeds—possibly spillover from unhandled 2 or 8 expansion); overfilled 2's in row 22 col 29 as 7? (input has 7 there? Wait, input row 22 col 29=7, but generated has 7's spreading incorrectly); diagonal fills for 2's in row 2 col 28 as 2 (but input has 2 there, expected no spread); incomplete 8's in row 10 (only partial, missing vertical down to match input seeds); and row 13 col 4 as 8 but input has 8, yet no further diagonal to connect 3's. Differences suggest diagonal bugs cause misfills (e.g., 7's unknown origin—perhaps bg misdetect or c=7 from nowhere), and iterations didn't propagate 4's fully to connect bottom 7's; test needs more chaining and fixed diagonals to complete shapes without artifacts.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 00:55:42] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all train examples (inputs 1-4 and their outputs), the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably influence or affect each other in a repeatable way (e.g., via adjacency in bbox, shared regions, or direct property preservation/transformation). I ignored isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon without overlap), inconsistent behaviors (e.g., variable directions of extension not tied to a common trigger), and anything requiring assumption or solving (e.g., why new small edge components appear—marked as unknown where unexplained). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted.

#### 1. **Green Components (Static Anchors) ↔ Position/Bbox of Adjacent Non-Green Colored Components (e.g., Yellow, Red, Pink, Blue, Light Blue, Dark Red)**
   - **Description**: Green shapes (always holes=0, variable bbox/pixels, bean-like or irregular) remain completely unchanged (same bbox, pixels, holes) in outputs. Their positions directly constrain or anchor transformations of overlapping/adjacent non-Green colored components (bbox overlap or edge adjacency within 1-2 units). Affected components extend bbox edges toward or around the Green's position, preserving pixels but altering shape (e.g., from compact to elongated). This holds in every train:
     - Train 1: Greens at [1,19,4,22], [19,9,20,12] anchor Pink/Yellow extensions (e.g., Yellow [18,10,19,11] → [18,5,19,16]).
     - Train 2: Greens at [1,2,2,4], [2,5,4,5] anchor Yellow [2,3,3,4] → [2,0,7,4].
     - Train 3: Greens at [3,5,6,6]/[3,7,6,8] anchor Red [4,6,5,7] → [0,6,12,7]; Greens at [11,10,12,10]/[11,12,13,13] anchor Yellow [12,11,13,12] → [0,7,13,12].
     - Train 4: Greens at [1,2,1,4]/[2,3,4,5] anchor Pink [2,3,3,4] → multiple extended Pinks (e.g., [2,0,3,4]).
   - **Properties Involved**: Green's bbox position → Non-Green bbox expansion (edges shift by 1-12 units, often horizontally/vertically); pixels of non-Green increase via absorption (unknown exact mechanism, but consistently tied to Green proximity).
   - **Consistency Note**: No transformation occurs without a nearby Green; isolated non-Greens do not appear in trains.

#### 2. **Non-Green Colored Components (e.g., Yellow, Red, Pink, Blue, Light Blue, Dark Red) ↔ Maroon Background (Segmentation/Filling)**
   - **Description**: Non-Green colored components (holes=0 in input) interact with the large input Maroon (holes≥1, large bbox encompassing all, e.g., [0,0,N,N]) by "filling" or bordering its regions, causing Maroon to fragment into smaller holes=0 pieces in output (bboxes shrink to 1-3 units, pixels 1-20). This creates new small Maroon segments adjacent to the non-Green's original/expanded position. Consistent across all:
     - Train 1: Input Maroon [0,0,23,23] holes=4 fragments into ~20 small Maroons (e.g., [0,0,7,8], [10,0,19,8]) around Yellow/Blue/Light Blue positions.
     - Train 2: Input Maroon [0,0,7,7] holes=1 → 3 small Maroons (e.g., [0,0,2,5], [0,5,7,7]) bordering expanded Yellow.
     - Train 3: Input Maroon [0,0,19,19] holes=2 → multiple small Maroons (e.g., [0,0,17,6], [0,7,12,10]) near Red/Yellow expansions.
     - Train 4: Input Maroon [0,0,11,11] holes=1 → remains large but with subtracted pixels (131→110), plus small bordering pieces implied by Pink growth.
   - **Properties Involved**: Non-Green bbox/pixels → Maroon holes reduction (to 0) and bbox splitting (new segments form at prior hole edges); Maroon pixels decrease overall (e.g., absorbed into non-Green expansions). Position of non-Green determines which Maroon regions segment first (adjacent ones).
   - **Consistency Note**: Maroon always starts as a single large component with holes>0 and ends fragmented; no fragmentation without non-Green proximity. Total Maroon pixels decrease by amount roughly matching non-Green pixel gains.

#### 3. **Input Holes in Maroon ↔ Number/Position of Output Small Non-Green Components (Edge Propagation)**
   - **Description**: The number of holes in input Maroon (1-4) correlates with the creation of new small (pixels=1-2, bbox 1x1) non-Green components at image edges (e.g., x=0, y=0, or max bounds) in output. These new components match the color of an adjacent input non-Green and appear along paths from Maroon holes to edges, but exact path mechanism is unknown. Consistent count-based trigger in every train:
     - Train 1: 4 holes → ~10 new small Blue/Yellow/Light Blue at top/left edges (e.g., [20,0], [0,6]).
     - Train 2: 1 hole → 2 new small Yellow at bottom/left (e.g., [1,5,1,5], [0,6,0,6]).
     - Train 3: 2 holes → ~8 new small Red/Yellow at top (e.g., [18,0], [0,18]).
     - Train 4: 1 hole → 2 new small Pink at bottom/left (e.g., [1,5,1,5], [0,6,0,6]).
   - **Properties Involved**: Maroon holes count → New non-Green components creation (color matches nearest input non-Green; bbox fixed at edges); position of holes → Edge placement (propagates outward from hole centers).
   - **Consistency Note**: New components always holes=0, pixels=1; no new components without input Maroon holes. (Unknown: Why specific colors are chosen for propagation—always matches a nearby non-Green, but not all non-Greens propagate equally.)

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Elements
- **Blue/Light Blue specific interactions**: Appear only in Train 1; nested within/near Greens (e.g., Light Blue [4,10,5,11] bbox inside Green clusters), but transformation (duplication to edges) not replicable in other trains lacking them—no forced connection.
- **Dark Red**: Only in Train 3; extends leftward [6,18,7,19] → [0,18,7,19] near Green, but direction not consistent with other colors' extensions (e.g., Yellow often up/right).
- **Pixel Count Changes**: Non-Green pixels increase (e.g., Yellow Train 2: 4→11+1+1), but exact formula tied to bbox expansion/Maroon absorption is unknown (consistent trend, but not explainable without solving).
- **Silhouette/Shape Properties (e.g., Edges, Holes in Non-Maroon)**: All non-Maroon have holes=0 consistently, but no edge/hole interaction affects others (no transformation based on shape irregularity).
- **Color-to-Color Direct (No Green Involved)**: No isolated interactions (e.g., Yellow ↔ Red without Green/Maroon); all require Green or Maroon mediation.
- **Overall Image Size/Position Scaling**: Bboxes stay within input bounds; no global transformation consistent across all.

These are the only connections that appear in **every** train example without variation or irrelevance. Test inputs were not analyzed for patterns (per instructions: focus on trains for consistency), but they contain similar components (e.g., Greens, Maroon fragments, Red/Yellow/Pink) that could interact via the above if transformed.

[2025-10-01 00:57:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if (c != bg and
                g[r][k + 1] == c and
                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" connected regions starting from detected 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, filling adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until blocked by a different color, effectively completing patterns or shapes in a visual puzzle like a partial nonogram or blob expansion. The process iterates until no more changes occur, with background identified as the most common cell value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/4, likely 0 in test).
 * Expansion only triggers from 2x2 blocks of identical non-bg color; skips if block color is 3 (special case, perhaps a "fixed" or non-expandable color).
 * Fills must stop at boundaries: horizontal/vertical expand along rows/columns until hitting non-bg/non-matching color or edge; diagonals follow specific slopes (up-left: rr - (r - k), up-right: s - rr where s = r + (k+1), etc.) and stop similarly.
 * Iterations are bounded (h*w times) to prevent infinite loops, and blocks are sorted by (row, col) for consistent processing order.
 * Subtlety: Expansions can chain (one fill creates new 2x2 blocks for further fills), but the code processes all blocks in one pass before re-scanning, which may miss some chaining if not iterated fully.
 * Diagonal fills are asymmetric and direction-specific: up-left/down-right follow one diagonal slope, up-right/down-left follow the other; they only fill bg cells in the line, not branching.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal/vertical apply to both rows/columns of the 2x2 block simultaneously; diagonals start from the block's position but extend outward only (not inward, as the block is already filled).
 * Color 3 blocks are skipped entirely, preventing over-expansion of certain elements (seen in training 1 where 3's form fixed shapes).
 * Grids may have irregular patterns (e.g., scattered seeds like 2's in test), requiring multiple iterations to propagate fills correctly without overwriting existing non-bg cells.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills only if cell is bg or matches c, but breaks if non-matching non-bg, which is correct but can lead to incomplete fills if blocks overlap incorrectly.
 * No rotation or symmetry assumption; process top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode, essential for all fills; works in all examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects seed 2x2 blocks accurately; core to triggering expansions; reliable across examples.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # left
        cc = k - 1
        while cc >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
                break
            cc -= 1
        # right
        cc = k + 2
        while cc < w:
            if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
                break
            cc += 1
    return changed
```
(Handles row-wise expansion for the two rows of the block; works well for straight lines but note it skips the block itself (k to k+1).)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], k: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal but column-wise; effective for vertical propagation.)

(The diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are helpful for slope-based fills but have bugs in slope calculations, leading to off-diagonal paths in some cases; retain but fix indexing.)

(The main program loop with deepcopy, sorting blocks by (r,k), and iteration until no change is helpful for convergence, but max_iter = h*w may be too low for complex chaining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 2 and 4, expanding fills properly for 1's, 9's, 3's, 4's, 6's, and 7's in those cases without overfilling.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated misplaced 1's and 9's in the top half (e.g., row 0 has 1 at col 2 instead of expected empty 8's; bottom rows 20-23 have incorrect 6's positions, like row 20 col 2-6 as 6's but expected has 6's only in specific tapered shape starting row 21), and row 7 col 18 as 4 instead of expected 8; also duplicated 3's blocks without proper diagonal extension, leading to asymmetric fills (unknown why 6's appeared—possibly erroneous bg fill with wrong c).
 * Failed training example 3: Bottom half overfilled 7's into row 19 (full row of 7's but expected has partial 7's only in row 19 cols 5-7 and row 20 partial); top half failed to fill 2's correctly (e.g., row 2 col 18 as 8 instead of 2, row 6 col 13 as 2 but expected 8); 3's in row 13 col 14 as 4 instead of 3, suggesting diagonal functions misaligned or skipped valid blocks.
 * Successful cases (2 and 4) show horizontal/vertical fills work reliably for straight patterns, but diagonals may underperform in asymmetric grids.
 * Skipping c==3 blocks is helpful (prevents fixed shapes from expanding, correct in ex1/3), but may need generalization for other "seed" colors.
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; find_blocks is partial but useful—consider adding a full connected-component finder for post-fill validation.
 * Diagonal functions are broken in slope math (e.g., up-right uses s = r + (k+1), but for block at (r,k)-(r+1,k+1), it may not align with the anti-diagonal; leads to off-path fills in ex1/3); not fully helpful until fixed.
 * Overall, iteration loop converges correctly when directions align, but chaining fails in dense grids (ex1/3), and no handling for overlapping expansions causing color conflicts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (bg=0 correctly identified; 4's expanded along the main diagonal from rows 0-24 cols 0-24, filling bg to form a thick band; 2's filled horizontally/vertically in scattered positions like row 2 cols 18-19, row 6 col 21-25, and some diagonals; 8's filled a small block in rows 6-9 cols 22-25 and rows 24-27 cols 23-25; 3's in rows 11-12 cols 5-6 unchanged as expected since skipped).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Introduced erroneous 7's in bottom-right (rows 25-28 cols 24-29, forming a partial block, but input has no 7 seeds—possibly spillover from unhandled 2 or 8 expansion); overfilled 2's in row 22 col 29 as 7? (input has 7 there? Wait, input row 22 col 29=7, but generated has 7's spreading incorrectly); diagonal fills for 2's in row 2 col 28 as 2 (but input has 2 there, expected no spread); incomplete 8's in row 10 (only partial, missing vertical down to match input seeds); and row 13 col 4 as 8 but input has 8, yet no further diagonal to connect 3's. Differences suggest diagonal bugs cause misfills (e.g., 7's unknown origin—perhaps bg misdetect or c=7 from nowhere), and iterations didn't propagate 4's fully to connect bottom 7's; test needs more chaining and fixed diagonals to complete shapes without artifacts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all train examples (inputs 1-4 and their outputs), the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably influence or affect each other in a repeatable way (e.g., via adjacency in bbox, shared regions, or direct property preservation/transformation). I ignored isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon without overlap), inconsistent behaviors (e.g., variable directions of extension not tied to a common trigger), and anything requiring assumption or solving (e.g., why new small edge components appear—marked as unknown where unexplained). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted.

#### 1. **Green Components (Static Anchors) ↔ Position/Bbox of Adjacent Non-Green Colored Components (e.g., Yellow, Red, Pink, Blue, Light Blue, Dark Red)**
   - **Description**: Green shapes (always holes=0, variable bbox/pixels, bean-like or irregular) remain completely unchanged (same bbox, pixels, holes) in outputs. Their positions directly constrain or anchor transformations of overlapping/adjacent non-Green colored components (bbox overlap or edge adjacency within 1-2 units). Affected components extend bbox edges toward or around the Green's position, preserving pixels but altering shape (e.g., from compact to elongated). This holds in every train:
     - Train 1: Greens at [1,19,4,22], [19,9,20,12] anchor Pink/Yellow extensions (e.g., Yellow [18,10,19,11] → [18,5,19,16]).
     - Train 2: Greens at [1,2,2,4], [2,5,4,5] anchor Yellow [2,3,3,4] → [2,0,7,4].
     - Train 3: Greens at [3,5,6,6]/[3,7,6,8] anchor Red [4,6,5,7] → [0,6,12,7]; Greens at [11,10,12,10]/[11,12,13,13] anchor Yellow [12,11,13,12] → [0,7,13,12].
     - Train 4: Greens at [1,2,1,4]/[2,3,4,5] anchor Pink [2,3,3,4] → multiple extended Pinks (e.g., [2,0,3,4]).
   - **Properties Involved**: Green's bbox position → Non-Green bbox expansion (edges shift by 1-12 units, often horizontally/vertically); pixels of non-Green increase via absorption (unknown exact mechanism, but consistently tied to Green proximity).
   - **Consistency Note**: No transformation occurs without a nearby Green; isolated non-Greens do not appear in trains.

#### 2. **Non-Green Colored Components (e.g., Yellow, Red, Pink, Blue, Light Blue, Dark Red) ↔ Maroon Background (Segmentation/Filling)**
   - **Description**: Non-Green colored components (holes=0 in input) interact with the large input Maroon (holes≥1, large bbox encompassing all, e.g., [0,0,N,N]) by "filling" or bordering its regions, causing Maroon to fragment into smaller holes=0 pieces in output (bboxes shrink to 1-3 units, pixels 1-20). This creates new small Maroon segments adjacent to the non-Green's original/expanded position. Consistent across all:
     - Train 1: Input Maroon [0,0,23,23] holes=4 fragments into ~20 small Maroons (e.g., [0,0,7,8], [10,0,19,8]) around Yellow/Blue/Light Blue positions.
     - Train 2: Input Maroon [0,0,7,7] holes=1 → 3 small Maroons (e.g., [0,0,2,5], [0,5,7,7]) bordering expanded Yellow.
     - Train 3: Input Maroon [0,0,19,19] holes=2 → multiple small Maroons (e.g., [0,0,17,6], [0,7,12,10]) near Red/Yellow expansions.
     - Train 4: Input Maroon [0,0,11,11] holes=1 → remains large but with subtracted pixels (131→110), plus small bordering pieces implied by Pink growth.
   - **Properties Involved**: Non-Green bbox/pixels → Maroon holes reduction (to 0) and bbox splitting (new segments form at prior hole edges); Maroon pixels decrease overall (e.g., absorbed into non-Green expansions). Position of non-Green determines which Maroon regions segment first (adjacent ones).
   - **Consistency Note**: Maroon always starts as a single large component with holes>0 and ends fragmented; no fragmentation without non-Green proximity. Total Maroon pixels decrease by amount roughly matching non-Green pixel gains.

#### 3. **Input Holes in Maroon ↔ Number/Position of Output Small Non-Green Components (Edge Propagation)**
   - **Description**: The number of holes in input Maroon (1-4) correlates with the creation of new small (pixels=1-2, bbox 1x1) non-Green components at image edges (e.g., x=0, y=0, or max bounds) in output. These new components match the color of an adjacent input non-Green and appear along paths from Maroon holes to edges, but exact path mechanism is unknown. Consistent count-based trigger in every train:
     - Train 1: 4 holes → ~10 new small Blue/Yellow/Light Blue at top/left edges (e.g., [20,0], [0,6]).
     - Train 2: 1 hole → 2 new small Yellow at bottom/left (e.g., [1,5,1,5], [0,6,0,6]).
     - Train 3: 2 holes → ~8 new small Red/Yellow at top (e.g., [18,0], [0,18]).
     - Train 4: 1 hole → 2 new small Pink at bottom/left (e.g., [1,5,1,5], [0,6,0,6]).
   - **Properties Involved**: Maroon holes count → New non-Green components creation (color matches nearest input non-Green; bbox fixed at edges); position of holes → Edge placement (propagates outward from hole centers).
   - **Consistency Note**: New components always holes=0, pixels=1; no new components without input Maroon holes. (Unknown: Why specific colors are chosen for propagation—always matches a nearby non-Green, but not all non-Greens propagate equally.)

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Elements
- **Blue/Light Blue specific interactions**: Appear only in Train 1; nested within/near Greens (e.g., Light Blue [4,10,5,11] bbox inside Green clusters), but transformation (duplication to edges) not replicable in other trains lacking them—no forced connection.
- **Dark Red**: Only in Train 3; extends leftward [6,18,7,19] → [0,18,7,19] near Green, but direction not consistent with other colors' extensions (e.g., Yellow often up/right).
- **Pixel Count Changes**: Non-Green pixels increase (e.g., Yellow Train 2: 4→11+1+1), but exact formula tied to bbox expansion/Maroon absorption is unknown (consistent trend, but not explainable without solving).
- **Silhouette/Shape Properties (e.g., Edges, Holes in Non-Maroon)**: All non-Maroon have holes=0 consistently, but no edge/hole interaction affects others (no transformation based on shape irregularity).
- **Color-to-Color Direct (No Green Involved)**: No isolated interactions (e.g., Yellow ↔ Red without Green/Maroon); all require Green or Maroon mediation.
- **Overall Image Size/Position Scaling**: Bboxes stay within input bounds; no global transformation consistent across all.

These are the only connections that appear in **every** train example without variation or irrelevance. Test inputs were not analyzed for patterns (per instructions: focus on trains for consistency), but they contain similar components (e.g., Greens, Maroon fragments, Red/Yellow/Pink) that could interact via the above if transformed.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 01:04:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or flood-filling, where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 cells trigger propagation of that color along straight lines (horizontal, vertical) and possibly diagonals, filling adjacent background cells until blocked by other colors or 3s, with the goal of transforming the input grid to match an expected filled pattern. The background color is dynamically determined (e.g., most common cell value), and 3 appears to act as a special blocker or non-fillable element.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent cell value in the grid, but this may not always align with the expected output's dominant color (e.g., in Training 1, generated uses 9 as bg but expected uses 8, leading to over-filling with 9s instead of 8s).
 * 2x2 blocks are detected only if all four cells match a color c != bg and c != 3; blocks are sorted by row then column for processing order, which may affect iteration stability.
 * Propagation occurs from detected 2x2 blocks in multiple directions: horizontal (left/right from the block's rows, skipping over c or 3 but stopping at other colors), vertical (up/down from the block's columns), and four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) starting from each corner of the block, again filling only bg cells and stopping at non-c/non-3/non-bg.
 * The process iterates up to h*w times or until no blocks or changes occur, using a deepcopy to avoid mutating the original; however, applying propagations to all blocks in a single pass per iteration can cause over-filling or interference between blocks.
 * 3 cells are never filled or used as seeds but block propagation; other colors (e.g., 1,4,6,7,8,9) can be seeds or blockers depending on context.
 * Subtle element: Propagation does not fill within the 2x2 block itself (already filled) and starts strictly outside (e.g., horizontal from k-1 left and k+2 right); diagonals are one-directional from each corner and may not connect properly across the grid.
 * Grids can be irregular in shape/content (e.g., sparse with many 0s in test), and propagation must respect bounds without wrapping.
 * Order of processing blocks and directions matters; current top-to-bottom, left-to-right may miss dependencies where later blocks rely on earlier fills.
 * Easy to miss: Not all lines need full-grid spanning; partial fills stop at blockers, and multiple overlapping propagations from different blocks/colors must resolve without overwriting (current code allows it, leading to inconsistencies).
 * 0 may represent a special bg variant or empty, but treated as fillable like other bg; in test, excessive 0s remain unfilled or wrongly filled.
 * Iterations may loop inefficiently if new blocks form mid-process; current code re-finds blocks each iteration but applies to all at once.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as bg, useful for initialization, though it may need adjustment if bg isn't strictly most common.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by row then col
```
(This is helpful for detecting seed 2x2 blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent order.)

The apply_* functions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for directional filling logic, as they correctly skip over c/3 and stop at other colors while filling bg, but they are broken for multi-block interactions (e.g., they apply unconditionally per block without checking post-fill state, leading to overwrites).

No types like PuzzleElement are present, but tp.List[tp.List[int]] is a good type hint for grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects 2x2 blocks and attempts line-based propagation but fails overall due to incorrect bg choice or over-aggressive filling.
 * Training 1: Generated over-fills top rows with 9s (assuming 9 as bg) and scatters 1s/4s/6s/3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 has all 9s except ends with 1/8, but expected has mostly 8s with patterned 9/1/4/3/6); bottom sections have mismatched 6/3/8 placements (e.g., generated row 20 has 6,3,6,6,9,... but expected has 8,3,6,6,6,...); unknown why 8s appear sporadically instead of dominating as in expected.
 * Training 2: Generated fills almost entirely with 4s and leaves 3s isolated (e.g., row 2: [4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4] vs expected [8,3,3,4,3,8,8,8]), failing to propagate 8s as bg and expand shapes like the 3-triangle; bottom rows all 4s but expected has 4s only in specific positions with 8s elsewhere.
 * Training 3: Generated leaves large top areas as 2s (bg?) and poorly expands 3/4/7 patterns (e.g., row 5: [2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,...] with 8s filling bg areas); lower sections have fragmented 4/7/3 (e.g., row 11: [2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,2,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]), missing full 8-fills and shape completions.
 * Training 4: Generated mostly 6s with isolated 3s (e.g., row 2: [6,3,6,3,6,6,...] vs expected [8,3,6,3,6,8,...]), failing to introduce 8s as bg and expand the 3-pattern downward/rightward properly; bottom rows all 6s but expected has all 8s.
 * All trainings show under-filling of bg (e.g., 8s in expected) and incorrect color dominance; propagation seems to activate but doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., doesn't create the connected 8-regions or precise 3/4/6 blobs).
 * Function `program` is helpful as a main loop but broken in iteration logic (applies all propagations before re-checking blocks, causing chain reactions that overwrite expected patterns).
 * Diagonal functions are unhelpful or broken: they start from corners but don't connect lines properly (e.g., in Training 1, diagonals may cause stray 4s/1s not seen in expected straight-line fills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) is present, but it would be essential for identifying complete patterns beyond just 2x2 seeds; current code lacks blob detection or connectivity checks.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and directional fills but misses bg correctness, propagation stopping rules, and handling of multi-color interactions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves excessive 0s unfilled (e.g., most of the grid is still 0s, with sparse 4s along a diagonal-ish pattern in top-left, 2s scattered, and small 8/3/7 clusters in bottom-right), suggesting minimal propagation occurred—likely because bg=0 (most common) and few/no valid 2x2 blocks were detected or propagation stopped immediately due to blockers/3s.
 * It fails to create cohesive filled regions (e.g., the 8s in rows 6-7 and 25-28 are tiny and isolated, not expanding to cover bg areas as expected in trainings; 7s in bottom appear fragmented vs. potential full lines).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from trainings): Expected likely has a dominant bg (e.g., 0 or 8) filling large areas, with 2/4/3/7/8 propagating into shapes like lines or blobs from seeds, but generated has no such expansion—e.g., top rows have isolated 4s/2s but no horizontal/vertical fills connecting them, and bottom 7s don't form the connected patterns seen in training expectations.
 * Unknown why so many 0s persist (perhaps no 2x2 seeds at all, or propagation skips over 0s incorrectly); it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as it looks like a barely modified input rather than a completed pattern.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 01:04:53] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** train example (1 through 4). These are limited to properties or components that appear in all examples and exhibit identical behavior in input-to-output transformations. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific colors like Blue or Light Blue, which appear only in train 1; varying expansion directions for non-Green colors; or isolated small Maroon pieces without clear ties) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., precise rules for non-Green transformations) are noted as such.

1. **Green shapes and Maroon background (position and occupancy interaction)**:  
   Green shapes (always holes=0, variable pixels and bbox) consistently occupy specific positions in the input that "interact" with the Maroon background by creating unoccupied regions (evident from Maroon's large bbox encompassing the image and its holes property, which accounts for foreground placements). In every output, these exact Green positions (bbox coordinates), sizes (pixels), and properties (holes=0) are preserved unchanged, meaning the interaction maintains fixed "holes" or exclusions in the Maroon structure. This is the only foreground-background connection consistent across all examples; no other colors show this preservation.

2. **Green shapes and overall image structure (positional consistency)**:  
   The bbox y-coordinates (vertical positions) of Green shapes in inputs are consistently retained in outputs without shift or scaling, interacting with the broader composition to anchor the layout. For example, clustered y-ranges (e.g., around mid-image rows) in inputs map directly to similar relative positions in outputs, ensuring vertical alignment of preserved elements. This positional interaction does not alter x-coordinates or extend shapes, and it is independent of image size variations.

3. **Non-Green foreground shapes and Maroon background (expansion influence, mechanism unknown)**:  
   Non-Green shapes (e.g., Yellow in trains 1-3, Pink in trains 1 and 4, Red/Dark Red in train 3; always holes=0) consistently interact with the Maroon background by triggering expansions or merges in the output, where their input positions (bbox) determine the starting point for larger regions of the same color that fill or border Maroon areas. Unlike Greens, these shapes do not preserve exact bbox or pixels; instead, they influence Maroon fragmentation (outputs always show increased numbers of smaller Maroon components adjacent to these expanded regions). The exact transformation (e.g., direction of expansion or fill extent) is unknown and varies slightly by example, but the core interaction—position-driven influence on background subdivision—is consistent in every case.

No other connections (e.g., color-to-color effects like Green affecting Yellow, or hole counts beyond 0 influencing anything) are obvious or consistent across all examples. Elements like isolated small pixels or backgrounds without foreground ties show no interactions.

[2025-10-01 01:06:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or flood-filling, where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 cells trigger propagation of that color along straight lines (horizontal, vertical) and possibly diagonals, filling adjacent background cells until blocked by other colors or 3s, with the goal of transforming the input grid to match an expected filled pattern. The background color is dynamically determined (e.g., most common cell value), and 3 appears to act as a special blocker or non-fillable element.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent cell value in the grid, but this may not always align with the expected output's dominant color (e.g., in Training 1, generated uses 9 as bg but expected uses 8, leading to over-filling with 9s instead of 8s).
 * 2x2 blocks are detected only if all four cells match a color c != bg and c != 3; blocks are sorted by row then column for processing order, which may affect iteration stability.
 * Propagation occurs from detected 2x2 blocks in multiple directions: horizontal (left/right from the block's rows, skipping over c or 3 but stopping at other colors), vertical (up/down from the block's columns), and four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) starting from each corner of the block, again filling only bg cells and stopping at non-c/non-3/non-bg.
 * The process iterates up to h*w times or until no blocks or changes occur, using a deepcopy to avoid mutating the original; however, applying propagations to all blocks in a single pass per iteration can cause over-filling or interference between blocks.
 * 3 cells are never filled or used as seeds but block propagation; other colors (e.g., 1,4,6,7,8,9) can be seeds or blockers depending on context.
 * Subtle element: Propagation does not fill within the 2x2 block itself (already filled) and starts strictly outside (e.g., horizontal from k-1 left and k+2 right); diagonals are one-directional from each corner and may not connect properly across the grid.
 * Grids can be irregular in shape/content (e.g., sparse with many 0s in test), and propagation must respect bounds without wrapping.
 * Order of processing blocks and directions matters; current top-to-bottom, left-to-right may miss dependencies where later blocks rely on earlier fills.
 * Easy to miss: Not all lines need full-grid spanning; partial fills stop at blockers, and multiple overlapping propagations from different blocks/colors must resolve without overwriting (current code allows it, leading to inconsistencies).
 * 0 may represent a special bg variant or empty, but treated as fillable like other bg; in test, excessive 0s remain unfilled or wrongly filled.
 * Iterations may loop inefficiently if new blocks form mid-process; current code re-finds blocks each iteration but applies to all at once.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as bg, useful for initialization, though it may need adjustment if bg isn't strictly most common.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by row then col
```
(This is helpful for detecting seed 2x2 blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent order.)

The apply_* functions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for directional filling logic, as they correctly skip over c/3 and stop at other colors while filling bg, but they are broken for multi-block interactions (e.g., they apply unconditionally per block without checking post-fill state, leading to overwrites).

No types like PuzzleElement are present, but tp.List[tp.List[int]] is a good type hint for grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects 2x2 blocks and attempts line-based propagation but fails overall due to incorrect bg choice or over-aggressive filling.
 * Training 1: Generated over-fills top rows with 9s (assuming 9 as bg) and scatters 1s/4s/6s/3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 has all 9s except ends with 1/8, but expected has mostly 8s with patterned 9/1/4/3/6); bottom sections have mismatched 6/3/8 placements (e.g., generated row 20 has 6,3,6,6,9,... but expected has 8,3,6,6,6,...); unknown why 8s appear sporadically instead of dominating as in expected.
 * Training 2: Generated fills almost entirely with 4s and leaves 3s isolated (e.g., row 2: [4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4] vs expected [8,3,3,4,3,8,8,8]), failing to propagate 8s as bg and expand shapes like the 3-triangle; bottom rows all 4s but expected has 4s only in specific positions with 8s elsewhere.
 * Training 3: Generated leaves large top areas as 2s (bg?) and poorly expands 3/4/7 patterns (e.g., row 5: [2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,...] with 8s filling bg areas); lower sections have fragmented 4/7/3 (e.g., row 11: [2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,2,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]), missing full 8-fills and shape completions.
 * Training 4: Generated mostly 6s with isolated 3s (e.g., row 2: [6,3,6,3,6,6,...] vs expected [8,3,6,3,6,8,...]), failing to introduce 8s as bg and expand the 3-pattern downward/rightward properly; bottom rows all 6s but expected has all 8s.
 * All trainings show under-filling of bg (e.g., 8s in expected) and incorrect color dominance; propagation seems to activate but doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., doesn't create the connected 8-regions or precise 3/4/6 blobs).
 * Function `program` is helpful as a main loop but broken in iteration logic (applies all propagations before re-checking blocks, causing chain reactions that overwrite expected patterns).
 * Diagonal functions are unhelpful or broken: they start from corners but don't connect lines properly (e.g., in Training 1, diagonals may cause stray 4s/1s not seen in expected straight-line fills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) is present, but it would be essential for identifying complete patterns beyond just 2x2 seeds; current code lacks blob detection or connectivity checks.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and directional fills but misses bg correctness, propagation stopping rules, and handling of multi-color interactions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves excessive 0s unfilled (e.g., most of the grid is still 0s, with sparse 4s along a diagonal-ish pattern in top-left, 2s scattered, and small 8/3/7 clusters in bottom-right), suggesting minimal propagation occurred—likely because bg=0 (most common) and few/no valid 2x2 blocks were detected or propagation stopped immediately due to blockers/3s.
 * It fails to create cohesive filled regions (e.g., the 8s in rows 6-7 and 25-28 are tiny and isolated, not expanding to cover bg areas as expected in trainings; 7s in bottom appear fragmented vs. potential full lines).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from trainings): Expected likely has a dominant bg (e.g., 0 or 8) filling large areas, with 2/4/3/7/8 propagating into shapes like lines or blobs from seeds, but generated has no such expansion—e.g., top rows have isolated 4s/2s but no horizontal/vertical fills connecting them, and bottom 7s don't form the connected patterns seen in training expectations.
 * Unknown why so many 0s persist (perhaps no 2x2 seeds at all, or propagation skips over 0s incorrectly); it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as it looks like a barely modified input rather than a completed pattern.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if (c != bg and
                g[r][k + 1] == c and
                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:

        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" connected regions starting from detected 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, filling adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until blocked by a different color, effectively completing patterns or shapes in a visual puzzle like a partial nonogram or blob expansion. The process iterates until no more changes occur, with background identified as the most common cell value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/4, likely 0 in test).
 * Expansion only triggers from 2x2 blocks of identical non-bg color; skips if block color is 3 (special case, perhaps a "fixed" or non-expandable color).
 * Fills must stop at boundaries: horizontal/vertical expand along rows/columns until hitting non-bg/non-matching color or edge; diagonals follow specific slopes (up-left: rr - (r - k), up-right: s - rr where s = r + (k+1), etc.) and stop similarly.
 * Iterations are bounded (h*w times) to prevent infinite loops, and blocks are sorted by (row, col) for consistent processing order.
 * Subtlety: Expansions can chain (one fill creates new 2x2 blocks for further fills), but the code processes all blocks in one pass before re-scanning, which may miss some chaining if not iterated fully.
 * Diagonal fills are asymmetric and direction-specific: up-left/down-right follow one diagonal slope, up-right/down-left follow the other; they only fill bg cells in the line, not branching.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal/vertical apply to both rows/columns of the 2x2 block simultaneously; diagonals start from the block's position but extend outward only (not inward, as the block is already filled).
 * Color 3 blocks are skipped entirely, preventing over-expansion of certain elements (seen in training 1 where 3's form fixed shapes).
 * Grids may have irregular patterns (e.g., scattered seeds like 2's in test), requiring multiple iterations to propagate fills correctly without overwriting existing non-bg cells.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills only if cell is bg or matches c, but breaks if non-matching non-bg, which is correct but can lead to incomplete fills if blocks overlap incorrectly.
 * No rotation or symmetry assumption; process top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This detects seed 2x2 blocks accurately; core to triggering expansions; reliable across examples.)

def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:

                break
            cc += 1

```
(Handles row-wise expansion for the two rows of the block; works well for straight lines but note it skips the block itself (k to k+1).)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], k: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:

                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1

            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal but column-wise; effective for vertical propagation.)

(The diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are helpful for slope-based fills but have bugs in slope calculations, leading to off-diagonal paths in some cases; retain but fix indexing.)

(The main program loop with deepcopy, sorting blocks by (r,k), and iteration until no change is helpful for convergence, but max_iter = h*w may be too low for complex chaining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 2 and 4, expanding fills properly for 1's, 9's, 3's, 4's, 6's, and 7's in those cases without overfilling.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated misplaced 1's and 9's in the top half (e.g., row 0 has 1 at col 2 instead of expected empty 8's; bottom rows 20-23 have incorrect 6's positions, like row 20 col 2-6 as 6's but expected has 6's only in specific tapered shape starting row 21), and row 7 col 18 as 4 instead of expected 8; also duplicated 3's blocks without proper diagonal extension, leading to asymmetric fills (unknown why 6's appeared—possibly erroneous bg fill with wrong c).
 * Failed training example 3: Bottom half overfilled 7's into row 19 (full row of 7's but expected has partial 7's only in row 19 cols 5-7 and row 20 partial); top half failed to fill 2's correctly (e.g., row 2 col 18 as 8 instead of 2, row 6 col 13 as 2 but expected 8); 3's in row 13 col 14 as 4 instead of 3, suggesting diagonal functions misaligned or skipped valid blocks.
 * Successful cases (2 and 4) show horizontal/vertical fills work reliably for straight patterns, but diagonals may underperform in asymmetric grids.
 * Skipping c==3 blocks is helpful (prevents fixed shapes from expanding, correct in ex1/3), but may need generalization for other "seed" colors.
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; find_blocks is partial but useful—consider adding a full connected-component finder for post-fill validation.
 * Diagonal functions are broken in slope math (e.g., up-right uses s = r + (k+1), but for block at (r,k)-(r+1,k+1), it may not align with the anti-diagonal; leads to off-path fills in ex1/3); not fully helpful until fixed.
 * Overall, iteration loop converges correctly when directions align, but chaining fails in dense grids (ex1/3), and no handling for overlapping expansions causing color conflicts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (bg=0 correctly identified; 4's expanded along the main diagonal from rows 0-24 cols 0-24, filling bg to form a thick band; 2's filled horizontally/vertically in scattered positions like row 2 cols 18-19, row 6 col 21-25, and some diagonals; 8's filled a small block in rows 6-9 cols 22-25 and rows 24-27 cols 23-25; 3's in rows 11-12 cols 5-6 unchanged as expected since skipped).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Introduced erroneous 7's in bottom-right (rows 25-28 cols 24-29, forming a partial block, but input has no 7 seeds—possibly spillover from unhandled 2 or 8 expansion); overfilled 2's in row 22 col 29 as 7? (input has 7 there? Wait, input row 22 col 29=7, but generated has 7's spreading incorrectly); diagonal fills for 2's in row 2 col 28 as 2 (but input has 2 there, expected no spread); incomplete 8's in row 10 (only partial, missing vertical down to match input seeds); and row 13 col 4 as 8 but input has 8, yet no further diagonal to connect 3's. Differences suggest diagonal bugs cause misfills (e.g., 7's unknown origin—perhaps bg misdetect or c=7 from nowhere), and iterations didn't propagate 4's fully to connect bottom 7's; test needs more chaining and fixed diagonals to complete shapes without artifacts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** train example (1 through 4). These are limited to properties or components that appear in all examples and exhibit identical behavior in input-to-output transformations. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific colors like Blue or Light Blue, which appear only in train 1; varying expansion directions for non-Green colors; or isolated small Maroon pieces without clear ties) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., precise rules for non-Green transformations) are noted as such.

1. **Green shapes and Maroon background (position and occupancy interaction)**:  
   Green shapes (always holes=0, variable pixels and bbox) consistently occupy specific positions in the input that "interact" with the Maroon background by creating unoccupied regions (evident from Maroon's large bbox encompassing the image and its holes property, which accounts for foreground placements). In every output, these exact Green positions (bbox coordinates), sizes (pixels), and properties (holes=0) are preserved unchanged, meaning the interaction maintains fixed "holes" or exclusions in the Maroon structure. This is the only foreground-background connection consistent across all examples; no other colors show this preservation.

2. **Green shapes and overall image structure (positional consistency)**:  
   The bbox y-coordinates (vertical positions) of Green shapes in inputs are consistently retained in outputs without shift or scaling, interacting with the broader composition to anchor the layout. For example, clustered y-ranges (e.g., around mid-image rows) in inputs map directly to similar relative positions in outputs, ensuring vertical alignment of preserved elements. This positional interaction does not alter x-coordinates or extend shapes, and it is independent of image size variations.

3. **Non-Green foreground shapes and Maroon background (expansion influence, mechanism unknown)**:  
   Non-Green shapes (e.g., Yellow in trains 1-3, Pink in trains 1 and 4, Red/Dark Red in train 3; always holes=0) consistently interact with the Maroon background by triggering expansions or merges in the output, where their input positions (bbox) determine the starting point for larger regions of the same color that fill or border Maroon areas. Unlike Greens, these shapes do not preserve exact bbox or pixels; instead, they influence Maroon fragmentation (outputs always show increased numbers of smaller Maroon components adjacent to these expanded regions). The exact transformation (e.g., direction of expansion or fill extent) is unknown and varies slightly by example, but the core interaction—position-driven influence on background subdivision—is consistent in every case.

No other connections (e.g., color-to-color effects like Green affecting Yellow, or hole counts beyond 0 influencing anything) are obvious or consistent across all examples. Elements like isolated small pixels or backgrounds without foreground ties show no interactions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 01:14:24] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 colors act as "seeds" to propagate their color into adjacent background cells along horizontal, vertical, and specific diagonal paths until blocked by non-background cells, iterated until stabilization. The goal is to simulate these expansions correctly to match expected filled patterns, likely representing growing shapes or patterns in a nonogram-like or flood-fill variant with directional constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically identified as the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/3/4, 0 in test); propagation only fills cells exactly matching this background value, stopping at any other color (including 3, which acts as a barrier but is not propagated from).
 * Only exact 2x2 blocks of the same color c (where c != background and c != 3) trigger propagation; blocks are found iteratively on the updating grid, and the process loops until no changes occur (with a safety limit like h*w iterations to prevent infinite loops).
 * Horizontal propagation: From a block at (r, k), fill left from column k-1 and right from k+2 on both rows r and r+1, only through background cells.
 * Vertical propagation: Fill up from row r-1 and down from r+2 on both columns k and k+1, only through background.
 * Diagonal propagations are corner-specific and directional: up-right starts adjacent to the block's top-right (from r-1, k+2, moving up-right); up-left from top-left adjacent (r-1, k-1, up-left); down-right from bottom-right (r+2, k+2, down-right); down-left from bottom-left (r+2, k-1, down-left). These are single-directional rays, not full flood-fills, and only fill background.
 * Order matters: Blocks are found and processed in sorted order (by row then column), and all propagations are applied per block before re-finding blocks, which can cause cascading effects; over-propagation happens if diagonals or iterations fill unintended areas.
 * Color 3 is a special barrier: It never seeds blocks and blocks propagation, but existing 3's remain unchanged.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, ~29x30 in test); empty or single-cell grids return unchanged.
 * Subtle issue: Diagonal starts are from positions *adjacent* to the block's corners (not inside the block), and only if those starting cells are background; propagation stops immediately if the starting cell isn't background.
 * Iterations must re-scan the entire grid each time, as new blocks can form from prior propagations (e.g., a 2x2 might emerge after horizontal fill creates alignment).
 * No overwriting: Only background cells are filled; if a propagation path hits a different color or 3, it stops without filling that cell.
 * Potential overreach: In complex grids, diagonals can create unexpected fills (e.g., chaining across multiple blocks), and the lack of blocking checks mid-diagonal can spill into areas that should remain background.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color as the most frequent value in the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful and correct for dynamic background detection, used in all attempts.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Find all 2x2 blocks of identical color c where c != bg and c != 3, returning sorted list of (row, col, c)."""
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This is helpful and core to identifying seeds correctly; sorting ensures consistent processing order.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    """Propagate color c horizontally left and right on both rows r and r+1 of the block, filling background cells until blocked."""
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        # left
        cc = k - 1
        while cc >= 0 and new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
            cc -= 1
        # right
        cc = k + 2
        while cc < w and new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
            cc += 1
    return changed

def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    """Propagate color c vertically up and down on both columns k and k+1 of the block, filling background cells until blocked."""
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0 and new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(These are helpful for straight-line propagations and correctly implement boundary checks and change tracking; essential for core mechanics.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it builds on implied prior ones; horizontal and vertical propagations work well where straight fills are needed (e.g., extending lines in training example 2 and 4, which passed).
 * Diagonal functions (apply_up_right, apply_up_left, apply_down_right, apply_down_left) are partially helpful but over-aggressive: They start from adjacent corner positions without checking if those starts are background or blocked, leading to incorrect fills (e.g., in training 1, they created a wide horizontal strip of 6's in row 21 columns 2-13, but expected has a narrower/more contained 6's pattern with 8's and 9/1 interrupting; in row 22, generated has 3,6,6,3 but expected shifts to include 6,8,9,1).
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated over-filled upper rows with 1's and 9's in inconsistent positions (e.g., row 0 generated [8,8,1,8,...] but expected starts with [8,8,8,8,...] and has 1's/4's shifted right; bottom rows show extra 6's spilling left/right beyond expected containment by 3's and 8's; also, row 20 generated has 8,3,3,3,3,... but expected has 8,3,3,3,3,... matching there, but row 21 diverges with extra 6's).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated propagated 2's horizontally/vertically too far (e.g., row 7 has long 2's strip to column 19, but expected limits 2's to specific positions like column 18 in row 1; also filled 7's in row 18/19 incorrectly as full strips, while expected has contained 7's in row 19 columns 5-7 and row 20 partial).
 * Training examples 2 and 4 (CORRECT) suggest the core loop and block-finding work for simpler cases without heavy diagonal interference, but the attempt fails on complex interactions.
 * The main program loop is helpful for iteration but breaks early if no blocks (good), yet in practice, it processes all diagonals per block without prioritizing, causing chains (e.g., a vertical fill might create a new block that diagonals exploit incorrectly).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs or shapes) are present or needed; the block-based approach is direct but misses that propagations might need to respect existing structures (e.g., 3's as hard stops).
 * Diagonal functions are not fully broken but unhelpful in current form due to lack of starting-cell checks (e.g., if the adjacent corner cell is already colored, no diagonal should start); suggest modifying to check new_g[starting_r][starting_c] == bg before the while loop.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 0 as background and propagates 4's diagonally in the top-left (e.g., creating a diagonal stair of 4's from row 0 col 1 to row 24 col 29-ish), and fills some 2's and 8's in mid-grid (e.g., row 7-9 has 8,2,2,8 blocks extended), but over-fills 7's in bottom-right (e.g., row 26 has long 7's from col 24-29, and row 27 spills 7's horizontally, which seems excessive without visible 2x2 seeds justifying it—mentally simulating, input has isolated 7's at bottom, no clear 2x2 for 7, so propagation shouldn't start; expected likely contains 7's more tightly around input positions like row 22 col 29).
 * Extra 8's in row 10-13 (e.g., row 11 has 8,3,3,8 extended to 8,4,4,8 but with fills around) look like vertical propagation from an 8 block, but input shows sparse 8's, so this might chain incorrectly from diagonals.
 * 3's in row 11-12 remain unchanged (correct, as barriers), but nearby 4's don't propagate through them properly (e.g., row 13 has 8,0,8,0 but output fills some 0's to 4's adjacent, which might be right if from a block, but test grid has no 2x2 4 there initially—suggests iteration created new blocks).
 * 2's in top-right (e.g., row 2 col 18-19) extend vertically/horizontally correctly to form lines, but diagonal up-left from them might incorrectly fill unrelated 0's in row 0-1.
 * Overall, output has too much filling in bottom (7's and 8's spilling into large areas), which doesn't match a mental run: Input has small 7 cluster at bottom-right without 2x2, so no propagation; top 4's and 2's should form contained diagonals/stairs without crossing the central 8/3 area. This indicates diagonals or iteration order is causing unintended cascades.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 01:14:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or flood-filling, where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 cells trigger propagation of that color along straight lines (horizontal, vertical) and possibly diagonals, filling adjacent background cells until blocked by other colors or 3s, with the goal of transforming the input grid to match an expected filled pattern. The background color is dynamically determined (e.g., most common cell value), and 3 appears to act as a special blocker or non-fillable element.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent cell value in the grid, but this may not always align with the expected output's dominant color (e.g., in Training 1, generated uses 9 as bg but expected uses 8, leading to over-filling with 9s instead of 8s).
 * 2x2 blocks are detected only if all four cells match a color c != bg and c != 3; blocks are sorted by row then column for processing order, which may affect iteration stability.
 * Propagation occurs from detected 2x2 blocks in multiple directions: horizontal (left/right from the block's rows, skipping over c or 3 but stopping at other colors), vertical (up/down from the block's columns), and four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) starting from each corner of the block, again filling only bg cells and stopping at non-c/non-3/non-bg.
 * The process iterates up to h*w times or until no blocks or changes occur, using a deepcopy to avoid mutating the original; however, applying propagations to all blocks in a single pass per iteration can cause over-filling or interference between blocks.
 * 3 cells are never filled or used as seeds but block propagation; other colors (e.g., 1,4,6,7,8,9) can be seeds or blockers depending on context.
 * Subtle element: Propagation does not fill within the 2x2 block itself (already filled) and starts strictly outside (e.g., horizontal from k-1 left and k+2 right); diagonals are one-directional from each corner and may not connect properly across the grid.
 * Grids can be irregular in shape/content (e.g., sparse with many 0s in test), and propagation must respect bounds without wrapping.
 * Order of processing blocks and directions matters; current top-to-bottom, left-to-right may miss dependencies where later blocks rely on earlier fills.
 * Easy to miss: Not all lines need full-grid spanning; partial fills stop at blockers, and multiple overlapping propagations from different blocks/colors must resolve without overwriting (current code allows it, leading to inconsistencies).
 * 0 may represent a special bg variant or empty, but treated as fillable like other bg; in test, excessive 0s remain unfilled or wrongly filled.
 * Iterations may loop inefficiently if new blocks form mid-process; current code re-finds blocks each iteration but applies to all at once.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as bg, useful for initialization, though it may need adjustment if bg isn't strictly most common.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by row then col
```
(This is helpful for detecting seed 2x2 blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent order.)

The apply_* functions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for directional filling logic, as they correctly skip over c/3 and stop at other colors while filling bg, but they are broken for multi-block interactions (e.g., they apply unconditionally per block without checking post-fill state, leading to overwrites).

No types like PuzzleElement are present, but tp.List[tp.List[int]] is a good type hint for grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects 2x2 blocks and attempts line-based propagation but fails overall due to incorrect bg choice or over-aggressive filling.
 * Training 1: Generated over-fills top rows with 9s (assuming 9 as bg) and scatters 1s/4s/6s/3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 has all 9s except ends with 1/8, but expected has mostly 8s with patterned 9/1/4/3/6); bottom sections have mismatched 6/3/8 placements (e.g., generated row 20 has 6,3,6,6,9,... but expected has 8,3,6,6,6,...); unknown why 8s appear sporadically instead of dominating as in expected.
 * Training 2: Generated fills almost entirely with 4s and leaves 3s isolated (e.g., row 2: [4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4] vs expected [8,3,3,4,3,8,8,8]), failing to propagate 8s as bg and expand shapes like the 3-triangle; bottom rows all 4s but expected has 4s only in specific positions with 8s elsewhere.
 * Training 3: Generated leaves large top areas as 2s (bg?) and poorly expands 3/4/7 patterns (e.g., row 5: [2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,...] with 8s filling bg areas); lower sections have fragmented 4/7/3 (e.g., row 11: [2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,2,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]), missing full 8-fills and shape completions.
 * Training 4: Generated mostly 6s with isolated 3s (e.g., row 2: [6,3,6,3,6,6,...] vs expected [8,3,6,3,6,8,...]), failing to introduce 8s as bg and expand the 3-pattern downward/rightward properly; bottom rows all 6s but expected has all 8s.
 * All trainings show under-filling of bg (e.g., 8s in expected) and incorrect color dominance; propagation seems to activate but doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., doesn't create the connected 8-regions or precise 3/4/6 blobs).
 * Function `program` is helpful as a main loop but broken in iteration logic (applies all propagations before re-checking blocks, causing chain reactions that overwrite expected patterns).
 * Diagonal functions are unhelpful or broken: they start from corners but don't connect lines properly (e.g., in Training 1, diagonals may cause stray 4s/1s not seen in expected straight-line fills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) is present, but it would be essential for identifying complete patterns beyond just 2x2 seeds; current code lacks blob detection or connectivity checks.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and directional fills but misses bg correctness, propagation stopping rules, and handling of multi-color interactions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves excessive 0s unfilled (e.g., most of the grid is still 0s, with sparse 4s along a diagonal-ish pattern in top-left, 2s scattered, and small 8/3/7 clusters in bottom-right), suggesting minimal propagation occurred—likely because bg=0 (most common) and few/no valid 2x2 blocks were detected or propagation stopped immediately due to blockers/3s.
 * It fails to create cohesive filled regions (e.g., the 8s in rows 6-7 and 25-28 are tiny and isolated, not expanding to cover bg areas as expected in trainings; 7s in bottom appear fragmented vs. potential full lines).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from trainings): Expected likely has a dominant bg (e.g., 0 or 8) filling large areas, with 2/4/3/7/8 propagating into shapes like lines or blobs from seeds, but generated has no such expansion—e.g., top rows have isolated 4s/2s but no horizontal/vertical fills connecting them, and bottom 7s don't form the connected patterns seen in training expectations.
 * Unknown why so many 0s persist (perhaps no 2x2 seeds at all, or propagation skips over 0s incorrectly); it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as it looks like a barely modified input rather than a completed pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python

    blocks = []
    h = len(g)

                g[r + 1][k] == c and

                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" connected regions starting from detected 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, filling adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until blocked by a different color, effectively completing patterns or shapes in a visual puzzle like a partial nonogram or blob expansion. The process iterates until no more changes occur, with background identified as the most common cell value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/4, likely 0 in test).
 * Expansion only triggers from 2x2 blocks of identical non-bg color; skips if block color is 3 (special case, perhaps a "fixed" or non-expandable color).
 * Fills must stop at boundaries: horizontal/vertical expand along rows/columns until hitting non-bg/non-matching color or edge; diagonals follow specific slopes (up-left: rr - (r - k), up-right: s - rr where s = r + (k+1), etc.) and stop similarly.
 * Iterations are bounded (h*w times) to prevent infinite loops, and blocks are sorted by (row, col) for consistent processing order.
 * Subtlety: Expansions can chain (one fill creates new 2x2 blocks for further fills), but the code processes all blocks in one pass before re-scanning, which may miss some chaining if not iterated fully.
 * Diagonal fills are asymmetric and direction-specific: up-left/down-right follow one diagonal slope, up-right/down-left follow the other; they only fill bg cells in the line, not branching.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal/vertical apply to both rows/columns of the 2x2 block simultaneously; diagonals start from the block's position but extend outward only (not inward, as the block is already filled).
 * Color 3 blocks are skipped entirely, preventing over-expansion of certain elements (seen in training 1 where 3's form fixed shapes).
 * Grids may have irregular patterns (e.g., scattered seeds like 2's in test), requiring multiple iterations to propagate fills correctly without overwriting existing non-bg cells.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills only if cell is bg or matches c, but breaks if non-matching non-bg, which is correct but can lead to incomplete fills if blocks overlap incorrectly.
 * No rotation or symmetry assumption; process top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode, essential for all fills; works in all examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects seed 2x2 blocks accurately; core to triggering expansions; reliable across examples.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # left
        cc = k - 1
        while cc >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
                break
            cc -= 1
        # right
        cc = k + 2
        while cc < w:
            if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
                break
            cc += 1
    return changed
```
(Handles row-wise expansion for the two rows of the block; works well for straight lines but note it skips the block itself (k to k+1).)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], k: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal but column-wise; effective for vertical propagation.)

(The diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are helpful for slope-based fills but have bugs in slope calculations, leading to off-diagonal paths in some cases; retain but fix indexing.)

(The main program loop with deepcopy, sorting blocks by (r,k), and iteration until no change is helpful for convergence, but max_iter = h*w may be too low for complex chaining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 2 and 4, expanding fills properly for 1's, 9's, 3's, 4's, 6's, and 7's in those cases without overfilling.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated misplaced 1's and 9's in the top half (e.g., row 0 has 1 at col 2 instead of expected empty 8's; bottom rows 20-23 have incorrect 6's positions, like row 20 col 2-6 as 6's but expected has 6's only in specific tapered shape starting row 21), and row 7 col 18 as 4 instead of expected 8; also duplicated 3's blocks without proper diagonal extension, leading to asymmetric fills (unknown why 6's appeared—possibly erroneous bg fill with wrong c).
 * Failed training example 3: Bottom half overfilled 7's into row 19 (full row of 7's but expected has partial 7's only in row 19 cols 5-7 and row 20 partial); top half failed to fill 2's correctly (e.g., row 2 col 18 as 8 instead of 2, row 6 col 13 as 2 but expected 8); 3's in row 13 col 14 as 4 instead of 3, suggesting diagonal functions misaligned or skipped valid blocks.
 * Successful cases (2 and 4) show horizontal/vertical fills work reliably for straight patterns, but diagonals may underperform in asymmetric grids.
 * Skipping c==3 blocks is helpful (prevents fixed shapes from expanding, correct in ex1/3), but may need generalization for other "seed" colors.
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; find_blocks is partial but useful—consider adding a full connected-component finder for post-fill validation.
 * Diagonal functions are broken in slope math (e.g., up-right uses s = r + (k+1), but for block at (r,k)-(r+1,k+1), it may not align with the anti-diagonal; leads to off-path fills in ex1/3); not fully helpful until fixed.
 * Overall, iteration loop converges correctly when directions align, but chaining fails in dense grids (ex1/3), and no handling for overlapping expansions causing color conflicts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (bg=0 correctly identified; 4's expanded along the main diagonal from rows 0-24 cols 0-24, filling bg to form a thick band; 2's filled horizontally/vertically in scattered positions like row 2 cols 18-19, row 6 col 21-25, and some diagonals; 8's filled a small block in rows 6-9 cols 22-25 and rows 24-27 cols 23-25; 3's in rows 11-12 cols 5-6 unchanged as expected since skipped).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Introduced erroneous 7's in bottom-right (rows 25-28 cols 24-29, forming a partial block, but input has no 7 seeds—possibly spillover from unhandled 2 or 8 expansion); overfilled 2's in row 22 col 29 as 7? (input has 7 there? Wait, input row 22 col 29=7, but generated has 7's spreading incorrectly); diagonal fills for 2's in row 2 col 28 as 2 (but input has 2 there, expected no spread); incomplete 8's in row 10 (only partial, missing vertical down to match input seeds); and row 13 col 4 as 8 but input has 8, yet no further diagonal to connect 3's. Differences suggest diagonal bugs cause misfills (e.g., 7's unknown origin—perhaps bg misdetect or c=7 from nowhere), and iterations didn't propagate 4's fully to connect bottom 7's; test needs more chaining and fixed diagonals to complete shapes without artifacts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 colors act as "seeds" to propagate their color into adjacent background cells along horizontal, vertical, and specific diagonal paths until blocked by non-background cells, iterated until stabilization. The goal is to simulate these expansions correctly to match expected filled patterns, likely representing growing shapes or patterns in a nonogram-like or flood-fill variant with directional constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically identified as the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/3/4, 0 in test); propagation only fills cells exactly matching this background value, stopping at any other color (including 3, which acts as a barrier but is not propagated from).
 * Only exact 2x2 blocks of the same color c (where c != background and c != 3) trigger propagation; blocks are found iteratively on the updating grid, and the process loops until no changes occur (with a safety limit like h*w iterations to prevent infinite loops).
 * Horizontal propagation: From a block at (r, k), fill left from column k-1 and right from k+2 on both rows r and r+1, only through background cells.
 * Vertical propagation: Fill up from row r-1 and down from r+2 on both columns k and k+1, only through background.
 * Diagonal propagations are corner-specific and directional: up-right starts adjacent to the block's top-right (from r-1, k+2, moving up-right); up-left from top-left adjacent (r-1, k-1, up-left); down-right from bottom-right (r+2, k+2, down-right); down-left from bottom-left (r+2, k-1, down-left). These are single-directional rays, not full flood-fills, and only fill background.
 * Order matters: Blocks are found and processed in sorted order (by row then column), and all propagations are applied per block before re-finding blocks, which can cause cascading effects; over-propagation happens if diagonals or iterations fill unintended areas.
 * Color 3 is a special barrier: It never seeds blocks and blocks propagation, but existing 3's remain unchanged.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, ~29x30 in test); empty or single-cell grids return unchanged.
 * Subtle issue: Diagonal starts are from positions *adjacent* to the block's corners (not inside the block), and only if those starting cells are background; propagation stops immediately if the starting cell isn't background.
 * Iterations must re-scan the entire grid each time, as new blocks can form from prior propagations (e.g., a 2x2 might emerge after horizontal fill creates alignment).
 * No overwriting: Only background cells are filled; if a propagation path hits a different color or 3, it stops without filling that cell.
 * Potential overreach: In complex grids, diagonals can create unexpected fills (e.g., chaining across multiple blocks), and the lack of blocking checks mid-diagonal can spill into areas that should remain background.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color as the most frequent value in the grid."""

(This is helpful and correct for dynamic background detection, used in all attempts.)

```python

            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:

    """Propagate color c vertically up and down on both columns k and k+1 of the block, filling background cells until blocked."""

            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(These are helpful for straight-line propagations and correctly implement boundary checks and change tracking; essential for core mechanics.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it builds on implied prior ones; horizontal and vertical propagations work well where straight fills are needed (e.g., extending lines in training example 2 and 4, which passed).
 * Diagonal functions (apply_up_right, apply_up_left, apply_down_right, apply_down_left) are partially helpful but over-aggressive: They start from adjacent corner positions without checking if those starts are background or blocked, leading to incorrect fills (e.g., in training 1, they created a wide horizontal strip of 6's in row 21 columns 2-13, but expected has a narrower/more contained 6's pattern with 8's and 9/1 interrupting; in row 22, generated has 3,6,6,3 but expected shifts to include 6,8,9,1).
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated over-filled upper rows with 1's and 9's in inconsistent positions (e.g., row 0 generated [8,8,1,8,...] but expected starts with [8,8,8,8,...] and has 1's/4's shifted right; bottom rows show extra 6's spilling left/right beyond expected containment by 3's and 8's; also, row 20 generated has 8,3,3,3,3,... but expected has 8,3,3,3,3,... matching there, but row 21 diverges with extra 6's).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated propagated 2's horizontally/vertically too far (e.g., row 7 has long 2's strip to column 19, but expected limits 2's to specific positions like column 18 in row 1; also filled 7's in row 18/19 incorrectly as full strips, while expected has contained 7's in row 19 columns 5-7 and row 20 partial).
 * Training examples 2 and 4 (CORRECT) suggest the core loop and block-finding work for simpler cases without heavy diagonal interference, but the attempt fails on complex interactions.
 * The main program loop is helpful for iteration but breaks early if no blocks (good), yet in practice, it processes all diagonals per block without prioritizing, causing chains (e.g., a vertical fill might create a new block that diagonals exploit incorrectly).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs or shapes) are present or needed; the block-based approach is direct but misses that propagations might need to respect existing structures (e.g., 3's as hard stops).
 * Diagonal functions are not fully broken but unhelpful in current form due to lack of starting-cell checks (e.g., if the adjacent corner cell is already colored, no diagonal should start); suggest modifying to check new_g[starting_r][starting_c] == bg before the while loop.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 0 as background and propagates 4's diagonally in the top-left (e.g., creating a diagonal stair of 4's from row 0 col 1 to row 24 col 29-ish), and fills some 2's and 8's in mid-grid (e.g., row 7-9 has 8,2,2,8 blocks extended), but over-fills 7's in bottom-right (e.g., row 26 has long 7's from col 24-29, and row 27 spills 7's horizontally, which seems excessive without visible 2x2 seeds justifying it—mentally simulating, input has isolated 7's at bottom, no clear 2x2 for 7, so propagation shouldn't start; expected likely contains 7's more tightly around input positions like row 22 col 29).
 * Extra 8's in row 10-13 (e.g., row 11 has 8,3,3,8 extended to 8,4,4,8 but with fills around) look like vertical propagation from an 8 block, but input shows sparse 8's, so this might chain incorrectly from diagonals.
 * 3's in row 11-12 remain unchanged (correct, as barriers), but nearby 4's don't propagate through them properly (e.g., row 13 has 8,0,8,0 but output fills some 0's to 4's adjacent, which might be right if from a block, but test grid has no 2x2 4 there initially—suggests iteration created new blocks).
 * 2's in top-right (e.g., row 2 col 18-19) extend vertically/horizontally correctly to form lines, but diagonal up-left from them might incorrectly fill unrelated 0's in row 0-1.
 * Overall, output has too much filling in bottom (7's and 8's spilling into large areas), which doesn't match a mental run: Input has small 7 cluster at bottom-right without 2x2, so no propagation; top 4's and 2's should form contained diagonals/stairs without crossing the central 8/3 area. This indicates diagonals or iteration order is causing unintended cascades.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-10-01 01:27:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based "growth" or "flood fill" mechanics where certain seed patterns (like 2x2 blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color) trigger expansion of colored regions into adjacent background cells along specific directions (horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal lines), ultimately filling predefined shapes or blobs while preserving existing structures and avoiding over-expansion or incorrect merging. The goal is to simulate iterative expansion until no more valid triggers exist, resulting in a final grid that matches expected filled patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value (e.g., 8 or 0), and expansions only overwrite background cells—never existing colors, 3's (which seem to act as barriers or fixed non-fillable elements), or other blocks.
 * Expansion triggers on 2x2 blocks of the same color c (excluding 3 and background), but only if they form a "corner" or seed for line-based growth; the program iterates until no new blocks are found, but must avoid infinite loops (capped at h*w iterations).
 * Directions for expansion include left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's edges, up/down vertical lines from its sides, and potentially diagonal lines (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) starting from the block's corners, but only filling consecutive background cells in straight lines without skipping or branching.
 * Subtlety: Expansions happen simultaneously across all detected blocks in each iteration (using a temp grid to avoid partial updates affecting others), and the process repeats until stabilization; however, diagonals must align precisely with the block's position (e.g., using sum/difference of row+col for anti/main diagonals) and stop at boundaries or non-background.
 * 3's are special: They block all expansions and are never overwritten or used as seeds, suggesting they are walls or outlines for shapes.
 * Patterns in expected outputs show "blobs" or shapes (e.g., letters/numbers formed by filling with a color like 6 into a 3-outlined area) and linear extensions (e.g., diagonals of 9-1 or horizontal 4's extending to edges).
 * Easy to miss: Not all directions always apply (e.g., some examples need vertical fill to top/bottom edges, others diagonal to connect shapes); over-filling occurs if diagonals are miscalculated (e.g., wrong starting sum s for diagonal lines); blocks must be sorted by position to process in order, but simultaneous application prevents order-dependence.
 * Iterations must propagate: A single 2x2 can create new 2x2's in subsequent iterations, leading to chain reactions (e.g., filling a long horizontal line that then seeds verticals).
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x8 in ex1, 8x8 in ex2), and empty rows/columns of background should remain unfilled unless triggered.
 * No merging of different colors; each block expands its own c independently.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background color, essential for all expansions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately, excluding 3's and background; sorting ensures consistent processing order.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
            cc = k - 1
            while 0 <= cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc -= 1
            cc = k + 2
            while cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc += 1
```
(This correctly fills left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's bottom/top edges into background.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> None:
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        rr = r - 1
        while 0 <= rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr -= 1
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr += 1
```
(This correctly fills up/down vertical lines from the 2x2's left/right sides into background.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = r + k + 1
    rr = r - 1
    while 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
        cc = s - rr
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr -= 1

def apply_diagonal_down_left(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = (r + 1) + k
    rr = r + 2
    while rr < h:
        cc = s - rr
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1

def apply_diagonal_up_left(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = r - k
    rr = r - 1
    while 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
        cc = rr - s
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr -= 1

def apply_diagonal_down_right(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = (r + 1) - (k + 1)
    rr = r + 2
    while rr < h:
        cc = rr - s
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1
```
(These are broken: Incorrect starting sums (s) lead to wrong diagonal alignments; e.g., up-right uses s = r + k + 1, which offsets incorrectly and causes over/under-filling or misalignment with block corners. They partially fill in some cases but fail to match expected linear diagonals, like the 9-1 patterns in ex1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 or 0) and detects 2x2 blocks, successfully triggering some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., in ex2, it fills some 4's horizontally but misses vertical extension to row 0; in ex4, it fills some 6's but misses top-row extension).
 * Horizontal and vertical applies work well for straight-line extensions (e.g., in ex1 bottom, partial 6-filling into the 3-outlined shape; in ex3, some 2/4/7 fills occur but don't propagate fully).
 * What didn't work: Diagonal functions are fundamentally flawed, causing incorrect or missing fills (e.g., in ex1, top diagonal 9-1 pattern is scattered/misplaced instead of clean vertical repetition; bottom 6's don't fully fill the shape due to poor diagonal chaining; in ex3, 2's and 7's don't extend to expected positions like row 0 col 6 or the 3-7 shape).
 * Iteration logic is mostly sound (uses temp_g for simultaneous updates, breaks on no change), but max_iter cap prevents infinite loops while allowing propagation; however, it over-applies in some spots (e.g., ex1 row 7 col 18 has extra 4 where expected has 8).
 * In ex1, generated has scattered 1's/9's in top rows (e.g., row 0: 8's with 1 at col2 and 9 at col15) vs. expected clean diagonal-like repetition of [9,1] blocks extending vertically; bottom 6's fill partially but leave gaps (e.g., row 20 col2=6 but expected has more structured 6's aligned with 3's).
 * In ex2, generated misses vertical 4-fill to row0 col3 (stays 8, expected=4) and doesn't fill row6 col0=4; partial horizontal 4's in row4 are correct but incomplete.
 * In ex3, generated leaves many areas unfilled (e.g., no 2's in top rows like expected row0 col18=2; 7's in bottom don't match exact shape; 4's in col13 are partial); 3's block correctly but expansions stop prematurely.
 * In ex4, generated misses vertical 6-fill to row0 col2/5 (stays 8, expected=6 at row6 col0 but wait, expected has 6 only at row6 col0? No, ex4 expected has 6 at row6 col0 but generated doesn't; actually ex4 generated matches most but misses row0 extensions).
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and line-fills but fails on diagonals and full propagation, leading to incomplete shapes (e.g., unfilled tops/bottoms in ex2/ex4); no extraction of "objects" or blobs attempted, which might help identify target shapes bounded by 3's.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; with 0 as background, it shows partial scattered fills (e.g., diagonal-ish 4's in top-left, some 2's along a near-diagonal in cols 17-29, 8's forming a small block in rows 7-10 cols 22-25, 3's/4's in rows 11-14 cols 4-13, and 7's filling a shape in bottom rows 24-28 cols 24-29 bounded by 8's), but it appears under-filled and misaligned compared to expected mechanics.
 * Issues: Top 4's don't extend fully horizontally/vertically (e.g., row0 col1=4 but no left/right fill into 0's); 2's are placed but don't chain into longer lines or fill shapes (e.g., row2 col28=2 isolated); 8-block in mid doesn't expand; bottom 7's fill some but leave gaps (e.g., row26 col25=7 but expected likely full horizontal/vertical into 0's); no clear propagation from 2x2 seeds to match shape outlines (e.g., potential 3-barriers around 7's not fully utilized); overall, it resembles the training errors with partial but incorrect expansions, suggesting diagonal bugs prevent proper test filling (e.g., the 2's look like attempted diagonal but offset wrong, and 7's don't reach edges like in ex2/4 expectations).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 01:27:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or flood-filling, where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 cells trigger propagation of that color along straight lines (horizontal, vertical) and possibly diagonals, filling adjacent background cells until blocked by other colors or 3s, with the goal of transforming the input grid to match an expected filled pattern. The background color is dynamically determined (e.g., most common cell value), and 3 appears to act as a special blocker or non-fillable element.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent cell value in the grid, but this may not always align with the expected output's dominant color (e.g., in Training 1, generated uses 9 as bg but expected uses 8, leading to over-filling with 9s instead of 8s).
 * 2x2 blocks are detected only if all four cells match a color c != bg and c != 3; blocks are sorted by row then column for processing order, which may affect iteration stability.
 * Propagation occurs from detected 2x2 blocks in multiple directions: horizontal (left/right from the block's rows, skipping over c or 3 but stopping at other colors), vertical (up/down from the block's columns), and four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) starting from each corner of the block, again filling only bg cells and stopping at non-c/non-3/non-bg.
 * The process iterates up to h*w times or until no blocks or changes occur, using a deepcopy to avoid mutating the original; however, applying propagations to all blocks in a single pass per iteration can cause over-filling or interference between blocks.
 * 3 cells are never filled or used as seeds but block propagation; other colors (e.g., 1,4,6,7,8,9) can be seeds or blockers depending on context.
 * Subtle element: Propagation does not fill within the 2x2 block itself (already filled) and starts strictly outside (e.g., horizontal from k-1 left and k+2 right); diagonals are one-directional from each corner and may not connect properly across the grid.
 * Grids can be irregular in shape/content (e.g., sparse with many 0s in test), and propagation must respect bounds without wrapping.
 * Order of processing blocks and directions matters; current top-to-bottom, left-to-right may miss dependencies where later blocks rely on earlier fills.
 * Easy to miss: Not all lines need full-grid spanning; partial fills stop at blockers, and multiple overlapping propagations from different blocks/colors must resolve without overwriting (current code allows it, leading to inconsistencies).
 * 0 may represent a special bg variant or empty, but treated as fillable like other bg; in test, excessive 0s remain unfilled or wrongly filled.
 * Iterations may loop inefficiently if new blocks form mid-process; current code re-finds blocks each iteration but applies to all at once.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as bg, useful for initialization, though it may need adjustment if bg isn't strictly most common.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by row then col
```
(This is helpful for detecting seed 2x2 blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent order.)

The apply_* functions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for directional filling logic, as they correctly skip over c/3 and stop at other colors while filling bg, but they are broken for multi-block interactions (e.g., they apply unconditionally per block without checking post-fill state, leading to overwrites).

No types like PuzzleElement are present, but tp.List[tp.List[int]] is a good type hint for grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects 2x2 blocks and attempts line-based propagation but fails overall due to incorrect bg choice or over-aggressive filling.
 * Training 1: Generated over-fills top rows with 9s (assuming 9 as bg) and scatters 1s/4s/6s/3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 has all 9s except ends with 1/8, but expected has mostly 8s with patterned 9/1/4/3/6); bottom sections have mismatched 6/3/8 placements (e.g., generated row 20 has 6,3,6,6,9,... but expected has 8,3,6,6,6,...); unknown why 8s appear sporadically instead of dominating as in expected.
 * Training 2: Generated fills almost entirely with 4s and leaves 3s isolated (e.g., row 2: [4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4] vs expected [8,3,3,4,3,8,8,8]), failing to propagate 8s as bg and expand shapes like the 3-triangle; bottom rows all 4s but expected has 4s only in specific positions with 8s elsewhere.
 * Training 3: Generated leaves large top areas as 2s (bg?) and poorly expands 3/4/7 patterns (e.g., row 5: [2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,...] with 8s filling bg areas); lower sections have fragmented 4/7/3 (e.g., row 11: [2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,2,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]), missing full 8-fills and shape completions.
 * Training 4: Generated mostly 6s with isolated 3s (e.g., row 2: [6,3,6,3,6,6,...] vs expected [8,3,6,3,6,8,...]), failing to introduce 8s as bg and expand the 3-pattern downward/rightward properly; bottom rows all 6s but expected has all 8s.
 * All trainings show under-filling of bg (e.g., 8s in expected) and incorrect color dominance; propagation seems to activate but doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., doesn't create the connected 8-regions or precise 3/4/6 blobs).
 * Function `program` is helpful as a main loop but broken in iteration logic (applies all propagations before re-checking blocks, causing chain reactions that overwrite expected patterns).
 * Diagonal functions are unhelpful or broken: they start from corners but don't connect lines properly (e.g., in Training 1, diagonals may cause stray 4s/1s not seen in expected straight-line fills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) is present, but it would be essential for identifying complete patterns beyond just 2x2 seeds; current code lacks blob detection or connectivity checks.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and directional fills but misses bg correctness, propagation stopping rules, and handling of multi-color interactions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves excessive 0s unfilled (e.g., most of the grid is still 0s, with sparse 4s along a diagonal-ish pattern in top-left, 2s scattered, and small 8/3/7 clusters in bottom-right), suggesting minimal propagation occurred—likely because bg=0 (most common) and few/no valid 2x2 blocks were detected or propagation stopped immediately due to blockers/3s.
 * It fails to create cohesive filled regions (e.g., the 8s in rows 6-7 and 25-28 are tiny and isolated, not expanding to cover bg areas as expected in trainings; 7s in bottom appear fragmented vs. potential full lines).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from trainings): Expected likely has a dominant bg (e.g., 0 or 8) filling large areas, with 2/4/3/7/8 propagating into shapes like lines or blobs from seeds, but generated has no such expansion—e.g., top rows have isolated 4s/2s but no horizontal/vertical fills connecting them, and bottom 7s don't form the connected patterns seen in training expectations.
 * Unknown why so many 0s persist (perhaps no 2x2 seeds at all, or propagation skips over 0s incorrectly); it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as it looks like a barely modified input rather than a completed pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based "growth" or "flood fill" mechanics where certain seed patterns (like 2x2 blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color) trigger expansion of colored regions into adjacent background cells along specific directions (horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal lines), ultimately filling predefined shapes or blobs while preserving existing structures and avoiding over-expansion or incorrect merging. The goal is to simulate iterative expansion until no more valid triggers exist, resulting in a final grid that matches expected filled patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value (e.g., 8 or 0), and expansions only overwrite background cells—never existing colors, 3's (which seem to act as barriers or fixed non-fillable elements), or other blocks.
 * Expansion triggers on 2x2 blocks of the same color c (excluding 3 and background), but only if they form a "corner" or seed for line-based growth; the program iterates until no new blocks are found, but must avoid infinite loops (capped at h*w iterations).
 * Directions for expansion include left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's edges, up/down vertical lines from its sides, and potentially diagonal lines (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) starting from the block's corners, but only filling consecutive background cells in straight lines without skipping or branching.
 * Subtlety: Expansions happen simultaneously across all detected blocks in each iteration (using a temp grid to avoid partial updates affecting others), and the process repeats until stabilization; however, diagonals must align precisely with the block's position (e.g., using sum/difference of row+col for anti/main diagonals) and stop at boundaries or non-background.
 * 3's are special: They block all expansions and are never overwritten or used as seeds, suggesting they are walls or outlines for shapes.
 * Patterns in expected outputs show "blobs" or shapes (e.g., letters/numbers formed by filling with a color like 6 into a 3-outlined area) and linear extensions (e.g., diagonals of 9-1 or horizontal 4's extending to edges).
 * Easy to miss: Not all directions always apply (e.g., some examples need vertical fill to top/bottom edges, others diagonal to connect shapes); over-filling occurs if diagonals are miscalculated (e.g., wrong starting sum s for diagonal lines); blocks must be sorted by position to process in order, but simultaneous application prevents order-dependence.
 * Iterations must propagate: A single 2x2 can create new 2x2's in subsequent iterations, leading to chain reactions (e.g., filling a long horizontal line that then seeds verticals).
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x8 in ex1, 8x8 in ex2), and empty rows/columns of background should remain unfilled unless triggered.
 * No merging of different colors; each block expands its own c independently.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background color, essential for all expansions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately, excluding 3's and background; sorting ensures consistent processing order.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
            cc = k - 1
            while 0 <= cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc -= 1
            cc = k + 2
            while cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc += 1
```
(This correctly fills left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's bottom/top edges into background.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> None:
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        rr = r - 1
        while 0 <= rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr -= 1
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr += 1
```
(This correctly fills up/down vertical lines from the 2x2's left/right sides into background.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = r + k + 1
    rr = r - 1
    while 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
        cc = s - rr
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr -= 1

def apply_diagonal_down_left(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:

    while rr < h:
        cc = s - rr
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1

def apply_diagonal_up_left(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = r - k
    rr = r - 1
    while 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
        cc = rr - s
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr -= 1

def apply_diagonal_down_right(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = (r + 1) - (k + 1)
    rr = r + 2
    while rr < h:
        cc = rr - s
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1
```
(These are broken: Incorrect starting sums (s) lead to wrong diagonal alignments; e.g., up-right uses s = r + k + 1, which offsets incorrectly and causes over/under-filling or misalignment with block corners. They partially fill in some cases but fail to match expected linear diagonals, like the 9-1 patterns in ex1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 or 0) and detects 2x2 blocks, successfully triggering some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., in ex2, it fills some 4's horizontally but misses vertical extension to row 0; in ex4, it fills some 6's but misses top-row extension).
 * Horizontal and vertical applies work well for straight-line extensions (e.g., in ex1 bottom, partial 6-filling into the 3-outlined shape; in ex3, some 2/4/7 fills occur but don't propagate fully).
 * What didn't work: Diagonal functions are fundamentally flawed, causing incorrect or missing fills (e.g., in ex1, top diagonal 9-1 pattern is scattered/misplaced instead of clean vertical repetition; bottom 6's don't fully fill the shape due to poor diagonal chaining; in ex3, 2's and 7's don't extend to expected positions like row 0 col 6 or the 3-7 shape).
 * Iteration logic is mostly sound (uses temp_g for simultaneous updates, breaks on no change), but max_iter cap prevents infinite loops while allowing propagation; however, it over-applies in some spots (e.g., ex1 row 7 col 18 has extra 4 where expected has 8).
 * In ex1, generated has scattered 1's/9's in top rows (e.g., row 0: 8's with 1 at col2 and 9 at col15) vs. expected clean diagonal-like repetition of [9,1] blocks extending vertically; bottom 6's fill partially but leave gaps (e.g., row 20 col2=6 but expected has more structured 6's aligned with 3's).
 * In ex2, generated misses vertical 4-fill to row0 col3 (stays 8, expected=4) and doesn't fill row6 col0=4; partial horizontal 4's in row4 are correct but incomplete.
 * In ex3, generated leaves many areas unfilled (e.g., no 2's in top rows like expected row0 col18=2; 7's in bottom don't match exact shape; 4's in col13 are partial); 3's block correctly but expansions stop prematurely.
 * In ex4, generated misses vertical 6-fill to row0 col2/5 (stays 8, expected=6 at row6 col0 but wait, expected has 6 only at row6 col0? No, ex4 expected has 6 at row6 col0 but generated doesn't; actually ex4 generated matches most but misses row0 extensions).
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and line-fills but fails on diagonals and full propagation, leading to incomplete shapes (e.g., unfilled tops/bottoms in ex2/ex4); no extraction of "objects" or blobs attempted, which might help identify target shapes bounded by 3's.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; with 0 as background, it shows partial scattered fills (e.g., diagonal-ish 4's in top-left, some 2's along a near-diagonal in cols 17-29, 8's forming a small block in rows 7-10 cols 22-25, 3's/4's in rows 11-14 cols 4-13, and 7's filling a shape in bottom rows 24-28 cols 24-29 bounded by 8's), but it appears under-filled and misaligned compared to expected mechanics.
 * Issues: Top 4's don't extend fully horizontally/vertically (e.g., row0 col1=4 but no left/right fill into 0's); 2's are placed but don't chain into longer lines or fill shapes (e.g., row2 col28=2 isolated); 8-block in mid doesn't expand; bottom 7's fill some but leave gaps (e.g., row26 col25=7 but expected likely full horizontal/vertical into 0's); no clear propagation from 2x2 seeds to match shape outlines (e.g., potential 3-barriers around 7's not fully utilized); overall, it resembles the training errors with partial but incorrect expansions, suggesting diagonal bugs prevent proper test filling (e.g., the 2's look like attempted diagonal but offset wrong, and 7's don't reach edges like in ex2/4 expectations).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:

            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" connected regions starting from detected 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, filling adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until blocked by a different color, effectively completing patterns or shapes in a visual puzzle like a partial nonogram or blob expansion. The process iterates until no more changes occur, with background identified as the most common cell value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/4, likely 0 in test).
 * Expansion only triggers from 2x2 blocks of identical non-bg color; skips if block color is 3 (special case, perhaps a "fixed" or non-expandable color).
 * Fills must stop at boundaries: horizontal/vertical expand along rows/columns until hitting non-bg/non-matching color or edge; diagonals follow specific slopes (up-left: rr - (r - k), up-right: s - rr where s = r + (k+1), etc.) and stop similarly.
 * Iterations are bounded (h*w times) to prevent infinite loops, and blocks are sorted by (row, col) for consistent processing order.
 * Subtlety: Expansions can chain (one fill creates new 2x2 blocks for further fills), but the code processes all blocks in one pass before re-scanning, which may miss some chaining if not iterated fully.
 * Diagonal fills are asymmetric and direction-specific: up-left/down-right follow one diagonal slope, up-right/down-left follow the other; they only fill bg cells in the line, not branching.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal/vertical apply to both rows/columns of the 2x2 block simultaneously; diagonals start from the block's position but extend outward only (not inward, as the block is already filled).
 * Color 3 blocks are skipped entirely, preventing over-expansion of certain elements (seen in training 1 where 3's form fixed shapes).
 * Grids may have irregular patterns (e.g., scattered seeds like 2's in test), requiring multiple iterations to propagate fills correctly without overwriting existing non-bg cells.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills only if cell is bg or matches c, but breaks if non-matching non-bg, which is correct but can lead to incomplete fills if blocks overlap incorrectly.
 * No rotation or symmetry assumption; process top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting.

    return blocks
```
(This detects seed 2x2 blocks accurately; core to triggering expansions; reliable across examples.)

def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:

                break
            cc += 1

```
(Handles row-wise expansion for the two rows of the block; works well for straight lines but note it skips the block itself (k to k+1).)

def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], k: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False

        while rr >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal but column-wise; effective for vertical propagation.)

(The diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are helpful for slope-based fills but have bugs in slope calculations, leading to off-diagonal paths in some cases; retain but fix indexing.)

(The main program loop with deepcopy, sorting blocks by (r,k), and iteration until no change is helpful for convergence, but max_iter = h*w may be too low for complex chaining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 2 and 4, expanding fills properly for 1's, 9's, 3's, 4's, 6's, and 7's in those cases without overfilling.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated misplaced 1's and 9's in the top half (e.g., row 0 has 1 at col 2 instead of expected empty 8's; bottom rows 20-23 have incorrect 6's positions, like row 20 col 2-6 as 6's but expected has 6's only in specific tapered shape starting row 21), and row 7 col 18 as 4 instead of expected 8; also duplicated 3's blocks without proper diagonal extension, leading to asymmetric fills (unknown why 6's appeared—possibly erroneous bg fill with wrong c).
 * Failed training example 3: Bottom half overfilled 7's into row 19 (full row of 7's but expected has partial 7's only in row 19 cols 5-7 and row 20 partial); top half failed to fill 2's correctly (e.g., row 2 col 18 as 8 instead of 2, row 6 col 13 as 2 but expected 8); 3's in row 13 col 14 as 4 instead of 3, suggesting diagonal functions misaligned or skipped valid blocks.
 * Successful cases (2 and 4) show horizontal/vertical fills work reliably for straight patterns, but diagonals may underperform in asymmetric grids.
 * Skipping c==3 blocks is helpful (prevents fixed shapes from expanding, correct in ex1/3), but may need generalization for other "seed" colors.
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; find_blocks is partial but useful—consider adding a full connected-component finder for post-fill validation.
 * Diagonal functions are broken in slope math (e.g., up-right uses s = r + (k+1), but for block at (r,k)-(r+1,k+1), it may not align with the anti-diagonal; leads to off-path fills in ex1/3); not fully helpful until fixed.
 * Overall, iteration loop converges correctly when directions align, but chaining fails in dense grids (ex1/3), and no handling for overlapping expansions causing color conflicts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (bg=0 correctly identified; 4's expanded along the main diagonal from rows 0-24 cols 0-24, filling bg to form a thick band; 2's filled horizontally/vertically in scattered positions like row 2 cols 18-19, row 6 col 21-25, and some diagonals; 8's filled a small block in rows 6-9 cols 22-25 and rows 24-27 cols 23-25; 3's in rows 11-12 cols 5-6 unchanged as expected since skipped).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Introduced erroneous 7's in bottom-right (rows 25-28 cols 24-29, forming a partial block, but input has no 7 seeds—possibly spillover from unhandled 2 or 8 expansion); overfilled 2's in row 22 col 29 as 7? (input has 7 there? Wait, input row 22 col 29=7, but generated has 7's spreading incorrectly); diagonal fills for 2's in row 2 col 28 as 2 (but input has 2 there, expected no spread); incomplete 8's in row 10 (only partial, missing vertical down to match input seeds); and row 13 col 4 as 8 but input has 8, yet no further diagonal to connect 3's. Differences suggest diagonal bugs cause misfills (e.g., 7's unknown origin—perhaps bg misdetect or c=7 from nowhere), and iterations didn't propagate 4's fully to connect bottom 7's; test needs more chaining and fixed diagonals to complete shapes without artifacts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 colors act as "seeds" to propagate their color into adjacent background cells along horizontal, vertical, and specific diagonal paths until blocked by non-background cells, iterated until stabilization. The goal is to simulate these expansions correctly to match expected filled patterns, likely representing growing shapes or patterns in a nonogram-like or flood-fill variant with directional constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically identified as the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/3/4, 0 in test); propagation only fills cells exactly matching this background value, stopping at any other color (including 3, which acts as a barrier but is not propagated from).
 * Only exact 2x2 blocks of the same color c (where c != background and c != 3) trigger propagation; blocks are found iteratively on the updating grid, and the process loops until no changes occur (with a safety limit like h*w iterations to prevent infinite loops).
 * Horizontal propagation: From a block at (r, k), fill left from column k-1 and right from k+2 on both rows r and r+1, only through background cells.
 * Vertical propagation: Fill up from row r-1 and down from r+2 on both columns k and k+1, only through background.
 * Diagonal propagations are corner-specific and directional: up-right starts adjacent to the block's top-right (from r-1, k+2, moving up-right); up-left from top-left adjacent (r-1, k-1, up-left); down-right from bottom-right (r+2, k+2, down-right); down-left from bottom-left (r+2, k-1, down-left). These are single-directional rays, not full flood-fills, and only fill background.
 * Order matters: Blocks are found and processed in sorted order (by row then column), and all propagations are applied per block before re-finding blocks, which can cause cascading effects; over-propagation happens if diagonals or iterations fill unintended areas.
 * Color 3 is a special barrier: It never seeds blocks and blocks propagation, but existing 3's remain unchanged.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, ~29x30 in test); empty or single-cell grids return unchanged.
 * Subtle issue: Diagonal starts are from positions *adjacent* to the block's corners (not inside the block), and only if those starting cells are background; propagation stops immediately if the starting cell isn't background.
 * Iterations must re-scan the entire grid each time, as new blocks can form from prior propagations (e.g., a 2x2 might emerge after horizontal fill creates alignment).
 * No overwriting: Only background cells are filled; if a propagation path hits a different color or 3, it stops without filling that cell.
 * Potential overreach: In complex grids, diagonals can create unexpected fills (e.g., chaining across multiple blocks), and the lack of blocking checks mid-diagonal can spill into areas that should remain background.

(These are helpful for straight-line propagations and correctly implement boundary checks and change tracking; essential for core mechanics.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it builds on implied prior ones; horizontal and vertical propagations work well where straight fills are needed (e.g., extending lines in training example 2 and 4, which passed).
 * Diagonal functions (apply_up_right, apply_up_left, apply_down_right, apply_down_left) are partially helpful but over-aggressive: They start from adjacent corner positions without checking if those starts are background or blocked, leading to incorrect fills (e.g., in training 1, they created a wide horizontal strip of 6's in row 21 columns 2-13, but expected has a narrower/more contained 6's pattern with 8's and 9/1 interrupting; in row 22, generated has 3,6,6,3 but expected shifts to include 6,8,9,1).
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated over-filled upper rows with 1's and 9's in inconsistent positions (e.g., row 0 generated [8,8,1,8,...] but expected starts with [8,8,8,8,...] and has 1's/4's shifted right; bottom rows show extra 6's spilling left/right beyond expected containment by 3's and 8's; also, row 20 generated has 8,3,3,3,3,... but expected has 8,3,3,3,3,... matching there, but row 21 diverges with extra 6's).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated propagated 2's horizontally/vertically too far (e.g., row 7 has long 2's strip to column 19, but expected limits 2's to specific positions like column 18 in row 1; also filled 7's in row 18/19 incorrectly as full strips, while expected has contained 7's in row 19 columns 5-7 and row 20 partial).
 * Training examples 2 and 4 (CORRECT) suggest the core loop and block-finding work for simpler cases without heavy diagonal interference, but the attempt fails on complex interactions.
 * The main program loop is helpful for iteration but breaks early if no blocks (good), yet in practice, it processes all diagonals per block without prioritizing, causing chains (e.g., a vertical fill might create a new block that diagonals exploit incorrectly).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs or shapes) are present or needed; the block-based approach is direct but misses that propagations might need to respect existing structures (e.g., 3's as hard stops).
 * Diagonal functions are not fully broken but unhelpful in current form due to lack of starting-cell checks (e.g., if the adjacent corner cell is already colored, no diagonal should start); suggest modifying to check new_g[starting_r][starting_c] == bg before the while loop.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 0 as background and propagates 4's diagonally in the top-left (e.g., creating a diagonal stair of 4's from row 0 col 1 to row 24 col 29-ish), and fills some 2's and 8's in mid-grid (e.g., row 7-9 has 8,2,2,8 blocks extended), but over-fills 7's in bottom-right (e.g., row 26 has long 7's from col 24-29, and row 27 spills 7's horizontally, which seems excessive without visible 2x2 seeds justifying it—mentally simulating, input has isolated 7's at bottom, no clear 2x2 for 7, so propagation shouldn't start; expected likely contains 7's more tightly around input positions like row 22 col 29).
 * Extra 8's in row 10-13 (e.g., row 11 has 8,3,3,8 extended to 8,4,4,8 but with fills around) look like vertical propagation from an 8 block, but input shows sparse 8's, so this might chain incorrectly from diagonals.
 * 3's in row 11-12 remain unchanged (correct, as barriers), but nearby 4's don't propagate through them properly (e.g., row 13 has 8,0,8,0 but output fills some 0's to 4's adjacent, which might be right if from a block, but test grid has no 2x2 4 there initially—suggests iteration created new blocks).
 * 2's in top-right (e.g., row 2 col 18-19) extend vertically/horizontally correctly to form lines, but diagonal up-left from them might incorrectly fill unrelated 0's in row 0-1.
 * Overall, output has too much filling in bottom (7's and 8's spilling into large areas), which doesn't match a mental run: Input has small 7 cluster at bottom-right without 2x2, so no propagation; top 4's and 2's should form contained diagonals/stairs without crossing the central 8/3 area. This indicates diagonals or iteration order is causing unintended cascades.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 01:37:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block detection and expansion, where 2x2 seeds of the same non-background, non-special (3) color trigger filling of adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until hitting obstacles or edges, simulating growth or flood-fill mechanics to complete patterns like shapes, lines, or borders. The process iterates until no more expansions occur, with background determined by the most common cell value, and special rules for handling extensions from endpoints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value (e.g., 8 in examples); all expansions only fill bg cells and stop at non-bg/non-matching-color cells, including color 3 which acts as a blocker and is excluded from seed detection.
 * Seeds are strictly 2x2 blocks of identical color c (not bg or 3); they must be detected in a loop until the grid stabilizes, processing blocks in row-column order.
 * Expansions include: full horizontal lines left/right from the 2x2 (filling bg in both rows of the block, with special downward diagonal extensions from the last filled point if blocked); vertical lines up/down from both columns; and four diagonal directions (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) filling bg along the line.
 * Subtle: Horizontal expansions have asymmetric endpoint handling—leftward stops and potentially extends down-left from the last bg filled, rightward extends down-right; vertical and diagonal are symmetric but stop immediately at any non-bg/non-c.
 * Color 3 is "solid" or immovable—never expands from it, and it blocks all fills; other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,6,7,9) can be seeds if forming 2x2 and expand into bg only.
 * Grid can have irregular widths/heights, but examples are rectangular; iterations must use deepcopy to compare changes, avoiding infinite loops.
 * Patterns often form borders, diagonals, or enclosed shapes (e.g., 6's forming a blob in train1, 2's diagonal in train3); over-filling or missing extensions leads to scattered/incorrect placements.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals use sum/difference coordinates (e.g., r+k constant for one diag, r-k for the other); horizontal extensions only affect the two rows of the seed, not full grid height; no wrapping around edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most common value; useful for all grids.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seeds excluding bg/3, sorts by position for consistent processing; essential for triggering expansions.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int):
    for col in (k, k + 1):
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0:
            if temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][col] = c
            elif temp_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][col] = c
            elif temp_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
```
(This handles vertical fills correctly from the two seed columns, skipping the seed rows themselves; helpful for line patterns.)

```python
def apply_diag_up_right(temp_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int):
    s = r + k + 1
    rr = r - 1
    while rr >= 0:
        cc = s - rr
        if cc < 0 or cc >= w:
            break
        if temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        elif temp_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        rr -= 1
```
(Example of diagonal fill using sum coordinate; similar for other diags—useful, but must ensure correct starting points beyond seed.)

 * Train1 incorrect: Generated scattered horizontal 1's in top rows (e.g., row0: 8's with 1's at positions 2,23; row6: misplaced 4's and 1's) instead of expected vertical/diagonal stack of repeating 9-1 pairs (e.g., column9-10 has 9,1 vertically across rows); bottom 6's form incorrect partial lines (e.g., row20 has 6's from col2-5,13 but expected has structured shape with 6's in col9-10 shifting); 3's and 4's partially match but overfilled (unknown reason for 6's misalignment, possibly horizontal over-extension).
 * Train2 correct: All expansions matched expected, indicating core loop and vertical/diagonal logic works for simple cases.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated extra 2's in bottom-left (e.g., row7 col0-6 all 2's, but expected has only partial); 7's overfilled horizontally in row19 (full row0-7=7, but expected limits to col0-7); vertical 4's and 3's mostly match but 2's diagonal incomplete (e.g., missing 2's in rows0-4 col18-19); 3's in row13 col11-13 filled as 3,3,3 but expected has 3,3,3,8 (wait, generated has 3,3,3,4—mismatch at end, possibly diag overfill).
 * Train4 correct: Handled complex interactions (e.g., multiple colors, blockers) without overfill, showing horizontal+down-diag from points works in some scenarios.
 * Overall: Iteration loop stabilizes correctly (no infinite), but horizontal apply_left/right often overfills or misplaces endpoints (e.g., last_filled extensions trigger unintended down-diags); diag functions skip seed cells properly but may start from wrong offset; excluding 3 from seeds is good, but 3 blocks all directions subtly (e.g., train1 3's frame 4's/6's without expanding into them).
 * Function apply_horizontal (and sub-left/right) is broken/not fully helpful: Complex endpoint logic leads to incorrect down-left/right triggers (e.g., fills bg beyond blockers in train1/3); simplify or debug last_filled conditions.
 * apply_diag_down_left/up_right etc. are helpful but subtle coord errors (e.g., s = r + k +1 starts after seed, but may clip edges wrong in train3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows scattered 4's along a near-diagonal in top-left (rows0-10 cols0-10), 2's in irregular positions (e.g., row2 col19=2, row3 col20=2, but sparse and not forming clean lines), 3's only in rows11-12 cols5-6/10-13 (limited, possibly under-expanded), 8's as apparent secondary bg or blocker in mid-right (rows7-10 cols22-25), and 7's overfilled in bottom-right (row26 cols24-29 all 7's, row27 cols24-25/27-29=7 but irregular). Expected likely forms structured patterns like bordered shapes or diagonals (e.g., 4's completing a frame, 2's as a clean diag line, 7's contained without spillover, using 0 as bg), but generated has fragmented fills and no clear enclosure—suggests horizontal/diagonal over/under-extension, especially around 8's/3's as blockers.
 * Missing cohesive shapes: Top 4's don't connect into expected vertical/diagonal borders (e.g., row10 col5-9=8's interrupt); bottom 7's spill horizontally beyond probable 8-blockers (row25 col23-29), unlike contained 7's in train3 expected.
 * 3's underfilled: Only two small blocks, but test input has potential for more expansion around rows11-14 cols4-14; unknown if 8's are treated as bg (misidentified?) or blockers.
 * Makes sense partially for seed detection (e.g., potential 2x2 4's trigger top fills), but overall fragmented—update horizontal endpoint logic and ensure diags respect all blockers to handle test's wider grid (30 cols) and mixed 0/8/3.

[2025-10-01 01:37:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or flood-filling, where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 cells trigger propagation of that color along straight lines (horizontal, vertical) and possibly diagonals, filling adjacent background cells until blocked by other colors or 3s, with the goal of transforming the input grid to match an expected filled pattern. The background color is dynamically determined (e.g., most common cell value), and 3 appears to act as a special blocker or non-fillable element.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent cell value in the grid, but this may not always align with the expected output's dominant color (e.g., in Training 1, generated uses 9 as bg but expected uses 8, leading to over-filling with 9s instead of 8s).
 * 2x2 blocks are detected only if all four cells match a color c != bg and c != 3; blocks are sorted by row then column for processing order, which may affect iteration stability.
 * Propagation occurs from detected 2x2 blocks in multiple directions: horizontal (left/right from the block's rows, skipping over c or 3 but stopping at other colors), vertical (up/down from the block's columns), and four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) starting from each corner of the block, again filling only bg cells and stopping at non-c/non-3/non-bg.
 * The process iterates up to h*w times or until no blocks or changes occur, using a deepcopy to avoid mutating the original; however, applying propagations to all blocks in a single pass per iteration can cause over-filling or interference between blocks.
 * 3 cells are never filled or used as seeds but block propagation; other colors (e.g., 1,4,6,7,8,9) can be seeds or blockers depending on context.
 * Subtle element: Propagation does not fill within the 2x2 block itself (already filled) and starts strictly outside (e.g., horizontal from k-1 left and k+2 right); diagonals are one-directional from each corner and may not connect properly across the grid.
 * Grids can be irregular in shape/content (e.g., sparse with many 0s in test), and propagation must respect bounds without wrapping.
 * Order of processing blocks and directions matters; current top-to-bottom, left-to-right may miss dependencies where later blocks rely on earlier fills.
 * Easy to miss: Not all lines need full-grid spanning; partial fills stop at blockers, and multiple overlapping propagations from different blocks/colors must resolve without overwriting (current code allows it, leading to inconsistencies).
 * 0 may represent a special bg variant or empty, but treated as fillable like other bg; in test, excessive 0s remain unfilled or wrongly filled.
 * Iterations may loop inefficiently if new blocks form mid-process; current code re-finds blocks each iteration but applies to all at once.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as bg, useful for initialization, though it may need adjustment if bg isn't strictly most common.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by row then col
```
(This is helpful for detecting seed 2x2 blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent order.)

The apply_* functions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for directional filling logic, as they correctly skip over c/3 and stop at other colors while filling bg, but they are broken for multi-block interactions (e.g., they apply unconditionally per block without checking post-fill state, leading to overwrites).

No types like PuzzleElement are present, but tp.List[tp.List[int]] is a good type hint for grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects 2x2 blocks and attempts line-based propagation but fails overall due to incorrect bg choice or over-aggressive filling.
 * Training 1: Generated over-fills top rows with 9s (assuming 9 as bg) and scatters 1s/4s/6s/3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 has all 9s except ends with 1/8, but expected has mostly 8s with patterned 9/1/4/3/6); bottom sections have mismatched 6/3/8 placements (e.g., generated row 20 has 6,3,6,6,9,... but expected has 8,3,6,6,6,...); unknown why 8s appear sporadically instead of dominating as in expected.
 * Training 2: Generated fills almost entirely with 4s and leaves 3s isolated (e.g., row 2: [4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4] vs expected [8,3,3,4,3,8,8,8]), failing to propagate 8s as bg and expand shapes like the 3-triangle; bottom rows all 4s but expected has 4s only in specific positions with 8s elsewhere.
 * Training 3: Generated leaves large top areas as 2s (bg?) and poorly expands 3/4/7 patterns (e.g., row 5: [2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,...] with 8s filling bg areas); lower sections have fragmented 4/7/3 (e.g., row 11: [2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,2,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]), missing full 8-fills and shape completions.
 * Training 4: Generated mostly 6s with isolated 3s (e.g., row 2: [6,3,6,3,6,6,...] vs expected [8,3,6,3,6,8,...]), failing to introduce 8s as bg and expand the 3-pattern downward/rightward properly; bottom rows all 6s but expected has all 8s.
 * All trainings show under-filling of bg (e.g., 8s in expected) and incorrect color dominance; propagation seems to activate but doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., doesn't create the connected 8-regions or precise 3/4/6 blobs).
 * Function `program` is helpful as a main loop but broken in iteration logic (applies all propagations before re-checking blocks, causing chain reactions that overwrite expected patterns).
 * Diagonal functions are unhelpful or broken: they start from corners but don't connect lines properly (e.g., in Training 1, diagonals may cause stray 4s/1s not seen in expected straight-line fills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) is present, but it would be essential for identifying complete patterns beyond just 2x2 seeds; current code lacks blob detection or connectivity checks.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and directional fills but misses bg correctness, propagation stopping rules, and handling of multi-color interactions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves excessive 0s unfilled (e.g., most of the grid is still 0s, with sparse 4s along a diagonal-ish pattern in top-left, 2s scattered, and small 8/3/7 clusters in bottom-right), suggesting minimal propagation occurred—likely because bg=0 (most common) and few/no valid 2x2 blocks were detected or propagation stopped immediately due to blockers/3s.
 * It fails to create cohesive filled regions (e.g., the 8s in rows 6-7 and 25-28 are tiny and isolated, not expanding to cover bg areas as expected in trainings; 7s in bottom appear fragmented vs. potential full lines).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from trainings): Expected likely has a dominant bg (e.g., 0 or 8) filling large areas, with 2/4/3/7/8 propagating into shapes like lines or blobs from seeds, but generated has no such expansion—e.g., top rows have isolated 4s/2s but no horizontal/vertical fills connecting them, and bottom 7s don't form the connected patterns seen in training expectations.
 * Unknown why so many 0s persist (perhaps no 2x2 seeds at all, or propagation skips over 0s incorrectly); it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as it looks like a barely modified input rather than a completed pattern.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based "growth" or "flood fill" mechanics where certain seed patterns (like 2x2 blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color) trigger expansion of colored regions into adjacent background cells along specific directions (horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal lines), ultimately filling predefined shapes or blobs while preserving existing structures and avoiding over-expansion or incorrect merging. The goal is to simulate iterative expansion until no more valid triggers exist, resulting in a final grid that matches expected filled patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value (e.g., 8 or 0), and expansions only overwrite background cells—never existing colors, 3's (which seem to act as barriers or fixed non-fillable elements), or other blocks.
 * Expansion triggers on 2x2 blocks of the same color c (excluding 3 and background), but only if they form a "corner" or seed for line-based growth; the program iterates until no new blocks are found, but must avoid infinite loops (capped at h*w iterations).
 * Directions for expansion include left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's edges, up/down vertical lines from its sides, and potentially diagonal lines (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) starting from the block's corners, but only filling consecutive background cells in straight lines without skipping or branching.
 * Subtlety: Expansions happen simultaneously across all detected blocks in each iteration (using a temp grid to avoid partial updates affecting others), and the process repeats until stabilization; however, diagonals must align precisely with the block's position (e.g., using sum/difference of row+col for anti/main diagonals) and stop at boundaries or non-background.
 * 3's are special: They block all expansions and are never overwritten or used as seeds, suggesting they are walls or outlines for shapes.
 * Patterns in expected outputs show "blobs" or shapes (e.g., letters/numbers formed by filling with a color like 6 into a 3-outlined area) and linear extensions (e.g., diagonals of 9-1 or horizontal 4's extending to edges).
 * Easy to miss: Not all directions always apply (e.g., some examples need vertical fill to top/bottom edges, others diagonal to connect shapes); over-filling occurs if diagonals are miscalculated (e.g., wrong starting sum s for diagonal lines); blocks must be sorted by position to process in order, but simultaneous application prevents order-dependence.
 * Iterations must propagate: A single 2x2 can create new 2x2's in subsequent iterations, leading to chain reactions (e.g., filling a long horizontal line that then seeds verticals).
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x8 in ex1, 8x8 in ex2), and empty rows/columns of background should remain unfilled unless triggered.
 * No merging of different colors; each block expands its own c independently.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background color, essential for all expansions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately, excluding 3's and background; sorting ensures consistent processing order.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
            cc = k - 1
            while 0 <= cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc -= 1
            cc = k + 2
            while cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc += 1
```
(This correctly fills left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's bottom/top edges into background.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> None:
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        rr = r - 1
        while 0 <= rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr -= 1
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr += 1
```
(This correctly fills up/down vertical lines from the 2x2's left/right sides into background.)

        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1
```
(These are broken: Incorrect starting sums (s) lead to wrong diagonal alignments; e.g., up-right uses s = r + k + 1, which offsets incorrectly and causes over/under-filling or misalignment with block corners. They partially fill in some cases but fail to match expected linear diagonals, like the 9-1 patterns in ex1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 or 0) and detects 2x2 blocks, successfully triggering some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., in ex2, it fills some 4's horizontally but misses vertical extension to row 0; in ex4, it fills some 6's but misses top-row extension).
 * Horizontal and vertical applies work well for straight-line extensions (e.g., in ex1 bottom, partial 6-filling into the 3-outlined shape; in ex3, some 2/4/7 fills occur but don't propagate fully).
 * What didn't work: Diagonal functions are fundamentally flawed, causing incorrect or missing fills (e.g., in ex1, top diagonal 9-1 pattern is scattered/misplaced instead of clean vertical repetition; bottom 6's don't fully fill the shape due to poor diagonal chaining; in ex3, 2's and 7's don't extend to expected positions like row 0 col 6 or the 3-7 shape).
 * Iteration logic is mostly sound (uses temp_g for simultaneous updates, breaks on no change), but max_iter cap prevents infinite loops while allowing propagation; however, it over-applies in some spots (e.g., ex1 row 7 col 18 has extra 4 where expected has 8).
 * In ex1, generated has scattered 1's/9's in top rows (e.g., row 0: 8's with 1 at col2 and 9 at col15) vs. expected clean diagonal-like repetition of [9,1] blocks extending vertically; bottom 6's fill partially but leave gaps (e.g., row 20 col2=6 but expected has more structured 6's aligned with 3's).
 * In ex2, generated misses vertical 4-fill to row0 col3 (stays 8, expected=4) and doesn't fill row6 col0=4; partial horizontal 4's in row4 are correct but incomplete.
 * In ex3, generated leaves many areas unfilled (e.g., no 2's in top rows like expected row0 col18=2; 7's in bottom don't match exact shape; 4's in col13 are partial); 3's block correctly but expansions stop prematurely.
 * In ex4, generated misses vertical 6-fill to row0 col2/5 (stays 8, expected=6 at row6 col0 but wait, expected has 6 only at row6 col0? No, ex4 expected has 6 at row6 col0 but generated doesn't; actually ex4 generated matches most but misses row0 extensions).
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and line-fills but fails on diagonals and full propagation, leading to incomplete shapes (e.g., unfilled tops/bottoms in ex2/ex4); no extraction of "objects" or blobs attempted, which might help identify target shapes bounded by 3's.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; with 0 as background, it shows partial scattered fills (e.g., diagonal-ish 4's in top-left, some 2's along a near-diagonal in cols 17-29, 8's forming a small block in rows 7-10 cols 22-25, 3's/4's in rows 11-14 cols 4-13, and 7's filling a shape in bottom rows 24-28 cols 24-29 bounded by 8's), but it appears under-filled and misaligned compared to expected mechanics.
 * Issues: Top 4's don't extend fully horizontally/vertically (e.g., row0 col1=4 but no left/right fill into 0's); 2's are placed but don't chain into longer lines or fill shapes (e.g., row2 col28=2 isolated); 8-block in mid doesn't expand; bottom 7's fill some but leave gaps (e.g., row26 col25=7 but expected likely full horizontal/vertical into 0's); no clear propagation from 2x2 seeds to match shape outlines (e.g., potential 3-barriers around 7's not fully utilized); overall, it resembles the training errors with partial but incorrect expansions, suggesting diagonal bugs prevent proper test filling (e.g., the 2's look like attempted diagonal but offset wrong, and 7's don't reach edges like in ex2/4 expectations).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if (c != bg and
                g[r][k + 1] == c and
                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" connected regions starting from detected 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, filling adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until blocked by a different color, effectively completing patterns or shapes in a visual puzzle like a partial nonogram or blob expansion. The process iterates until no more changes occur, with background identified as the most common cell value.

 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/4, likely 0 in test).
 * Expansion only triggers from 2x2 blocks of identical non-bg color; skips if block color is 3 (special case, perhaps a "fixed" or non-expandable color).
 * Fills must stop at boundaries: horizontal/vertical expand along rows/columns until hitting non-bg/non-matching color or edge; diagonals follow specific slopes (up-left: rr - (r - k), up-right: s - rr where s = r + (k+1), etc.) and stop similarly.
 * Iterations are bounded (h*w times) to prevent infinite loops, and blocks are sorted by (row, col) for consistent processing order.
 * Subtlety: Expansions can chain (one fill creates new 2x2 blocks for further fills), but the code processes all blocks in one pass before re-scanning, which may miss some chaining if not iterated fully.
 * Diagonal fills are asymmetric and direction-specific: up-left/down-right follow one diagonal slope, up-right/down-left follow the other; they only fill bg cells in the line, not branching.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal/vertical apply to both rows/columns of the 2x2 block simultaneously; diagonals start from the block's position but extend outward only (not inward, as the block is already filled).
 * Color 3 blocks are skipped entirely, preventing over-expansion of certain elements (seen in training 1 where 3's form fixed shapes).
 * Grids may have irregular patterns (e.g., scattered seeds like 2's in test), requiring multiple iterations to propagate fills correctly without overwriting existing non-bg cells.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills only if cell is bg or matches c, but breaks if non-matching non-bg, which is correct but can lead to incomplete fills if blocks overlap incorrectly.
 * No rotation or symmetry assumption; process top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode, essential for all fills; works in all examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:

            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects seed 2x2 blocks accurately; core to triggering expansions; reliable across examples.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # left
        cc = k - 1
        while cc >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
                break
            cc -= 1
        # right
        cc = k + 2
        while cc < w:

                break
            cc += 1
    return changed
```
(Handles row-wise expansion for the two rows of the block; works well for straight lines but note it skips the block itself (k to k+1).)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], k: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal but column-wise; effective for vertical propagation.)

(The diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are helpful for slope-based fills but have bugs in slope calculations, leading to off-diagonal paths in some cases; retain but fix indexing.)

(The main program loop with deepcopy, sorting blocks by (r,k), and iteration until no change is helpful for convergence, but max_iter = h*w may be too low for complex chaining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 2 and 4, expanding fills properly for 1's, 9's, 3's, 4's, 6's, and 7's in those cases without overfilling.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated misplaced 1's and 9's in the top half (e.g., row 0 has 1 at col 2 instead of expected empty 8's; bottom rows 20-23 have incorrect 6's positions, like row 20 col 2-6 as 6's but expected has 6's only in specific tapered shape starting row 21), and row 7 col 18 as 4 instead of expected 8; also duplicated 3's blocks without proper diagonal extension, leading to asymmetric fills (unknown why 6's appeared—possibly erroneous bg fill with wrong c).
 * Failed training example 3: Bottom half overfilled 7's into row 19 (full row of 7's but expected has partial 7's only in row 19 cols 5-7 and row 20 partial); top half failed to fill 2's correctly (e.g., row 2 col 18 as 8 instead of 2, row 6 col 13 as 2 but expected 8); 3's in row 13 col 14 as 4 instead of 3, suggesting diagonal functions misaligned or skipped valid blocks.
 * Successful cases (2 and 4) show horizontal/vertical fills work reliably for straight patterns, but diagonals may underperform in asymmetric grids.
 * Skipping c==3 blocks is helpful (prevents fixed shapes from expanding, correct in ex1/3), but may need generalization for other "seed" colors.
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; find_blocks is partial but useful—consider adding a full connected-component finder for post-fill validation.
 * Diagonal functions are broken in slope math (e.g., up-right uses s = r + (k+1), but for block at (r,k)-(r+1,k+1), it may not align with the anti-diagonal; leads to off-path fills in ex1/3); not fully helpful until fixed.
 * Overall, iteration loop converges correctly when directions align, but chaining fails in dense grids (ex1/3), and no handling for overlapping expansions causing color conflicts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (bg=0 correctly identified; 4's expanded along the main diagonal from rows 0-24 cols 0-24, filling bg to form a thick band; 2's filled horizontally/vertically in scattered positions like row 2 cols 18-19, row 6 col 21-25, and some diagonals; 8's filled a small block in rows 6-9 cols 22-25 and rows 24-27 cols 23-25; 3's in rows 11-12 cols 5-6 unchanged as expected since skipped).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Introduced erroneous 7's in bottom-right (rows 25-28 cols 24-29, forming a partial block, but input has no 7 seeds—possibly spillover from unhandled 2 or 8 expansion); overfilled 2's in row 22 col 29 as 7? (input has 7 there? Wait, input row 22 col 29=7, but generated has 7's spreading incorrectly); diagonal fills for 2's in row 2 col 28 as 2 (but input has 2 there, expected no spread); incomplete 8's in row 10 (only partial, missing vertical down to match input seeds); and row 13 col 4 as 8 but input has 8, yet no further diagonal to connect 3's. Differences suggest diagonal bugs cause misfills (e.g., 7's unknown origin—perhaps bg misdetect or c=7 from nowhere), and iterations didn't propagate 4's fully to connect bottom 7's; test needs more chaining and fixed diagonals to complete shapes without artifacts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 colors act as "seeds" to propagate their color into adjacent background cells along horizontal, vertical, and specific diagonal paths until blocked by non-background cells, iterated until stabilization. The goal is to simulate these expansions correctly to match expected filled patterns, likely representing growing shapes or patterns in a nonogram-like or flood-fill variant with directional constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically identified as the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/3/4, 0 in test); propagation only fills cells exactly matching this background value, stopping at any other color (including 3, which acts as a barrier but is not propagated from).
 * Only exact 2x2 blocks of the same color c (where c != background and c != 3) trigger propagation; blocks are found iteratively on the updating grid, and the process loops until no changes occur (with a safety limit like h*w iterations to prevent infinite loops).
 * Horizontal propagation: From a block at (r, k), fill left from column k-1 and right from k+2 on both rows r and r+1, only through background cells.
 * Vertical propagation: Fill up from row r-1 and down from r+2 on both columns k and k+1, only through background.
 * Diagonal propagations are corner-specific and directional: up-right starts adjacent to the block's top-right (from r-1, k+2, moving up-right); up-left from top-left adjacent (r-1, k-1, up-left); down-right from bottom-right (r+2, k+2, down-right); down-left from bottom-left (r+2, k-1, down-left). These are single-directional rays, not full flood-fills, and only fill background.
 * Order matters: Blocks are found and processed in sorted order (by row then column), and all propagations are applied per block before re-finding blocks, which can cause cascading effects; over-propagation happens if diagonals or iterations fill unintended areas.
 * Color 3 is a special barrier: It never seeds blocks and blocks propagation, but existing 3's remain unchanged.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, ~29x30 in test); empty or single-cell grids return unchanged.
 * Subtle issue: Diagonal starts are from positions *adjacent* to the block's corners (not inside the block), and only if those starting cells are background; propagation stops immediately if the starting cell isn't background.
 * Iterations must re-scan the entire grid each time, as new blocks can form from prior propagations (e.g., a 2x2 might emerge after horizontal fill creates alignment).
 * No overwriting: Only background cells are filled; if a propagation path hits a different color or 3, it stops without filling that cell.
 * Potential overreach: In complex grids, diagonals can create unexpected fills (e.g., chaining across multiple blocks), and the lack of blocking checks mid-diagonal can spill into areas that should remain background.

            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(These are helpful for straight-line propagations and correctly implement boundary checks and change tracking; essential for core mechanics.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it builds on implied prior ones; horizontal and vertical propagations work well where straight fills are needed (e.g., extending lines in training example 2 and 4, which passed).
 * Diagonal functions (apply_up_right, apply_up_left, apply_down_right, apply_down_left) are partially helpful but over-aggressive: They start from adjacent corner positions without checking if those starts are background or blocked, leading to incorrect fills (e.g., in training 1, they created a wide horizontal strip of 6's in row 21 columns 2-13, but expected has a narrower/more contained 6's pattern with 8's and 9/1 interrupting; in row 22, generated has 3,6,6,3 but expected shifts to include 6,8,9,1).
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated over-filled upper rows with 1's and 9's in inconsistent positions (e.g., row 0 generated [8,8,1,8,...] but expected starts with [8,8,8,8,...] and has 1's/4's shifted right; bottom rows show extra 6's spilling left/right beyond expected containment by 3's and 8's; also, row 20 generated has 8,3,3,3,3,... but expected has 8,3,3,3,3,... matching there, but row 21 diverges with extra 6's).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated propagated 2's horizontally/vertically too far (e.g., row 7 has long 2's strip to column 19, but expected limits 2's to specific positions like column 18 in row 1; also filled 7's in row 18/19 incorrectly as full strips, while expected has contained 7's in row 19 columns 5-7 and row 20 partial).
 * Training examples 2 and 4 (CORRECT) suggest the core loop and block-finding work for simpler cases without heavy diagonal interference, but the attempt fails on complex interactions.
 * The main program loop is helpful for iteration but breaks early if no blocks (good), yet in practice, it processes all diagonals per block without prioritizing, causing chains (e.g., a vertical fill might create a new block that diagonals exploit incorrectly).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs or shapes) are present or needed; the block-based approach is direct but misses that propagations might need to respect existing structures (e.g., 3's as hard stops).
 * Diagonal functions are not fully broken but unhelpful in current form due to lack of starting-cell checks (e.g., if the adjacent corner cell is already colored, no diagonal should start); suggest modifying to check new_g[starting_r][starting_c] == bg before the while loop.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 0 as background and propagates 4's diagonally in the top-left (e.g., creating a diagonal stair of 4's from row 0 col 1 to row 24 col 29-ish), and fills some 2's and 8's in mid-grid (e.g., row 7-9 has 8,2,2,8 blocks extended), but over-fills 7's in bottom-right (e.g., row 26 has long 7's from col 24-29, and row 27 spills 7's horizontally, which seems excessive without visible 2x2 seeds justifying it—mentally simulating, input has isolated 7's at bottom, no clear 2x2 for 7, so propagation shouldn't start; expected likely contains 7's more tightly around input positions like row 22 col 29).
 * Extra 8's in row 10-13 (e.g., row 11 has 8,3,3,8 extended to 8,4,4,8 but with fills around) look like vertical propagation from an 8 block, but input shows sparse 8's, so this might chain incorrectly from diagonals.
 * 3's in row 11-12 remain unchanged (correct, as barriers), but nearby 4's don't propagate through them properly (e.g., row 13 has 8,0,8,0 but output fills some 0's to 4's adjacent, which might be right if from a block, but test grid has no 2x2 4 there initially—suggests iteration created new blocks).
 * 2's in top-right (e.g., row 2 col 18-19) extend vertically/horizontally correctly to form lines, but diagonal up-left from them might incorrectly fill unrelated 0's in row 0-1.
 * Overall, output has too much filling in bottom (7's and 8's spilling into large areas), which doesn't match a mental run: Input has small 7 cluster at bottom-right without 2x2, so no propagation; top 4's and 2's should form contained diagonals/stairs without crossing the central 8/3 area. This indicates diagonals or iteration order is causing unintended cascades.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block detection and expansion, where 2x2 seeds of the same non-background, non-special (3) color trigger filling of adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until hitting obstacles or edges, simulating growth or flood-fill mechanics to complete patterns like shapes, lines, or borders. The process iterates until no more expansions occur, with background determined by the most common cell value, and special rules for handling extensions from endpoints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value (e.g., 8 in examples); all expansions only fill bg cells and stop at non-bg/non-matching-color cells, including color 3 which acts as a blocker and is excluded from seed detection.
 * Seeds are strictly 2x2 blocks of identical color c (not bg or 3); they must be detected in a loop until the grid stabilizes, processing blocks in row-column order.
 * Expansions include: full horizontal lines left/right from the 2x2 (filling bg in both rows of the block, with special downward diagonal extensions from the last filled point if blocked); vertical lines up/down from both columns; and four diagonal directions (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) filling bg along the line.
 * Subtle: Horizontal expansions have asymmetric endpoint handling—leftward stops and potentially extends down-left from the last bg filled, rightward extends down-right; vertical and diagonal are symmetric but stop immediately at any non-bg/non-c.
 * Color 3 is "solid" or immovable—never expands from it, and it blocks all fills; other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,6,7,9) can be seeds if forming 2x2 and expand into bg only.
 * Grid can have irregular widths/heights, but examples are rectangular; iterations must use deepcopy to compare changes, avoiding infinite loops.
 * Patterns often form borders, diagonals, or enclosed shapes (e.g., 6's forming a blob in train1, 2's diagonal in train3); over-filling or missing extensions leads to scattered/incorrect placements.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals use sum/difference coordinates (e.g., r+k constant for one diag, r-k for the other); horizontal extensions only affect the two rows of the seed, not full grid height; no wrapping around edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most common value; useful for all grids.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seeds excluding bg/3, sorts by position for consistent processing; essential for triggering expansions.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int):
    for col in (k, k + 1):
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0:
            if temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][col] = c
            elif temp_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][col] = c
            elif temp_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
```
(This handles vertical fills correctly from the two seed columns, skipping the seed rows themselves; helpful for line patterns.)

```python
def apply_diag_up_right(temp_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int):
    s = r + k + 1
    rr = r - 1
    while rr >= 0:
        cc = s - rr
        if cc < 0 or cc >= w:
            break
        if temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        elif temp_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        rr -= 1
```
(Example of diagonal fill using sum coordinate; similar for other diags—useful, but must ensure correct starting points beyond seed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated scattered horizontal 1's in top rows (e.g., row0: 8's with 1's at positions 2,23; row6: misplaced 4's and 1's) instead of expected vertical/diagonal stack of repeating 9-1 pairs (e.g., column9-10 has 9,1 vertically across rows); bottom 6's form incorrect partial lines (e.g., row20 has 6's from col2-5,13 but expected has structured shape with 6's in col9-10 shifting); 3's and 4's partially match but overfilled (unknown reason for 6's misalignment, possibly horizontal over-extension).
 * Train2 correct: All expansions matched expected, indicating core loop and vertical/diagonal logic works for simple cases.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated extra 2's in bottom-left (e.g., row7 col0-6 all 2's, but expected has only partial); 7's overfilled horizontally in row19 (full row0-7=7, but expected limits to col0-7); vertical 4's and 3's mostly match but 2's diagonal incomplete (e.g., missing 2's in rows0-4 col18-19); 3's in row13 col11-13 filled as 3,3,3 but expected has 3,3,3,8 (wait, generated has 3,3,3,4—mismatch at end, possibly diag overfill).
 * Train4 correct: Handled complex interactions (e.g., multiple colors, blockers) without overfill, showing horizontal+down-diag from points works in some scenarios.
 * Overall: Iteration loop stabilizes correctly (no infinite), but horizontal apply_left/right often overfills or misplaces endpoints (e.g., last_filled extensions trigger unintended down-diags); diag functions skip seed cells properly but may start from wrong offset; excluding 3 from seeds is good, but 3 blocks all directions subtly (e.g., train1 3's frame 4's/6's without expanding into them).
 * Function apply_horizontal (and sub-left/right) is broken/not fully helpful: Complex endpoint logic leads to incorrect down-left/right triggers (e.g., fills bg beyond blockers in train1/3); simplify or debug last_filled conditions.
 * apply_diag_down_left/up_right etc. are helpful but subtle coord errors (e.g., s = r + k +1 starts after seed, but may clip edges wrong in train3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows scattered 4's along a near-diagonal in top-left (rows0-10 cols0-10), 2's in irregular positions (e.g., row2 col19=2, row3 col20=2, but sparse and not forming clean lines), 3's only in rows11-12 cols5-6/10-13 (limited, possibly under-expanded), 8's as apparent secondary bg or blocker in mid-right (rows7-10 cols22-25), and 7's overfilled in bottom-right (row26 cols24-29 all 7's, row27 cols24-25/27-29=7 but irregular). Expected likely forms structured patterns like bordered shapes or diagonals (e.g., 4's completing a frame, 2's as a clean diag line, 7's contained without spillover, using 0 as bg), but generated has fragmented fills and no clear enclosure—suggests horizontal/diagonal over/under-extension, especially around 8's/3's as blockers.
 * Missing cohesive shapes: Top 4's don't connect into expected vertical/diagonal borders (e.g., row10 col5-9=8's interrupt); bottom 7's spill horizontally beyond probable 8-blockers (row25 col23-29), unlike contained 7's in train3 expected.
 * 3's underfilled: Only two small blocks, but test input has potential for more expansion around rows11-14 cols4-14; unknown if 8's are treated as bg (misidentified?) or blockers.
 * Makes sense partially for seed detection (e.g., potential 2x2 4's trigger top fills), but overall fragmented—update horizontal endpoint logic and ensure diags respect all blockers to handle test's wider grid (30 cols) and mixed 0/8/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-10-01 01:49:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving pattern recognition and propagation, where the goal is to fill "fillable" cells (background color or a special filler like 8) based on detected 2x2 "seed" blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color, extending fills horizontally, vertically, and possibly diagonally without overwriting non-fillable cells, iterating until stable. The rules aim to complete symmetric or structured patterns (e.g., shapes, lines, or blobs) while preserving fixed elements like 3's (which seem to act as barriers) and avoiding overfilling or introducing invalid colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most common cell value; fillable cells are bg plus 8 (if present and != bg), but fills propagate a seed's color (c) into these without changing non-fillable cells (e.g., 3's block everything, other colors may not).
 * 2x2 seeds are detected only if all four cells match c (where c != 3 and c not in fillable); seeds must be sorted by position for consistent processing.
 * Fills happen in passes: horizontal (extend left/right from seed columns in seed rows ±1), vertical (extend up/down from seed rows in seed columns ±1), and diagonals (extend along lines from seed corners), but only into consecutive fillable cells; no wrapping or crossing barriers.
 * Iteration continues until no changes or max iterations (to prevent infinite loops), but must use a temp grid to avoid mid-pass overwrites affecting later seeds.
 * Subtle: 3's are absolute barriers (no fill into or through them); diagonals are tricky—up-left/down-right use one slope (rr - cc constant), up-right/down-left use the other (rr + cc constant)—but implementations often miscalculate offsets, leading to off-grid or wrong-line fills.
 * Patterns often involve symmetry (e.g., mirrored shapes, borders), and overfilling happens if diagonals or extensions ignore boundaries; 8 may be a temporary filler that gets overwritten.
 * Easy to miss: Seeds can be created dynamically during iteration (new 2x2's from prior fills trigger more), but only process existing seeds per pass; avoid filling into areas that would create invalid new seeds; some colors (e.g., 6 in ex1, 2 in ex3) should form specific blobs/lines, not flood entire regions.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes, empty grids (return as-is), and ensure output matches exact expected patterns without extra changes.
 * Considerations from attempts: Horizontal/vertical work well for straight lines but fail on curves/angles; diagonals are often broken (wrong starting points or slopes); no handling for multi-seed interactions or priority (e.g., process top-left first); max_iter = h*w prevents loops but may stop early; 8's role as fillable but overridable is key, but code sometimes treats it as permanent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color using Counter; essential for fillable set and is reliable across examples.)

```python
def get_fillable(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.Set[int]:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    counter = Counter(flat)
    fillable = {bg}
    if 8 in counter and 8 != bg:
        fillable.add(8)
    return fillable
```
(Helpful for defining what can be overwritten; captures the special role of 8 as a temporary/secondary fillable, but note: in iteration, new fills use seed c, so fillable is checked dynamically.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], fillable: tp.Set[int]) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != 3 and c not in fillable and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(Core detection of 2x2 seeds; works well for identifying propagation starters, sorts for consistency; essential but misses dynamic seeds if not re-found each iter.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, fillable: tp.Set[int], w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if 0 <= rr < len(g):
            # left
            cc = k - 1
            while cc >= 0 and g[rr][cc] in fillable:
                g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
                cc -= 1
            # right
            cc = k + 2
            while cc < w and g[rr][cc] in fillable:
                g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
                cc += 1
    return changed
```
(Helpful for row-wise extensions; correctly skips the seed itself and barriers; works in ex2/4 but needs pairing with vertical for full lines.)

```python
def apply_vertical(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, fillable: tp.Set[int], h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0 and g[rr][col] in fillable:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and g[rr][col] in fillable:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal; good for column fills, essential for vertical patterns in ex3; reliable if diagonals are fixed separately.)

(The four diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are broken or unhelpful: they use incorrect slope calculations (e.g., s = r - k for up-left often goes off-line; up-right uses r + k +1 which misaligns; down functions start at r+2 but wrong offsets like s = (r+1) - (k+1) fail to follow diagonals properly). They cause overfills or misses in ex1/ex3 (e.g., wrong positions filled with 6's or 2's); do not use in future—redesign with proper diagonal traversal (e.g., loop along rr ±1, cc ±1 matching slope).)

(The main program loop is helpful for iteration and temp grid usage to avoid race conditions, but max_iter = h*w is arbitrary and may truncate; sorting blocks ensures order but doesn't handle seed dependencies well.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training ex1 INCORRECT: Generated overfilled bottom with 6's (e.g., row20 has full 6's row, but expected has sparse 6's in columns 2-5,8; row21 has 6's in col8 but expected none); top rows have misplaced 1's/9's (e.g., row0 col16=9 but expected 8; row20 col2-5=3's correct but 6's wrong); differences suggest diagonal bugs created false extensions, and horizontal/vertical overpropagated without stopping at 3's/edges; unknown why 6's flooded instead of forming small blob.
 * Training ex2 CORRECT: All fills matched (e.g., proper line extensions from seeds); horizontal/vertical worked perfectly, no overfill.
 * Training ex3 INCORRECT: Generated filled upper areas with 2's where expected 8's (e.g., rows0-4 all 8's expected but generated has 2's leaking up? Wait, generated rows0-5 are 8's but row6 has 3's and 8's correct, but row7 has long 2's row where expected shorter 2's in cols0-6; bottom row19 has 3,7,7,3 but expected 3,7,7,3—no, row18 has 7's blob but generated row7 has extra 2's extending right; row13 has 3,3,3,4 but expected 3,3,3,8; differences: vertical fills from 2-seed in row7 overextended rightward into non-fillable? And missed filling 2's in sparse positions like row0 col18=2 expected but generated 8.
 * Training ex4 CORRECT: Matched exactly, likely simple seeds with clean h/v fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal/vertical functions are solid for straight propagations but insufficient alone (need better diagonals for angles); iteration finds new seeds but processes all at once via temp, causing order issues; find_blocks misses if seeds overlap or are created mid-iter without refind; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs) attempted, but could help validate shapes; unhelpful: diagonal functions consistently wrong, leading to 50% failure rate.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It starts with uniform 2's in top 9 rows (plausible if 2 is bg), but then introduces irregular 4's in a near-checkerboard pattern from row9 onward (e.g., row9 has 4's at cols9,11-12,14; row10 has 4's block but interrupted), escalating to dense 4's and 7's in lower rows, and unexpectedly adds 0's (e.g., row27 col22=0, row28 col21=0, row29 col20=0,22=0)—0's are likely invalid (not in input colors, suggests bug like off-grid access or uninitialized fill). This doesn't match puzzle logic: fills should propagate cleanly from 2x2 seeds (visible 3's/4's/7's suggest seeds there), forming structured shapes (e.g., borders or blobs like in training), not chaotic checkerboard or introducing new colors; overfilling with 4's/7's ignores barriers (e.g., 3's in row11-12 should block), and 0's indicate index errors in extensions; expected likely has sparse, symmetric fills (e.g., extending 4's into 2's bg without 0's or checker patterns)—test fails due to broken diagonals creating false propagations and no bounds checks.

[2025-10-01 01:49:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or flood-filling, where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 cells trigger propagation of that color along straight lines (horizontal, vertical) and possibly diagonals, filling adjacent background cells until blocked by other colors or 3s, with the goal of transforming the input grid to match an expected filled pattern. The background color is dynamically determined (e.g., most common cell value), and 3 appears to act as a special blocker or non-fillable element.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent cell value in the grid, but this may not always align with the expected output's dominant color (e.g., in Training 1, generated uses 9 as bg but expected uses 8, leading to over-filling with 9s instead of 8s).
 * 2x2 blocks are detected only if all four cells match a color c != bg and c != 3; blocks are sorted by row then column for processing order, which may affect iteration stability.
 * Propagation occurs from detected 2x2 blocks in multiple directions: horizontal (left/right from the block's rows, skipping over c or 3 but stopping at other colors), vertical (up/down from the block's columns), and four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) starting from each corner of the block, again filling only bg cells and stopping at non-c/non-3/non-bg.
 * The process iterates up to h*w times or until no blocks or changes occur, using a deepcopy to avoid mutating the original; however, applying propagations to all blocks in a single pass per iteration can cause over-filling or interference between blocks.
 * 3 cells are never filled or used as seeds but block propagation; other colors (e.g., 1,4,6,7,8,9) can be seeds or blockers depending on context.
 * Subtle element: Propagation does not fill within the 2x2 block itself (already filled) and starts strictly outside (e.g., horizontal from k-1 left and k+2 right); diagonals are one-directional from each corner and may not connect properly across the grid.
 * Grids can be irregular in shape/content (e.g., sparse with many 0s in test), and propagation must respect bounds without wrapping.
 * Order of processing blocks and directions matters; current top-to-bottom, left-to-right may miss dependencies where later blocks rely on earlier fills.
 * Easy to miss: Not all lines need full-grid spanning; partial fills stop at blockers, and multiple overlapping propagations from different blocks/colors must resolve without overwriting (current code allows it, leading to inconsistencies).
 * 0 may represent a special bg variant or empty, but treated as fillable like other bg; in test, excessive 0s remain unfilled or wrongly filled.
 * Iterations may loop inefficiently if new blocks form mid-process; current code re-finds blocks each iteration but applies to all at once.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as bg, useful for initialization, though it may need adjustment if bg isn't strictly most common.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by row then col
```
(This is helpful for detecting seed 2x2 blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent order.)

The apply_* functions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for directional filling logic, as they correctly skip over c/3 and stop at other colors while filling bg, but they are broken for multi-block interactions (e.g., they apply unconditionally per block without checking post-fill state, leading to overwrites).

No types like PuzzleElement are present, but tp.List[tp.List[int]] is a good type hint for grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects 2x2 blocks and attempts line-based propagation but fails overall due to incorrect bg choice or over-aggressive filling.
 * Training 1: Generated over-fills top rows with 9s (assuming 9 as bg) and scatters 1s/4s/6s/3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 has all 9s except ends with 1/8, but expected has mostly 8s with patterned 9/1/4/3/6); bottom sections have mismatched 6/3/8 placements (e.g., generated row 20 has 6,3,6,6,9,... but expected has 8,3,6,6,6,...); unknown why 8s appear sporadically instead of dominating as in expected.
 * Training 2: Generated fills almost entirely with 4s and leaves 3s isolated (e.g., row 2: [4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4] vs expected [8,3,3,4,3,8,8,8]), failing to propagate 8s as bg and expand shapes like the 3-triangle; bottom rows all 4s but expected has 4s only in specific positions with 8s elsewhere.
 * Training 3: Generated leaves large top areas as 2s (bg?) and poorly expands 3/4/7 patterns (e.g., row 5: [2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,...] with 8s filling bg areas); lower sections have fragmented 4/7/3 (e.g., row 11: [2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,2,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]), missing full 8-fills and shape completions.
 * Training 4: Generated mostly 6s with isolated 3s (e.g., row 2: [6,3,6,3,6,6,...] vs expected [8,3,6,3,6,8,...]), failing to introduce 8s as bg and expand the 3-pattern downward/rightward properly; bottom rows all 6s but expected has all 8s.
 * All trainings show under-filling of bg (e.g., 8s in expected) and incorrect color dominance; propagation seems to activate but doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., doesn't create the connected 8-regions or precise 3/4/6 blobs).
 * Function `program` is helpful as a main loop but broken in iteration logic (applies all propagations before re-checking blocks, causing chain reactions that overwrite expected patterns).
 * Diagonal functions are unhelpful or broken: they start from corners but don't connect lines properly (e.g., in Training 1, diagonals may cause stray 4s/1s not seen in expected straight-line fills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) is present, but it would be essential for identifying complete patterns beyond just 2x2 seeds; current code lacks blob detection or connectivity checks.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and directional fills but misses bg correctness, propagation stopping rules, and handling of multi-color interactions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves excessive 0s unfilled (e.g., most of the grid is still 0s, with sparse 4s along a diagonal-ish pattern in top-left, 2s scattered, and small 8/3/7 clusters in bottom-right), suggesting minimal propagation occurred—likely because bg=0 (most common) and few/no valid 2x2 blocks were detected or propagation stopped immediately due to blockers/3s.
 * It fails to create cohesive filled regions (e.g., the 8s in rows 6-7 and 25-28 are tiny and isolated, not expanding to cover bg areas as expected in trainings; 7s in bottom appear fragmented vs. potential full lines).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from trainings): Expected likely has a dominant bg (e.g., 0 or 8) filling large areas, with 2/4/3/7/8 propagating into shapes like lines or blobs from seeds, but generated has no such expansion—e.g., top rows have isolated 4s/2s but no horizontal/vertical fills connecting them, and bottom 7s don't form the connected patterns seen in training expectations.
 * Unknown why so many 0s persist (perhaps no 2x2 seeds at all, or propagation skips over 0s incorrectly); it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as it looks like a barely modified input rather than a completed pattern.

**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based "growth" or "flood fill" mechanics where certain seed patterns (like 2x2 blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color) trigger expansion of colored regions into adjacent background cells along specific directions (horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal lines), ultimately filling predefined shapes or blobs while preserving existing structures and avoiding over-expansion or incorrect merging. The goal is to simulate iterative expansion until no more valid triggers exist, resulting in a final grid that matches expected filled patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value (e.g., 8 or 0), and expansions only overwrite background cells—never existing colors, 3's (which seem to act as barriers or fixed non-fillable elements), or other blocks.
 * Expansion triggers on 2x2 blocks of the same color c (excluding 3 and background), but only if they form a "corner" or seed for line-based growth; the program iterates until no new blocks are found, but must avoid infinite loops (capped at h*w iterations).
 * Directions for expansion include left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's edges, up/down vertical lines from its sides, and potentially diagonal lines (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) starting from the block's corners, but only filling consecutive background cells in straight lines without skipping or branching.
 * Subtlety: Expansions happen simultaneously across all detected blocks in each iteration (using a temp grid to avoid partial updates affecting others), and the process repeats until stabilization; however, diagonals must align precisely with the block's position (e.g., using sum/difference of row+col for anti/main diagonals) and stop at boundaries or non-background.
 * 3's are special: They block all expansions and are never overwritten or used as seeds, suggesting they are walls or outlines for shapes.
 * Patterns in expected outputs show "blobs" or shapes (e.g., letters/numbers formed by filling with a color like 6 into a 3-outlined area) and linear extensions (e.g., diagonals of 9-1 or horizontal 4's extending to edges).
 * Easy to miss: Not all directions always apply (e.g., some examples need vertical fill to top/bottom edges, others diagonal to connect shapes); over-filling occurs if diagonals are miscalculated (e.g., wrong starting sum s for diagonal lines); blocks must be sorted by position to process in order, but simultaneous application prevents order-dependence.
 * Iterations must propagate: A single 2x2 can create new 2x2's in subsequent iterations, leading to chain reactions (e.g., filling a long horizontal line that then seeds verticals).
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x8 in ex1, 8x8 in ex2), and empty rows/columns of background should remain unfilled unless triggered.
 * No merging of different colors; each block expands its own c independently.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background color, essential for all expansions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately, excluding 3's and background; sorting ensures consistent processing order.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
            cc = k - 1
            while 0 <= cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc -= 1
            cc = k + 2
            while cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc += 1
```
(This correctly fills left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's bottom/top edges into background.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> None:
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        rr = r - 1
        while 0 <= rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr -= 1
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr += 1
```
(This correctly fills up/down vertical lines from the 2x2's left/right sides into background.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = r + k + 1
    rr = r - 1
    while 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
        cc = s - rr
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr -= 1

def apply_diagonal_down_left(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = (r + 1) + k
    rr = r + 2
    while rr < h:
        cc = s - rr
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1

def apply_diagonal_up_left(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = r - k
    rr = r - 1
    while 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
        cc = rr - s
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr -= 1

def apply_diagonal_down_right(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = (r + 1) - (k + 1)
    rr = r + 2
    while rr < h:
        cc = rr - s
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1
```
(These are broken: Incorrect starting sums (s) lead to wrong diagonal alignments; e.g., up-right uses s = r + k + 1, which offsets incorrectly and causes over/under-filling or misalignment with block corners. They partially fill in some cases but fail to match expected linear diagonals, like the 9-1 patterns in ex1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 or 0) and detects 2x2 blocks, successfully triggering some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., in ex2, it fills some 4's horizontally but misses vertical extension to row 0; in ex4, it fills some 6's but misses top-row extension).
 * Horizontal and vertical applies work well for straight-line extensions (e.g., in ex1 bottom, partial 6-filling into the 3-outlined shape; in ex3, some 2/4/7 fills occur but don't propagate fully).
 * What didn't work: Diagonal functions are fundamentally flawed, causing incorrect or missing fills (e.g., in ex1, top diagonal 9-1 pattern is scattered/misplaced instead of clean vertical repetition; bottom 6's don't fully fill the shape due to poor diagonal chaining; in ex3, 2's and 7's don't extend to expected positions like row 0 col 6 or the 3-7 shape).
 * Iteration logic is mostly sound (uses temp_g for simultaneous updates, breaks on no change), but max_iter cap prevents infinite loops while allowing propagation; however, it over-applies in some spots (e.g., ex1 row 7 col 18 has extra 4 where expected has 8).
 * In ex1, generated has scattered 1's/9's in top rows (e.g., row 0: 8's with 1 at col2 and 9 at col15) vs. expected clean diagonal-like repetition of [9,1] blocks extending vertically; bottom 6's fill partially but leave gaps (e.g., row 20 col2=6 but expected has more structured 6's aligned with 3's).
 * In ex2, generated misses vertical 4-fill to row0 col3 (stays 8, expected=4) and doesn't fill row6 col0=4; partial horizontal 4's in row4 are correct but incomplete.
 * In ex3, generated leaves many areas unfilled (e.g., no 2's in top rows like expected row0 col18=2; 7's in bottom don't match exact shape; 4's in col13 are partial); 3's block correctly but expansions stop prematurely.
 * In ex4, generated misses vertical 6-fill to row0 col2/5 (stays 8, expected=6 at row6 col0 but wait, expected has 6 only at row6 col0? No, ex4 expected has 6 at row6 col0 but generated doesn't; actually ex4 generated matches most but misses row0 extensions).
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and line-fills but fails on diagonals and full propagation, leading to incomplete shapes (e.g., unfilled tops/bottoms in ex2/ex4); no extraction of "objects" or blobs attempted, which might help identify target shapes bounded by 3's.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; with 0 as background, it shows partial scattered fills (e.g., diagonal-ish 4's in top-left, some 2's along a near-diagonal in cols 17-29, 8's forming a small block in rows 7-10 cols 22-25, 3's/4's in rows 11-14 cols 4-13, and 7's filling a shape in bottom rows 24-28 cols 24-29 bounded by 8's), but it appears under-filled and misaligned compared to expected mechanics.
 * Issues: Top 4's don't extend fully horizontally/vertically (e.g., row0 col1=4 but no left/right fill into 0's); 2's are placed but don't chain into longer lines or fill shapes (e.g., row2 col28=2 isolated); 8-block in mid doesn't expand; bottom 7's fill some but leave gaps (e.g., row26 col25=7 but expected likely full horizontal/vertical into 0's); no clear propagation from 2x2 seeds to match shape outlines (e.g., potential 3-barriers around 7's not fully utilized); overall, it resembles the training errors with partial but incorrect expansions, suggesting diagonal bugs prevent proper test filling (e.g., the 2's look like attempted diagonal but offset wrong, and 7's don't reach edges like in ex2/4 expectations).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if (c != bg and
                g[r][k + 1] == c and
                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" connected regions starting from detected 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, filling adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until blocked by a different color, effectively completing patterns or shapes in a visual puzzle like a partial nonogram or blob expansion. The process iterates until no more changes occur, with background identified as the most common cell value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/4, likely 0 in test).
 * Expansion only triggers from 2x2 blocks of identical non-bg color; skips if block color is 3 (special case, perhaps a "fixed" or non-expandable color).
 * Fills must stop at boundaries: horizontal/vertical expand along rows/columns until hitting non-bg/non-matching color or edge; diagonals follow specific slopes (up-left: rr - (r - k), up-right: s - rr where s = r + (k+1), etc.) and stop similarly.
 * Iterations are bounded (h*w times) to prevent infinite loops, and blocks are sorted by (row, col) for consistent processing order.
 * Subtlety: Expansions can chain (one fill creates new 2x2 blocks for further fills), but the code processes all blocks in one pass before re-scanning, which may miss some chaining if not iterated fully.
 * Diagonal fills are asymmetric and direction-specific: up-left/down-right follow one diagonal slope, up-right/down-left follow the other; they only fill bg cells in the line, not branching.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal/vertical apply to both rows/columns of the 2x2 block simultaneously; diagonals start from the block's position but extend outward only (not inward, as the block is already filled).
 * Color 3 blocks are skipped entirely, preventing over-expansion of certain elements (seen in training 1 where 3's form fixed shapes).
 * Grids may have irregular patterns (e.g., scattered seeds like 2's in test), requiring multiple iterations to propagate fills correctly without overwriting existing non-bg cells.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills only if cell is bg or matches c, but breaks if non-matching non-bg, which is correct but can lead to incomplete fills if blocks overlap incorrectly.
 * No rotation or symmetry assumption; process top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting.

(This detects seed 2x2 blocks accurately; core to triggering expansions; reliable across examples.)

(Handles row-wise expansion for the two rows of the block; works well for straight lines but note it skips the block itself (k to k+1).)

                break
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal but column-wise; effective for vertical propagation.)

(The diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are helpful for slope-based fills but have bugs in slope calculations, leading to off-diagonal paths in some cases; retain but fix indexing.)

(The main program loop with deepcopy, sorting blocks by (r,k), and iteration until no change is helpful for convergence, but max_iter = h*w may be too low for complex chaining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 2 and 4, expanding fills properly for 1's, 9's, 3's, 4's, 6's, and 7's in those cases without overfilling.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated misplaced 1's and 9's in the top half (e.g., row 0 has 1 at col 2 instead of expected empty 8's; bottom rows 20-23 have incorrect 6's positions, like row 20 col 2-6 as 6's but expected has 6's only in specific tapered shape starting row 21), and row 7 col 18 as 4 instead of expected 8; also duplicated 3's blocks without proper diagonal extension, leading to asymmetric fills (unknown why 6's appeared—possibly erroneous bg fill with wrong c).
 * Failed training example 3: Bottom half overfilled 7's into row 19 (full row of 7's but expected has partial 7's only in row 19 cols 5-7 and row 20 partial); top half failed to fill 2's correctly (e.g., row 2 col 18 as 8 instead of 2, row 6 col 13 as 2 but expected 8); 3's in row 13 col 14 as 4 instead of 3, suggesting diagonal functions misaligned or skipped valid blocks.
 * Successful cases (2 and 4) show horizontal/vertical fills work reliably for straight patterns, but diagonals may underperform in asymmetric grids.
 * Skipping c==3 blocks is helpful (prevents fixed shapes from expanding, correct in ex1/3), but may need generalization for other "seed" colors.
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; find_blocks is partial but useful—consider adding a full connected-component finder for post-fill validation.
 * Diagonal functions are broken in slope math (e.g., up-right uses s = r + (k+1), but for block at (r,k)-(r+1,k+1), it may not align with the anti-diagonal; leads to off-path fills in ex1/3); not fully helpful until fixed.
 * Overall, iteration loop converges correctly when directions align, but chaining fails in dense grids (ex1/3), and no handling for overlapping expansions causing color conflicts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (bg=0 correctly identified; 4's expanded along the main diagonal from rows 0-24 cols 0-24, filling bg to form a thick band; 2's filled horizontally/vertically in scattered positions like row 2 cols 18-19, row 6 col 21-25, and some diagonals; 8's filled a small block in rows 6-9 cols 22-25 and rows 24-27 cols 23-25; 3's in rows 11-12 cols 5-6 unchanged as expected since skipped).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Introduced erroneous 7's in bottom-right (rows 25-28 cols 24-29, forming a partial block, but input has no 7 seeds—possibly spillover from unhandled 2 or 8 expansion); overfilled 2's in row 22 col 29 as 7? (input has 7 there? Wait, input row 22 col 29=7, but generated has 7's spreading incorrectly); diagonal fills for 2's in row 2 col 28 as 2 (but input has 2 there, expected no spread); incomplete 8's in row 10 (only partial, missing vertical down to match input seeds); and row 13 col 4 as 8 but input has 8, yet no further diagonal to connect 3's. Differences suggest diagonal bugs cause misfills (e.g., 7's unknown origin—perhaps bg misdetect or c=7 from nowhere), and iterations didn't propagate 4's fully to connect bottom 7's; test needs more chaining and fixed diagonals to complete shapes without artifacts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 colors act as "seeds" to propagate their color into adjacent background cells along horizontal, vertical, and specific diagonal paths until blocked by non-background cells, iterated until stabilization. The goal is to simulate these expansions correctly to match expected filled patterns, likely representing growing shapes or patterns in a nonogram-like or flood-fill variant with directional constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically identified as the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/3/4, 0 in test); propagation only fills cells exactly matching this background value, stopping at any other color (including 3, which acts as a barrier but is not propagated from).
 * Only exact 2x2 blocks of the same color c (where c != background and c != 3) trigger propagation; blocks are found iteratively on the updating grid, and the process loops until no changes occur (with a safety limit like h*w iterations to prevent infinite loops).
 * Horizontal propagation: From a block at (r, k), fill left from column k-1 and right from k+2 on both rows r and r+1, only through background cells.
 * Vertical propagation: Fill up from row r-1 and down from r+2 on both columns k and k+1, only through background.
 * Diagonal propagations are corner-specific and directional: up-right starts adjacent to the block's top-right (from r-1, k+2, moving up-right); up-left from top-left adjacent (r-1, k-1, up-left); down-right from bottom-right (r+2, k+2, down-right); down-left from bottom-left (r+2, k-1, down-left). These are single-directional rays, not full flood-fills, and only fill background.
 * Order matters: Blocks are found and processed in sorted order (by row then column), and all propagations are applied per block before re-finding blocks, which can cause cascading effects; over-propagation happens if diagonals or iterations fill unintended areas.
 * Color 3 is a special barrier: It never seeds blocks and blocks propagation, but existing 3's remain unchanged.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, ~29x30 in test); empty or single-cell grids return unchanged.
 * Subtle issue: Diagonal starts are from positions *adjacent* to the block's corners (not inside the block), and only if those starting cells are background; propagation stops immediately if the starting cell isn't background.
 * Iterations must re-scan the entire grid each time, as new blocks can form from prior propagations (e.g., a 2x2 might emerge after horizontal fill creates alignment).
 * No overwriting: Only background cells are filled; if a propagation path hits a different color or 3, it stops without filling that cell.
 * Potential overreach: In complex grids, diagonals can create unexpected fills (e.g., chaining across multiple blocks), and the lack of blocking checks mid-diagonal can spill into areas that should remain background.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

import typing as tp

```
(This is helpful and correct for dynamic background detection, used in all attempts.)

```
(These are helpful for straight-line propagations and correctly implement boundary checks and change tracking; essential for core mechanics.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it builds on implied prior ones; horizontal and vertical propagations work well where straight fills are needed (e.g., extending lines in training example 2 and 4, which passed).
 * Diagonal functions (apply_up_right, apply_up_left, apply_down_right, apply_down_left) are partially helpful but over-aggressive: They start from adjacent corner positions without checking if those starts are background or blocked, leading to incorrect fills (e.g., in training 1, they created a wide horizontal strip of 6's in row 21 columns 2-13, but expected has a narrower/more contained 6's pattern with 8's and 9/1 interrupting; in row 22, generated has 3,6,6,3 but expected shifts to include 6,8,9,1).
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated over-filled upper rows with 1's and 9's in inconsistent positions (e.g., row 0 generated [8,8,1,8,...] but expected starts with [8,8,8,8,...] and has 1's/4's shifted right; bottom rows show extra 6's spilling left/right beyond expected containment by 3's and 8's; also, row 20 generated has 8,3,3,3,3,... but expected has 8,3,3,3,3,... matching there, but row 21 diverges with extra 6's).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated propagated 2's horizontally/vertically too far (e.g., row 7 has long 2's strip to column 19, but expected limits 2's to specific positions like column 18 in row 1; also filled 7's in row 18/19 incorrectly as full strips, while expected has contained 7's in row 19 columns 5-7 and row 20 partial).
 * Training examples 2 and 4 (CORRECT) suggest the core loop and block-finding work for simpler cases without heavy diagonal interference, but the attempt fails on complex interactions.
 * The main program loop is helpful for iteration but breaks early if no blocks (good), yet in practice, it processes all diagonals per block without prioritizing, causing chains (e.g., a vertical fill might create a new block that diagonals exploit incorrectly).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs or shapes) are present or needed; the block-based approach is direct but misses that propagations might need to respect existing structures (e.g., 3's as hard stops).
 * Diagonal functions are not fully broken but unhelpful in current form due to lack of starting-cell checks (e.g., if the adjacent corner cell is already colored, no diagonal should start); suggest modifying to check new_g[starting_r][starting_c] == bg before the while loop.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 0 as background and propagates 4's diagonally in the top-left (e.g., creating a diagonal stair of 4's from row 0 col 1 to row 24 col 29-ish), and fills some 2's and 8's in mid-grid (e.g., row 7-9 has 8,2,2,8 blocks extended), but over-fills 7's in bottom-right (e.g., row 26 has long 7's from col 24-29, and row 27 spills 7's horizontally, which seems excessive without visible 2x2 seeds justifying it—mentally simulating, input has isolated 7's at bottom, no clear 2x2 for 7, so propagation shouldn't start; expected likely contains 7's more tightly around input positions like row 22 col 29).
 * Extra 8's in row 10-13 (e.g., row 11 has 8,3,3,8 extended to 8,4,4,8 but with fills around) look like vertical propagation from an 8 block, but input shows sparse 8's, so this might chain incorrectly from diagonals.
 * 3's in row 11-12 remain unchanged (correct, as barriers), but nearby 4's don't propagate through them properly (e.g., row 13 has 8,0,8,0 but output fills some 0's to 4's adjacent, which might be right if from a block, but test grid has no 2x2 4 there initially—suggests iteration created new blocks).
 * 2's in top-right (e.g., row 2 col 18-19) extend vertically/horizontally correctly to form lines, but diagonal up-left from them might incorrectly fill unrelated 0's in row 0-1.
 * Overall, output has too much filling in bottom (7's and 8's spilling into large areas), which doesn't match a mental run: Input has small 7 cluster at bottom-right without 2x2, so no propagation; top 4's and 2's should form contained diagonals/stairs without crossing the central 8/3 area. This indicates diagonals or iteration order is causing unintended cascades.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving pattern recognition and propagation, where the goal is to fill "fillable" cells (background color or a special filler like 8) based on detected 2x2 "seed" blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color, extending fills horizontally, vertically, and possibly diagonally without overwriting non-fillable cells, iterating until stable. The rules aim to complete symmetric or structured patterns (e.g., shapes, lines, or blobs) while preserving fixed elements like 3's (which seem to act as barriers) and avoiding overfilling or introducing invalid colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most common cell value; fillable cells are bg plus 8 (if present and != bg), but fills propagate a seed's color (c) into these without changing non-fillable cells (e.g., 3's block everything, other colors may not).
 * 2x2 seeds are detected only if all four cells match c (where c != 3 and c not in fillable); seeds must be sorted by position for consistent processing.
 * Fills happen in passes: horizontal (extend left/right from seed columns in seed rows ±1), vertical (extend up/down from seed rows in seed columns ±1), and diagonals (extend along lines from seed corners), but only into consecutive fillable cells; no wrapping or crossing barriers.
 * Iteration continues until no changes or max iterations (to prevent infinite loops), but must use a temp grid to avoid mid-pass overwrites affecting later seeds.
 * Subtle: 3's are absolute barriers (no fill into or through them); diagonals are tricky—up-left/down-right use one slope (rr - cc constant), up-right/down-left use the other (rr + cc constant)—but implementations often miscalculate offsets, leading to off-grid or wrong-line fills.
 * Patterns often involve symmetry (e.g., mirrored shapes, borders), and overfilling happens if diagonals or extensions ignore boundaries; 8 may be a temporary filler that gets overwritten.
 * Easy to miss: Seeds can be created dynamically during iteration (new 2x2's from prior fills trigger more), but only process existing seeds per pass; avoid filling into areas that would create invalid new seeds; some colors (e.g., 6 in ex1, 2 in ex3) should form specific blobs/lines, not flood entire regions.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes, empty grids (return as-is), and ensure output matches exact expected patterns without extra changes.
 * Considerations from attempts: Horizontal/vertical work well for straight lines but fail on curves/angles; diagonals are often broken (wrong starting points or slopes); no handling for multi-seed interactions or priority (e.g., process top-left first); max_iter = h*w prevents loops but may stop early; 8's role as fillable but overridable is key, but code sometimes treats it as permanent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color using Counter; essential for fillable set and is reliable across examples.)

```python
def get_fillable(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.Set[int]:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    counter = Counter(flat)
    fillable = {bg}
    if 8 in counter and 8 != bg:
        fillable.add(8)
    return fillable
```
(Helpful for defining what can be overwritten; captures the special role of 8 as a temporary/secondary fillable, but note: in iteration, new fills use seed c, so fillable is checked dynamically.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], fillable: tp.Set[int]) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != 3 and c not in fillable and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(Core detection of 2x2 seeds; works well for identifying propagation starters, sorts for consistency; essential but misses dynamic seeds if not re-found each iter.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, fillable: tp.Set[int], w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if 0 <= rr < len(g):
            # left
            cc = k - 1
            while cc >= 0 and g[rr][cc] in fillable:
                g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
                cc -= 1
            # right
            cc = k + 2
            while cc < w and g[rr][cc] in fillable:
                g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
                cc += 1
    return changed
```
(Helpful for row-wise extensions; correctly skips the seed itself and barriers; works in ex2/4 but needs pairing with vertical for full lines.)

```python
def apply_vertical(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, fillable: tp.Set[int], h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0 and g[rr][col] in fillable:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and g[rr][col] in fillable:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal; good for column fills, essential for vertical patterns in ex3; reliable if diagonals are fixed separately.)

(The four diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are broken or unhelpful: they use incorrect slope calculations (e.g., s = r - k for up-left often goes off-line; up-right uses r + k +1 which misaligns; down functions start at r+2 but wrong offsets like s = (r+1) - (k+1) fail to follow diagonals properly). They cause overfills or misses in ex1/ex3 (e.g., wrong positions filled with 6's or 2's); do not use in future—redesign with proper diagonal traversal (e.g., loop along rr ±1, cc ±1 matching slope).)

(The main program loop is helpful for iteration and temp grid usage to avoid race conditions, but max_iter = h*w is arbitrary and may truncate; sorting blocks ensures order but doesn't handle seed dependencies well.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training ex1 INCORRECT: Generated overfilled bottom with 6's (e.g., row20 has full 6's row, but expected has sparse 6's in columns 2-5,8; row21 has 6's in col8 but expected none); top rows have misplaced 1's/9's (e.g., row0 col16=9 but expected 8; row20 col2-5=3's correct but 6's wrong); differences suggest diagonal bugs created false extensions, and horizontal/vertical overpropagated without stopping at 3's/edges; unknown why 6's flooded instead of forming small blob.
 * Training ex2 CORRECT: All fills matched (e.g., proper line extensions from seeds); horizontal/vertical worked perfectly, no overfill.
 * Training ex3 INCORRECT: Generated filled upper areas with 2's where expected 8's (e.g., rows0-4 all 8's expected but generated has 2's leaking up? Wait, generated rows0-5 are 8's but row6 has 3's and 8's correct, but row7 has long 2's row where expected shorter 2's in cols0-6; bottom row19 has 3,7,7,3 but expected 3,7,7,3—no, row18 has 7's blob but generated row7 has extra 2's extending right; row13 has 3,3,3,4 but expected 3,3,3,8; differences: vertical fills from 2-seed in row7 overextended rightward into non-fillable? And missed filling 2's in sparse positions like row0 col18=2 expected but generated 8.
 * Training ex4 CORRECT: Matched exactly, likely simple seeds with clean h/v fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal/vertical functions are solid for straight propagations but insufficient alone (need better diagonals for angles); iteration finds new seeds but processes all at once via temp, causing order issues; find_blocks misses if seeds overlap or are created mid-iter without refind; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs) attempted, but could help validate shapes; unhelpful: diagonal functions consistently wrong, leading to 50% failure rate.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It starts with uniform 2's in top 9 rows (plausible if 2 is bg), but then introduces irregular 4's in a near-checkerboard pattern from row9 onward (e.g., row9 has 4's at cols9,11-12,14; row10 has 4's block but interrupted), escalating to dense 4's and 7's in lower rows, and unexpectedly adds 0's (e.g., row27 col22=0, row28 col21=0, row29 col20=0,22=0)—0's are likely invalid (not in input colors, suggests bug like off-grid access or uninitialized fill). This doesn't match puzzle logic: fills should propagate cleanly from 2x2 seeds (visible 3's/4's/7's suggest seeds there), forming structured shapes (e.g., borders or blobs like in training), not chaotic checkerboard or introducing new colors; overfilling with 4's/7's ignores barriers (e.g., 3's in row11-12 should block), and 0's indicate index errors in extensions; expected likely has sparse, symmetric fills (e.g., extending 4's into 2's bg without 0's or checker patterns)—test fails due to broken diagonals creating false propagations and no bounds checks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block detection and expansion, where 2x2 seeds of the same non-background, non-special (3) color trigger filling of adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until hitting obstacles or edges, simulating growth or flood-fill mechanics to complete patterns like shapes, lines, or borders. The process iterates until no more expansions occur, with background determined by the most common cell value, and special rules for handling extensions from endpoints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value (e.g., 8 in examples); all expansions only fill bg cells and stop at non-bg/non-matching-color cells, including color 3 which acts as a blocker and is excluded from seed detection.
 * Seeds are strictly 2x2 blocks of identical color c (not bg or 3); they must be detected in a loop until the grid stabilizes, processing blocks in row-column order.
 * Expansions include: full horizontal lines left/right from the 2x2 (filling bg in both rows of the block, with special downward diagonal extensions from the last filled point if blocked); vertical lines up/down from both columns; and four diagonal directions (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) filling bg along the line.
 * Subtle: Horizontal expansions have asymmetric endpoint handling—leftward stops and potentially extends down-left from the last bg filled, rightward extends down-right; vertical and diagonal are symmetric but stop immediately at any non-bg/non-c.
 * Color 3 is "solid" or immovable—never expands from it, and it blocks all fills; other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,6,7,9) can be seeds if forming 2x2 and expand into bg only.
 * Grid can have irregular widths/heights, but examples are rectangular; iterations must use deepcopy to compare changes, avoiding infinite loops.
 * Patterns often form borders, diagonals, or enclosed shapes (e.g., 6's forming a blob in train1, 2's diagonal in train3); over-filling or missing extensions leads to scattered/incorrect placements.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals use sum/difference coordinates (e.g., r+k constant for one diag, r-k for the other); horizontal extensions only affect the two rows of the seed, not full grid height; no wrapping around edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most common value; useful for all grids.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seeds excluding bg/3, sorts by position for consistent processing; essential for triggering expansions.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int):
    for col in (k, k + 1):
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0:
            if temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][col] = c
            elif temp_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][col] = c
            elif temp_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
```
(This handles vertical fills correctly from the two seed columns, skipping the seed rows themselves; helpful for line patterns.)

```python
def apply_diag_up_right(temp_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int):
    s = r + k + 1
    rr = r - 1
    while rr >= 0:
        cc = s - rr
        if cc < 0 or cc >= w:
            break
        if temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        elif temp_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        rr -= 1
```
(Example of diagonal fill using sum coordinate; similar for other diags—useful, but must ensure correct starting points beyond seed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated scattered horizontal 1's in top rows (e.g., row0: 8's with 1's at positions 2,23; row6: misplaced 4's and 1's) instead of expected vertical/diagonal stack of repeating 9-1 pairs (e.g., column9-10 has 9,1 vertically across rows); bottom 6's form incorrect partial lines (e.g., row20 has 6's from col2-5,13 but expected has structured shape with 6's in col9-10 shifting); 3's and 4's partially match but overfilled (unknown reason for 6's misalignment, possibly horizontal over-extension).
 * Train2 correct: All expansions matched expected, indicating core loop and vertical/diagonal logic works for simple cases.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated extra 2's in bottom-left (e.g., row7 col0-6 all 2's, but expected has only partial); 7's overfilled horizontally in row19 (full row0-7=7, but expected limits to col0-7); vertical 4's and 3's mostly match but 2's diagonal incomplete (e.g., missing 2's in rows0-4 col18-19); 3's in row13 col11-13 filled as 3,3,3 but expected has 3,3,3,8 (wait, generated has 3,3,3,4—mismatch at end, possibly diag overfill).
 * Train4 correct: Handled complex interactions (e.g., multiple colors, blockers) without overfill, showing horizontal+down-diag from points works in some scenarios.
 * Overall: Iteration loop stabilizes correctly (no infinite), but horizontal apply_left/right often overfills or misplaces endpoints (e.g., last_filled extensions trigger unintended down-diags); diag functions skip seed cells properly but may start from wrong offset; excluding 3 from seeds is good, but 3 blocks all directions subtly (e.g., train1 3's frame 4's/6's without expanding into them).
 * Function apply_horizontal (and sub-left/right) is broken/not fully helpful: Complex endpoint logic leads to incorrect down-left/right triggers (e.g., fills bg beyond blockers in train1/3); simplify or debug last_filled conditions.
 * apply_diag_down_left/up_right etc. are helpful but subtle coord errors (e.g., s = r + k +1 starts after seed, but may clip edges wrong in train3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows scattered 4's along a near-diagonal in top-left (rows0-10 cols0-10), 2's in irregular positions (e.g., row2 col19=2, row3 col20=2, but sparse and not forming clean lines), 3's only in rows11-12 cols5-6/10-13 (limited, possibly under-expanded), 8's as apparent secondary bg or blocker in mid-right (rows7-10 cols22-25), and 7's overfilled in bottom-right (row26 cols24-29 all 7's, row27 cols24-25/27-29=7 but irregular). Expected likely forms structured patterns like bordered shapes or diagonals (e.g., 4's completing a frame, 2's as a clean diag line, 7's contained without spillover, using 0 as bg), but generated has fragmented fills and no clear enclosure—suggests horizontal/diagonal over/under-extension, especially around 8's/3's as blockers.
 * Missing cohesive shapes: Top 4's don't connect into expected vertical/diagonal borders (e.g., row10 col5-9=8's interrupt); bottom 7's spill horizontally beyond probable 8-blockers (row25 col23-29), unlike contained 7's in train3 expected.
 * 3's underfilled: Only two small blocks, but test input has potential for more expansion around rows11-14 cols4-14; unknown if 8's are treated as bg (misidentified?) or blockers.
 * Makes sense partially for seed detection (e.g., potential 2x2 4's trigger top fills), but overall fragmented—update horizontal endpoint logic and ensure diags respect all blockers to handle test's wider grid (30 cols) and mixed 0/8/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:01:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to iteratively expand or "grow" specific 2x2 seed blocks of uniform color (excluding background and a special value 3) by filling adjacent background cells in defined directions (horizontal extensions, upward vertical, and diagonal lines up-left/up-right/down-left/down-right), simulating a flooding or pattern completion process until no more changes occur, while preserving non-background elements like 3's and other fixed colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all expansions only overwrite bg cells, never other colors or 3's (which act as barriers or fixed elements that block growth).
 * Seed blocks are strictly 2x2 squares of the same non-bg, non-3 color; they must be detected in every iteration, and expansions happen from each detected block in a loop until no changes.
 * Expansions are directional and asymmetric: horizontal fills extend left/right from the block's columns in both rows (skipping the block itself); vertical only goes upward (not downward); diagonals are line-based from the block's top-left corner, filling bg cells along the diagonal ray until hitting a non-bg or edge—up-left/up-right from above the block, down-left/down-right from below.
 * Iterations continue until no more bg cells are filled (with a safety limit to prevent infinite loops); order of processing blocks matters (sorted by row/col), and changes can create new 2x2 blocks for further growth.
 * 3's are special: they prevent block detection over them and block all fills, but may be part of expected patterns without being grown into.
 * Grids can have varying colors (e.g., 0 as bg, seeds like 4/2/6/7/8); growth uses the seed's color (c) to fill.
 * Subtle: Diagonal calculations rely on precise slope equations (e.g., up-left uses rr - s where s = r - k); fills only happen if the target is bg and in bounds; horizontal/vertical are row/col-aligned, but diagonals are strict 45-degree lines.
 * Overfilling or underfilling happens if directions miss cases (e.g., no downward vertical), or if iterations don't propagate correctly (e.g., new blocks not re-detected promptly).
 * Grids may have pre-filled non-bg areas (e.g., 8's as partial shapes) that interact with growth, and expected outputs often show completed symmetric or patterned fills (e.g., lines, blobs, or shapes like numbers/letters).
 * All attempts must handle deepcopy to avoid mutating input; max iterations prevent hangs on large grids (e.g., h*w).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode, essential for all expansions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This accurately detects and sorts 2x2 seeds, crucial for iterative growth; excludes 3 properly.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        cc = k - 1
        while cc >= 0 and g[rr][cc] == bg:
            g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
            cc -= 1
        cc = k + 2
        while cc < w and g[rr][cc] == bg:
            g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
            cc += 1
    return changed
```
(This handles left/right extensions in the two block rows correctly, skipping the block itself.)

```python
def apply_vertical_up(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0 and g[rr][col] == bg:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr -= 1
    return changed
```
(This fills upward in the two block columns; note asymmetry—no downward vertical.)

The diagonal apply functions (apply_up_left, apply_up_right, apply_down_left, apply_down_right) are mostly helpful but have bugs in slope calculations (e.g., apply_up_left uses s = r - k but iterates rr decreasing with cc = rr - s, which works for some but fails on offsets; similar issues in down functions lead to incorrect rays).

The main program loop is helpful for iteration but over-applies in one pass per block without re-scanning mid-iteration, causing incomplete propagation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) succeeded on training examples 2 and 4 (exact match to expected, indicating correct handling of some seed expansions and iterations) but failed on 1 and 3.
 * Train 1: Generated overfilled bottom area with 6's in irregular shapes (e.g., row 20 has [8, 3, 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,...] vs expected [8, 3,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,9,1,...] with cleaner lines and 8's interrupting; row 21 has 3-8 transition wrong; row 22 has extra 6's; row 23 has missing 6's and wrong positions—likely due to diagonal miscalculations creating new unintended blocks or overextending horizontals).
 * Train 3: Generated mismatched fills, e.g., row 13 has [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,...] (extra 4's and missing 8); row 18 has 3's but expected cleaner; bottom rows have 7's filled downward incorrectly (e.g., row 19 has 7's extending right vs expected limited; unknown why vertical-up only didn't propagate 2's/4's properly to match expected positions like row 0 col 18=2).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_blocks serves similar purpose for seeds.
 * Diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful: e.g., apply_down_right's s = (r + 1) - (k + 1) and cc = rr - s often misaligns rays, leading to skipped or wrong fills (seen in train 1's 6-blob errors); don't rely on them without fixing slopes.
 * Horizontal and vertical_up are helpful and correct, as evidenced by partial matches in trains 1/3 (e.g., some lines filled right).
 * Iteration loop is essential but insufficient: processes all blocks per iter without immediate re-detection, missing chained growth (e.g., new 2x2 from partial fills not triggering until next iter, causing underfill in test/large grids).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond buggy diagonals; get_background and deepcopy are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it underfills massively, leaving most of the grid as 0's (bg) despite clear 2x2-ish seeds of 4's along the diagonal (rows 0-9, cols 0-9) and scattered 2's/3's/8's that should trigger growth; e.g., top-left 4's barely expand (only minor 8's in bottom-right row 25-27, and partial 7's in row 26), but expected should show full diagonal lines or blobs of 4's extending horizontally/up/diagonally, plus 2's growing into shapes, and 8's/7's completing patterns without overwriting 3's.
 * Differences: Row 0 has [4,0,0,...2,0,...4,0,...] with no fills vs expected likely full horizontal/diagonal 4-lines from seeds; row 10 has partial 8's/4's but no propagation to fill surrounding 0's upward/downward; bottom has isolated 7's/8's (e.g., row 26 [0,0,...8,7,7,7,7,7,7]) that seem overextended downward without matching any seed, suggesting diagonal bugs created phantom growth; overall, output looks sparse/incomplete (e.g., no 4-blob in center, 2's not expanded), failing to "complete" the visual puzzle into coherent shapes—likely due to iteration not converging fully or missed directions for this larger/varied grid.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 02:01:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or flood-filling, where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 cells trigger propagation of that color along straight lines (horizontal, vertical) and possibly diagonals, filling adjacent background cells until blocked by other colors or 3s, with the goal of transforming the input grid to match an expected filled pattern. The background color is dynamically determined (e.g., most common cell value), and 3 appears to act as a special blocker or non-fillable element.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent cell value in the grid, but this may not always align with the expected output's dominant color (e.g., in Training 1, generated uses 9 as bg but expected uses 8, leading to over-filling with 9s instead of 8s).
 * 2x2 blocks are detected only if all four cells match a color c != bg and c != 3; blocks are sorted by row then column for processing order, which may affect iteration stability.
 * Propagation occurs from detected 2x2 blocks in multiple directions: horizontal (left/right from the block's rows, skipping over c or 3 but stopping at other colors), vertical (up/down from the block's columns), and four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) starting from each corner of the block, again filling only bg cells and stopping at non-c/non-3/non-bg.
 * The process iterates up to h*w times or until no blocks or changes occur, using a deepcopy to avoid mutating the original; however, applying propagations to all blocks in a single pass per iteration can cause over-filling or interference between blocks.
 * 3 cells are never filled or used as seeds but block propagation; other colors (e.g., 1,4,6,7,8,9) can be seeds or blockers depending on context.
 * Subtle element: Propagation does not fill within the 2x2 block itself (already filled) and starts strictly outside (e.g., horizontal from k-1 left and k+2 right); diagonals are one-directional from each corner and may not connect properly across the grid.
 * Grids can be irregular in shape/content (e.g., sparse with many 0s in test), and propagation must respect bounds without wrapping.
 * Order of processing blocks and directions matters; current top-to-bottom, left-to-right may miss dependencies where later blocks rely on earlier fills.
 * Easy to miss: Not all lines need full-grid spanning; partial fills stop at blockers, and multiple overlapping propagations from different blocks/colors must resolve without overwriting (current code allows it, leading to inconsistencies).
 * 0 may represent a special bg variant or empty, but treated as fillable like other bg; in test, excessive 0s remain unfilled or wrongly filled.
 * Iterations may loop inefficiently if new blocks form mid-process; current code re-finds blocks each iteration but applies to all at once.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as bg, useful for initialization, though it may need adjustment if bg isn't strictly most common.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by row then col
```
(This is helpful for detecting seed 2x2 blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent order.)

The apply_* functions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for directional filling logic, as they correctly skip over c/3 and stop at other colors while filling bg, but they are broken for multi-block interactions (e.g., they apply unconditionally per block without checking post-fill state, leading to overwrites).

No types like PuzzleElement are present, but tp.List[tp.List[int]] is a good type hint for grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects 2x2 blocks and attempts line-based propagation but fails overall due to incorrect bg choice or over-aggressive filling.
 * Training 1: Generated over-fills top rows with 9s (assuming 9 as bg) and scatters 1s/4s/6s/3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 has all 9s except ends with 1/8, but expected has mostly 8s with patterned 9/1/4/3/6); bottom sections have mismatched 6/3/8 placements (e.g., generated row 20 has 6,3,6,6,9,... but expected has 8,3,6,6,6,...); unknown why 8s appear sporadically instead of dominating as in expected.
 * Training 2: Generated fills almost entirely with 4s and leaves 3s isolated (e.g., row 2: [4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4] vs expected [8,3,3,4,3,8,8,8]), failing to propagate 8s as bg and expand shapes like the 3-triangle; bottom rows all 4s but expected has 4s only in specific positions with 8s elsewhere.
 * Training 3: Generated leaves large top areas as 2s (bg?) and poorly expands 3/4/7 patterns (e.g., row 5: [2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,...] with 8s filling bg areas); lower sections have fragmented 4/7/3 (e.g., row 11: [2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,2,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]), missing full 8-fills and shape completions.
 * Training 4: Generated mostly 6s with isolated 3s (e.g., row 2: [6,3,6,3,6,6,...] vs expected [8,3,6,3,6,8,...]), failing to introduce 8s as bg and expand the 3-pattern downward/rightward properly; bottom rows all 6s but expected has all 8s.
 * All trainings show under-filling of bg (e.g., 8s in expected) and incorrect color dominance; propagation seems to activate but doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., doesn't create the connected 8-regions or precise 3/4/6 blobs).
 * Function `program` is helpful as a main loop but broken in iteration logic (applies all propagations before re-checking blocks, causing chain reactions that overwrite expected patterns).
 * Diagonal functions are unhelpful or broken: they start from corners but don't connect lines properly (e.g., in Training 1, diagonals may cause stray 4s/1s not seen in expected straight-line fills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) is present, but it would be essential for identifying complete patterns beyond just 2x2 seeds; current code lacks blob detection or connectivity checks.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and directional fills but misses bg correctness, propagation stopping rules, and handling of multi-color interactions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves excessive 0s unfilled (e.g., most of the grid is still 0s, with sparse 4s along a diagonal-ish pattern in top-left, 2s scattered, and small 8/3/7 clusters in bottom-right), suggesting minimal propagation occurred—likely because bg=0 (most common) and few/no valid 2x2 blocks were detected or propagation stopped immediately due to blockers/3s.
 * It fails to create cohesive filled regions (e.g., the 8s in rows 6-7 and 25-28 are tiny and isolated, not expanding to cover bg areas as expected in trainings; 7s in bottom appear fragmented vs. potential full lines).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from trainings): Expected likely has a dominant bg (e.g., 0 or 8) filling large areas, with 2/4/3/7/8 propagating into shapes like lines or blobs from seeds, but generated has no such expansion—e.g., top rows have isolated 4s/2s but no horizontal/vertical fills connecting them, and bottom 7s don't form the connected patterns seen in training expectations.
 * Unknown why so many 0s persist (perhaps no 2x2 seeds at all, or propagation skips over 0s incorrectly); it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as it looks like a barely modified input rather than a completed pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based "growth" or "flood fill" mechanics where certain seed patterns (like 2x2 blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color) trigger expansion of colored regions into adjacent background cells along specific directions (horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal lines), ultimately filling predefined shapes or blobs while preserving existing structures and avoiding over-expansion or incorrect merging. The goal is to simulate iterative expansion until no more valid triggers exist, resulting in a final grid that matches expected filled patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value (e.g., 8 or 0), and expansions only overwrite background cells—never existing colors, 3's (which seem to act as barriers or fixed non-fillable elements), or other blocks.
 * Expansion triggers on 2x2 blocks of the same color c (excluding 3 and background), but only if they form a "corner" or seed for line-based growth; the program iterates until no new blocks are found, but must avoid infinite loops (capped at h*w iterations).
 * Directions for expansion include left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's edges, up/down vertical lines from its sides, and potentially diagonal lines (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) starting from the block's corners, but only filling consecutive background cells in straight lines without skipping or branching.
 * Subtlety: Expansions happen simultaneously across all detected blocks in each iteration (using a temp grid to avoid partial updates affecting others), and the process repeats until stabilization; however, diagonals must align precisely with the block's position (e.g., using sum/difference of row+col for anti/main diagonals) and stop at boundaries or non-background.
 * 3's are special: They block all expansions and are never overwritten or used as seeds, suggesting they are walls or outlines for shapes.
 * Patterns in expected outputs show "blobs" or shapes (e.g., letters/numbers formed by filling with a color like 6 into a 3-outlined area) and linear extensions (e.g., diagonals of 9-1 or horizontal 4's extending to edges).
 * Easy to miss: Not all directions always apply (e.g., some examples need vertical fill to top/bottom edges, others diagonal to connect shapes); over-filling occurs if diagonals are miscalculated (e.g., wrong starting sum s for diagonal lines); blocks must be sorted by position to process in order, but simultaneous application prevents order-dependence.
 * Iterations must propagate: A single 2x2 can create new 2x2's in subsequent iterations, leading to chain reactions (e.g., filling a long horizontal line that then seeds verticals).
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x8 in ex1, 8x8 in ex2), and empty rows/columns of background should remain unfilled unless triggered.
 * No merging of different colors; each block expands its own c independently.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background color, essential for all expansions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately, excluding 3's and background; sorting ensures consistent processing order.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
            cc = k - 1
            while 0 <= cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc -= 1
            cc = k + 2
            while cc < w and temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc += 1
```
(This correctly fills left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's bottom/top edges into background.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> None:
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        rr = r - 1
        while 0 <= rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr -= 1
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr += 1
```
(This correctly fills up/down vertical lines from the 2x2's left/right sides into background.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = r + k + 1
    rr = r - 1
    while 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
        cc = s - rr
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr -= 1

def apply_diagonal_down_left(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:

    while rr < h:
        cc = s - rr
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1

def apply_diagonal_up_left(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = r - k
    rr = r - 1
    while 0 <= rr < len(temp_g):
        cc = rr - s
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr -= 1

def apply_diagonal_down_right(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    s = (r + 1) - (k + 1)
    rr = r + 2
    while rr < h:
        cc = rr - s
        if not (0 <= cc < w) or temp_g[rr][cc] != bg:
            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1
```
(These are broken: Incorrect starting sums (s) lead to wrong diagonal alignments; e.g., up-right uses s = r + k + 1, which offsets incorrectly and causes over/under-filling or misalignment with block corners. They partially fill in some cases but fail to match expected linear diagonals, like the 9-1 patterns in ex1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 or 0) and detects 2x2 blocks, successfully triggering some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., in ex2, it fills some 4's horizontally but misses vertical extension to row 0; in ex4, it fills some 6's but misses top-row extension).
 * Horizontal and vertical applies work well for straight-line extensions (e.g., in ex1 bottom, partial 6-filling into the 3-outlined shape; in ex3, some 2/4/7 fills occur but don't propagate fully).
 * What didn't work: Diagonal functions are fundamentally flawed, causing incorrect or missing fills (e.g., in ex1, top diagonal 9-1 pattern is scattered/misplaced instead of clean vertical repetition; bottom 6's don't fully fill the shape due to poor diagonal chaining; in ex3, 2's and 7's don't extend to expected positions like row 0 col 6 or the 3-7 shape).
 * Iteration logic is mostly sound (uses temp_g for simultaneous updates, breaks on no change), but max_iter cap prevents infinite loops while allowing propagation; however, it over-applies in some spots (e.g., ex1 row 7 col 18 has extra 4 where expected has 8).
 * In ex1, generated has scattered 1's/9's in top rows (e.g., row 0: 8's with 1 at col2 and 9 at col15) vs. expected clean diagonal-like repetition of [9,1] blocks extending vertically; bottom 6's fill partially but leave gaps (e.g., row 20 col2=6 but expected has more structured 6's aligned with 3's).
 * In ex2, generated misses vertical 4-fill to row0 col3 (stays 8, expected=4) and doesn't fill row6 col0=4; partial horizontal 4's in row4 are correct but incomplete.
 * In ex3, generated leaves many areas unfilled (e.g., no 2's in top rows like expected row0 col18=2; 7's in bottom don't match exact shape; 4's in col13 are partial); 3's block correctly but expansions stop prematurely.
 * In ex4, generated misses vertical 6-fill to row0 col2/5 (stays 8, expected=6 at row6 col0 but wait, expected has 6 only at row6 col0? No, ex4 expected has 6 at row6 col0 but generated doesn't; actually ex4 generated matches most but misses row0 extensions).
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and line-fills but fails on diagonals and full propagation, leading to incomplete shapes (e.g., unfilled tops/bottoms in ex2/ex4); no extraction of "objects" or blobs attempted, which might help identify target shapes bounded by 3's.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; with 0 as background, it shows partial scattered fills (e.g., diagonal-ish 4's in top-left, some 2's along a near-diagonal in cols 17-29, 8's forming a small block in rows 7-10 cols 22-25, 3's/4's in rows 11-14 cols 4-13, and 7's filling a shape in bottom rows 24-28 cols 24-29 bounded by 8's), but it appears under-filled and misaligned compared to expected mechanics.
 * Issues: Top 4's don't extend fully horizontally/vertically (e.g., row0 col1=4 but no left/right fill into 0's); 2's are placed but don't chain into longer lines or fill shapes (e.g., row2 col28=2 isolated); 8-block in mid doesn't expand; bottom 7's fill some but leave gaps (e.g., row26 col25=7 but expected likely full horizontal/vertical into 0's); no clear propagation from 2x2 seeds to match shape outlines (e.g., potential 3-barriers around 7's not fully utilized); overall, it resembles the training errors with partial but incorrect expansions, suggesting diagonal bugs prevent proper test filling (e.g., the 2's look like attempted diagonal but offset wrong, and 7's don't reach edges like in ex2/4 expectations).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if (c != bg and
                g[r][k + 1] == c and
                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" connected regions starting from detected 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, filling adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until blocked by a different color, effectively completing patterns or shapes in a visual puzzle like a partial nonogram or blob expansion. The process iterates until no more changes occur, with background identified as the most common cell value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/4, likely 0 in test).
 * Expansion only triggers from 2x2 blocks of identical non-bg color; skips if block color is 3 (special case, perhaps a "fixed" or non-expandable color).
 * Fills must stop at boundaries: horizontal/vertical expand along rows/columns until hitting non-bg/non-matching color or edge; diagonals follow specific slopes (up-left: rr - (r - k), up-right: s - rr where s = r + (k+1), etc.) and stop similarly.
 * Iterations are bounded (h*w times) to prevent infinite loops, and blocks are sorted by (row, col) for consistent processing order.
 * Subtlety: Expansions can chain (one fill creates new 2x2 blocks for further fills), but the code processes all blocks in one pass before re-scanning, which may miss some chaining if not iterated fully.
 * Diagonal fills are asymmetric and direction-specific: up-left/down-right follow one diagonal slope, up-right/down-left follow the other; they only fill bg cells in the line, not branching.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal/vertical apply to both rows/columns of the 2x2 block simultaneously; diagonals start from the block's position but extend outward only (not inward, as the block is already filled).
 * Color 3 blocks are skipped entirely, preventing over-expansion of certain elements (seen in training 1 where 3's form fixed shapes).
 * Grids may have irregular patterns (e.g., scattered seeds like 2's in test), requiring multiple iterations to propagate fills correctly without overwriting existing non-bg cells.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills only if cell is bg or matches c, but breaks if non-matching non-bg, which is correct but can lead to incomplete fills if blocks overlap incorrectly.
 * No rotation or symmetry assumption; process top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode, essential for all fills; works in all examples.)

            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects seed 2x2 blocks accurately; core to triggering expansions; reliable across examples.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # left
        cc = k - 1
        while cc >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
                break
            cc -= 1
        # right
        cc = k + 2
        while cc < w:
            if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
                break
            cc += 1
    return changed
```
(Handles row-wise expansion for the two rows of the block; works well for straight lines but note it skips the block itself (k to k+1).)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], k: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
                new_g[rr][col] = c
                changed = True
            elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal but column-wise; effective for vertical propagation.)

(The diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are helpful for slope-based fills but have bugs in slope calculations, leading to off-diagonal paths in some cases; retain but fix indexing.)

(The main program loop with deepcopy, sorting blocks by (r,k), and iteration until no change is helpful for convergence, but max_iter = h*w may be too low for complex chaining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 2 and 4, expanding fills properly for 1's, 9's, 3's, 4's, 6's, and 7's in those cases without overfilling.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated misplaced 1's and 9's in the top half (e.g., row 0 has 1 at col 2 instead of expected empty 8's; bottom rows 20-23 have incorrect 6's positions, like row 20 col 2-6 as 6's but expected has 6's only in specific tapered shape starting row 21), and row 7 col 18 as 4 instead of expected 8; also duplicated 3's blocks without proper diagonal extension, leading to asymmetric fills (unknown why 6's appeared—possibly erroneous bg fill with wrong c).
 * Failed training example 3: Bottom half overfilled 7's into row 19 (full row of 7's but expected has partial 7's only in row 19 cols 5-7 and row 20 partial); top half failed to fill 2's correctly (e.g., row 2 col 18 as 8 instead of 2, row 6 col 13 as 2 but expected 8); 3's in row 13 col 14 as 4 instead of 3, suggesting diagonal functions misaligned or skipped valid blocks.
 * Successful cases (2 and 4) show horizontal/vertical fills work reliably for straight patterns, but diagonals may underperform in asymmetric grids.
 * Skipping c==3 blocks is helpful (prevents fixed shapes from expanding, correct in ex1/3), but may need generalization for other "seed" colors.
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; find_blocks is partial but useful—consider adding a full connected-component finder for post-fill validation.
 * Diagonal functions are broken in slope math (e.g., up-right uses s = r + (k+1), but for block at (r,k)-(r+1,k+1), it may not align with the anti-diagonal; leads to off-path fills in ex1/3); not fully helpful until fixed.
 * Overall, iteration loop converges correctly when directions align, but chaining fails in dense grids (ex1/3), and no handling for overlapping expansions causing color conflicts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (bg=0 correctly identified; 4's expanded along the main diagonal from rows 0-24 cols 0-24, filling bg to form a thick band; 2's filled horizontally/vertically in scattered positions like row 2 cols 18-19, row 6 col 21-25, and some diagonals; 8's filled a small block in rows 6-9 cols 22-25 and rows 24-27 cols 23-25; 3's in rows 11-12 cols 5-6 unchanged as expected since skipped).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Introduced erroneous 7's in bottom-right (rows 25-28 cols 24-29, forming a partial block, but input has no 7 seeds—possibly spillover from unhandled 2 or 8 expansion); overfilled 2's in row 22 col 29 as 7? (input has 7 there? Wait, input row 22 col 29=7, but generated has 7's spreading incorrectly); diagonal fills for 2's in row 2 col 28 as 2 (but input has 2 there, expected no spread); incomplete 8's in row 10 (only partial, missing vertical down to match input seeds); and row 13 col 4 as 8 but input has 8, yet no further diagonal to connect 3's. Differences suggest diagonal bugs cause misfills (e.g., 7's unknown origin—perhaps bg misdetect or c=7 from nowhere), and iterations didn't propagate 4's fully to connect bottom 7's; test needs more chaining and fixed diagonals to complete shapes without artifacts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 colors act as "seeds" to propagate their color into adjacent background cells along horizontal, vertical, and specific diagonal paths until blocked by non-background cells, iterated until stabilization. The goal is to simulate these expansions correctly to match expected filled patterns, likely representing growing shapes or patterns in a nonogram-like or flood-fill variant with directional constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically identified as the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/3/4, 0 in test); propagation only fills cells exactly matching this background value, stopping at any other color (including 3, which acts as a barrier but is not propagated from).
 * Only exact 2x2 blocks of the same color c (where c != background and c != 3) trigger propagation; blocks are found iteratively on the updating grid, and the process loops until no changes occur (with a safety limit like h*w iterations to prevent infinite loops).
 * Horizontal propagation: From a block at (r, k), fill left from column k-1 and right from k+2 on both rows r and r+1, only through background cells.
 * Vertical propagation: Fill up from row r-1 and down from r+2 on both columns k and k+1, only through background.
 * Diagonal propagations are corner-specific and directional: up-right starts adjacent to the block's top-right (from r-1, k+2, moving up-right); up-left from top-left adjacent (r-1, k-1, up-left); down-right from bottom-right (r+2, k+2, down-right); down-left from bottom-left (r+2, k-1, down-left). These are single-directional rays, not full flood-fills, and only fill background.
 * Order matters: Blocks are found and processed in sorted order (by row then column), and all propagations are applied per block before re-finding blocks, which can cause cascading effects; over-propagation happens if diagonals or iterations fill unintended areas.
 * Color 3 is a special barrier: It never seeds blocks and blocks propagation, but existing 3's remain unchanged.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, ~29x30 in test); empty or single-cell grids return unchanged.
 * Subtle issue: Diagonal starts are from positions *adjacent* to the block's corners (not inside the block), and only if those starting cells are background; propagation stops immediately if the starting cell isn't background.
 * Iterations must re-scan the entire grid each time, as new blocks can form from prior propagations (e.g., a 2x2 might emerge after horizontal fill creates alignment).
 * No overwriting: Only background cells are filled; if a propagation path hits a different color or 3, it stops without filling that cell.
 * Potential overreach: In complex grids, diagonals can create unexpected fills (e.g., chaining across multiple blocks), and the lack of blocking checks mid-diagonal can spill into areas that should remain background.

(These are helpful for straight-line propagations and correctly implement boundary checks and change tracking; essential for core mechanics.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it builds on implied prior ones; horizontal and vertical propagations work well where straight fills are needed (e.g., extending lines in training example 2 and 4, which passed).
 * Diagonal functions (apply_up_right, apply_up_left, apply_down_right, apply_down_left) are partially helpful but over-aggressive: They start from adjacent corner positions without checking if those starts are background or blocked, leading to incorrect fills (e.g., in training 1, they created a wide horizontal strip of 6's in row 21 columns 2-13, but expected has a narrower/more contained 6's pattern with 8's and 9/1 interrupting; in row 22, generated has 3,6,6,3 but expected shifts to include 6,8,9,1).
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated over-filled upper rows with 1's and 9's in inconsistent positions (e.g., row 0 generated [8,8,1,8,...] but expected starts with [8,8,8,8,...] and has 1's/4's shifted right; bottom rows show extra 6's spilling left/right beyond expected containment by 3's and 8's; also, row 20 generated has 8,3,3,3,3,... but expected has 8,3,3,3,3,... matching there, but row 21 diverges with extra 6's).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated propagated 2's horizontally/vertically too far (e.g., row 7 has long 2's strip to column 19, but expected limits 2's to specific positions like column 18 in row 1; also filled 7's in row 18/19 incorrectly as full strips, while expected has contained 7's in row 19 columns 5-7 and row 20 partial).
 * Training examples 2 and 4 (CORRECT) suggest the core loop and block-finding work for simpler cases without heavy diagonal interference, but the attempt fails on complex interactions.
 * The main program loop is helpful for iteration but breaks early if no blocks (good), yet in practice, it processes all diagonals per block without prioritizing, causing chains (e.g., a vertical fill might create a new block that diagonals exploit incorrectly).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs or shapes) are present or needed; the block-based approach is direct but misses that propagations might need to respect existing structures (e.g., 3's as hard stops).
 * Diagonal functions are not fully broken but unhelpful in current form due to lack of starting-cell checks (e.g., if the adjacent corner cell is already colored, no diagonal should start); suggest modifying to check new_g[starting_r][starting_c] == bg before the while loop.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 0 as background and propagates 4's diagonally in the top-left (e.g., creating a diagonal stair of 4's from row 0 col 1 to row 24 col 29-ish), and fills some 2's and 8's in mid-grid (e.g., row 7-9 has 8,2,2,8 blocks extended), but over-fills 7's in bottom-right (e.g., row 26 has long 7's from col 24-29, and row 27 spills 7's horizontally, which seems excessive without visible 2x2 seeds justifying it—mentally simulating, input has isolated 7's at bottom, no clear 2x2 for 7, so propagation shouldn't start; expected likely contains 7's more tightly around input positions like row 22 col 29).
 * Extra 8's in row 10-13 (e.g., row 11 has 8,3,3,8 extended to 8,4,4,8 but with fills around) look like vertical propagation from an 8 block, but input shows sparse 8's, so this might chain incorrectly from diagonals.
 * 3's in row 11-12 remain unchanged (correct, as barriers), but nearby 4's don't propagate through them properly (e.g., row 13 has 8,0,8,0 but output fills some 0's to 4's adjacent, which might be right if from a block, but test grid has no 2x2 4 there initially—suggests iteration created new blocks).
 * 2's in top-right (e.g., row 2 col 18-19) extend vertically/horizontally correctly to form lines, but diagonal up-left from them might incorrectly fill unrelated 0's in row 0-1.
 * Overall, output has too much filling in bottom (7's and 8's spilling into large areas), which doesn't match a mental run: Input has small 7 cluster at bottom-right without 2x2, so no propagation; top 4's and 2's should form contained diagonals/stairs without crossing the central 8/3 area. This indicates diagonals or iteration order is causing unintended cascades.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving pattern recognition and propagation, where the goal is to fill "fillable" cells (background color or a special filler like 8) based on detected 2x2 "seed" blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color, extending fills horizontally, vertically, and possibly diagonally without overwriting non-fillable cells, iterating until stable. The rules aim to complete symmetric or structured patterns (e.g., shapes, lines, or blobs) while preserving fixed elements like 3's (which seem to act as barriers) and avoiding overfilling or introducing invalid colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most common cell value; fillable cells are bg plus 8 (if present and != bg), but fills propagate a seed's color (c) into these without changing non-fillable cells (e.g., 3's block everything, other colors may not).
 * 2x2 seeds are detected only if all four cells match c (where c != 3 and c not in fillable); seeds must be sorted by position for consistent processing.
 * Fills happen in passes: horizontal (extend left/right from seed columns in seed rows ±1), vertical (extend up/down from seed rows in seed columns ±1), and diagonals (extend along lines from seed corners), but only into consecutive fillable cells; no wrapping or crossing barriers.
 * Iteration continues until no changes or max iterations (to prevent infinite loops), but must use a temp grid to avoid mid-pass overwrites affecting later seeds.
 * Subtle: 3's are absolute barriers (no fill into or through them); diagonals are tricky—up-left/down-right use one slope (rr - cc constant), up-right/down-left use the other (rr + cc constant)—but implementations often miscalculate offsets, leading to off-grid or wrong-line fills.
 * Patterns often involve symmetry (e.g., mirrored shapes, borders), and overfilling happens if diagonals or extensions ignore boundaries; 8 may be a temporary filler that gets overwritten.
 * Easy to miss: Seeds can be created dynamically during iteration (new 2x2's from prior fills trigger more), but only process existing seeds per pass; avoid filling into areas that would create invalid new seeds; some colors (e.g., 6 in ex1, 2 in ex3) should form specific blobs/lines, not flood entire regions.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes, empty grids (return as-is), and ensure output matches exact expected patterns without extra changes.
 * Considerations from attempts: Horizontal/vertical work well for straight lines but fail on curves/angles; diagonals are often broken (wrong starting points or slopes); no handling for multi-seed interactions or priority (e.g., process top-left first); max_iter = h*w prevents loops but may stop early; 8's role as fillable but overridable is key, but code sometimes treats it as permanent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color using Counter; essential for fillable set and is reliable across examples.)

```python
def get_fillable(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.Set[int]:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    counter = Counter(flat)
    fillable = {bg}
    if 8 in counter and 8 != bg:
        fillable.add(8)
    return fillable
```
(Helpful for defining what can be overwritten; captures the special role of 8 as a temporary/secondary fillable, but note: in iteration, new fills use seed c, so fillable is checked dynamically.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], fillable: tp.Set[int]) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != 3 and c not in fillable and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(Core detection of 2x2 seeds; works well for identifying propagation starters, sorts for consistency; essential but misses dynamic seeds if not re-found each iter.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, fillable: tp.Set[int], w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if 0 <= rr < len(g):
            # left
            cc = k - 1
            while cc >= 0 and g[rr][cc] in fillable:
                g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
                cc -= 1
            # right
            cc = k + 2
            while cc < w and g[rr][cc] in fillable:
                g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
                cc += 1
    return changed
```
(Helpful for row-wise extensions; correctly skips the seed itself and barriers; works in ex2/4 but needs pairing with vertical for full lines.)

```python
def apply_vertical(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, fillable: tp.Set[int], h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0 and g[rr][col] in fillable:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and g[rr][col] in fillable:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal; good for column fills, essential for vertical patterns in ex3; reliable if diagonals are fixed separately.)

(The four diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are broken or unhelpful: they use incorrect slope calculations (e.g., s = r - k for up-left often goes off-line; up-right uses r + k +1 which misaligns; down functions start at r+2 but wrong offsets like s = (r+1) - (k+1) fail to follow diagonals properly). They cause overfills or misses in ex1/ex3 (e.g., wrong positions filled with 6's or 2's); do not use in future—redesign with proper diagonal traversal (e.g., loop along rr ±1, cc ±1 matching slope).)

(The main program loop is helpful for iteration and temp grid usage to avoid race conditions, but max_iter = h*w is arbitrary and may truncate; sorting blocks ensures order but doesn't handle seed dependencies well.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training ex1 INCORRECT: Generated overfilled bottom with 6's (e.g., row20 has full 6's row, but expected has sparse 6's in columns 2-5,8; row21 has 6's in col8 but expected none); top rows have misplaced 1's/9's (e.g., row0 col16=9 but expected 8; row20 col2-5=3's correct but 6's wrong); differences suggest diagonal bugs created false extensions, and horizontal/vertical overpropagated without stopping at 3's/edges; unknown why 6's flooded instead of forming small blob.
 * Training ex2 CORRECT: All fills matched (e.g., proper line extensions from seeds); horizontal/vertical worked perfectly, no overfill.
 * Training ex3 INCORRECT: Generated filled upper areas with 2's where expected 8's (e.g., rows0-4 all 8's expected but generated has 2's leaking up? Wait, generated rows0-5 are 8's but row6 has 3's and 8's correct, but row7 has long 2's row where expected shorter 2's in cols0-6; bottom row19 has 3,7,7,3 but expected 3,7,7,3—no, row18 has 7's blob but generated row7 has extra 2's extending right; row13 has 3,3,3,4 but expected 3,3,3,8; differences: vertical fills from 2-seed in row7 overextended rightward into non-fillable? And missed filling 2's in sparse positions like row0 col18=2 expected but generated 8.
 * Training ex4 CORRECT: Matched exactly, likely simple seeds with clean h/v fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal/vertical functions are solid for straight propagations but insufficient alone (need better diagonals for angles); iteration finds new seeds but processes all at once via temp, causing order issues; find_blocks misses if seeds overlap or are created mid-iter without refind; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs) attempted, but could help validate shapes; unhelpful: diagonal functions consistently wrong, leading to 50% failure rate.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It starts with uniform 2's in top 9 rows (plausible if 2 is bg), but then introduces irregular 4's in a near-checkerboard pattern from row9 onward (e.g., row9 has 4's at cols9,11-12,14; row10 has 4's block but interrupted), escalating to dense 4's and 7's in lower rows, and unexpectedly adds 0's (e.g., row27 col22=0, row28 col21=0, row29 col20=0,22=0)—0's are likely invalid (not in input colors, suggests bug like off-grid access or uninitialized fill). This doesn't match puzzle logic: fills should propagate cleanly from 2x2 seeds (visible 3's/4's/7's suggest seeds there), forming structured shapes (e.g., borders or blobs like in training), not chaotic checkerboard or introducing new colors; overfilling with 4's/7's ignores barriers (e.g., 3's in row11-12 should block), and 0's indicate index errors in extensions; expected likely has sparse, symmetric fills (e.g., extending 4's into 2's bg without 0's or checker patterns)—test fails due to broken diagonals creating false propagations and no bounds checks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to iteratively expand or "grow" specific 2x2 seed blocks of uniform color (excluding background and a special value 3) by filling adjacent background cells in defined directions (horizontal extensions, upward vertical, and diagonal lines up-left/up-right/down-left/down-right), simulating a flooding or pattern completion process until no more changes occur, while preserving non-background elements like 3's and other fixed colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all expansions only overwrite bg cells, never other colors or 3's (which act as barriers or fixed elements that block growth).
 * Seed blocks are strictly 2x2 squares of the same non-bg, non-3 color; they must be detected in every iteration, and expansions happen from each detected block in a loop until no changes.
 * Expansions are directional and asymmetric: horizontal fills extend left/right from the block's columns in both rows (skipping the block itself); vertical only goes upward (not downward); diagonals are line-based from the block's top-left corner, filling bg cells along the diagonal ray until hitting a non-bg or edge—up-left/up-right from above the block, down-left/down-right from below.
 * Iterations continue until no more bg cells are filled (with a safety limit to prevent infinite loops); order of processing blocks matters (sorted by row/col), and changes can create new 2x2 blocks for further growth.
 * 3's are special: they prevent block detection over them and block all fills, but may be part of expected patterns without being grown into.
 * Grids can have varying colors (e.g., 0 as bg, seeds like 4/2/6/7/8); growth uses the seed's color (c) to fill.
 * Subtle: Diagonal calculations rely on precise slope equations (e.g., up-left uses rr - s where s = r - k); fills only happen if the target is bg and in bounds; horizontal/vertical are row/col-aligned, but diagonals are strict 45-degree lines.
 * Overfilling or underfilling happens if directions miss cases (e.g., no downward vertical), or if iterations don't propagate correctly (e.g., new blocks not re-detected promptly).
 * Grids may have pre-filled non-bg areas (e.g., 8's as partial shapes) that interact with growth, and expected outputs often show completed symmetric or patterned fills (e.g., lines, blobs, or shapes like numbers/letters).
 * All attempts must handle deepcopy to avoid mutating input; max iterations prevent hangs on large grids (e.g., h*w).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode, essential for all expansions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This accurately detects and sorts 2x2 seeds, crucial for iterative growth; excludes 3 properly.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        cc = k - 1
        while cc >= 0 and g[rr][cc] == bg:
            g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
            cc -= 1
        cc = k + 2
        while cc < w and g[rr][cc] == bg:
            g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
            cc += 1
    return changed
```
(This handles left/right extensions in the two block rows correctly, skipping the block itself.)

```python
def apply_vertical_up(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0 and g[rr][col] == bg:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr -= 1
    return changed
```
(This fills upward in the two block columns; note asymmetry—no downward vertical.)

The diagonal apply functions (apply_up_left, apply_up_right, apply_down_left, apply_down_right) are mostly helpful but have bugs in slope calculations (e.g., apply_up_left uses s = r - k but iterates rr decreasing with cc = rr - s, which works for some but fails on offsets; similar issues in down functions lead to incorrect rays).

The main program loop is helpful for iteration but over-applies in one pass per block without re-scanning mid-iteration, causing incomplete propagation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) succeeded on training examples 2 and 4 (exact match to expected, indicating correct handling of some seed expansions and iterations) but failed on 1 and 3.
 * Train 1: Generated overfilled bottom area with 6's in irregular shapes (e.g., row 20 has [8, 3, 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,...] vs expected [8, 3,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,9,1,...] with cleaner lines and 8's interrupting; row 21 has 3-8 transition wrong; row 22 has extra 6's; row 23 has missing 6's and wrong positions—likely due to diagonal miscalculations creating new unintended blocks or overextending horizontals).
 * Train 3: Generated mismatched fills, e.g., row 13 has [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,...] (extra 4's and missing 8); row 18 has 3's but expected cleaner; bottom rows have 7's filled downward incorrectly (e.g., row 19 has 7's extending right vs expected limited; unknown why vertical-up only didn't propagate 2's/4's properly to match expected positions like row 0 col 18=2).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_blocks serves similar purpose for seeds.
 * Diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful: e.g., apply_down_right's s = (r + 1) - (k + 1) and cc = rr - s often misaligns rays, leading to skipped or wrong fills (seen in train 1's 6-blob errors); don't rely on them without fixing slopes.
 * Horizontal and vertical_up are helpful and correct, as evidenced by partial matches in trains 1/3 (e.g., some lines filled right).
 * Iteration loop is essential but insufficient: processes all blocks per iter without immediate re-detection, missing chained growth (e.g., new 2x2 from partial fills not triggering until next iter, causing underfill in test/large grids).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond buggy diagonals; get_background and deepcopy are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it underfills massively, leaving most of the grid as 0's (bg) despite clear 2x2-ish seeds of 4's along the diagonal (rows 0-9, cols 0-9) and scattered 2's/3's/8's that should trigger growth; e.g., top-left 4's barely expand (only minor 8's in bottom-right row 25-27, and partial 7's in row 26), but expected should show full diagonal lines or blobs of 4's extending horizontally/up/diagonally, plus 2's growing into shapes, and 8's/7's completing patterns without overwriting 3's.
 * Differences: Row 0 has [4,0,0,...2,0,...4,0,...] with no fills vs expected likely full horizontal/diagonal 4-lines from seeds; row 10 has partial 8's/4's but no propagation to fill surrounding 0's upward/downward; bottom has isolated 7's/8's (e.g., row 26 [0,0,...8,7,7,7,7,7,7]) that seem overextended downward without matching any seed, suggesting diagonal bugs created phantom growth; overall, output looks sparse/incomplete (e.g., no 4-blob in center, 2's not expanded), failing to "complete" the visual puzzle into coherent shapes—likely due to iteration not converging fully or missed directions for this larger/varied grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block detection and expansion, where 2x2 seeds of the same non-background, non-special (3) color trigger filling of adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until hitting obstacles or edges, simulating growth or flood-fill mechanics to complete patterns like shapes, lines, or borders. The process iterates until no more expansions occur, with background determined by the most common cell value, and special rules for handling extensions from endpoints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value (e.g., 8 in examples); all expansions only fill bg cells and stop at non-bg/non-matching-color cells, including color 3 which acts as a blocker and is excluded from seed detection.
 * Seeds are strictly 2x2 blocks of identical color c (not bg or 3); they must be detected in a loop until the grid stabilizes, processing blocks in row-column order.
 * Expansions include: full horizontal lines left/right from the 2x2 (filling bg in both rows of the block, with special downward diagonal extensions from the last filled point if blocked); vertical lines up/down from both columns; and four diagonal directions (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) filling bg along the line.
 * Subtle: Horizontal expansions have asymmetric endpoint handling—leftward stops and potentially extends down-left from the last bg filled, rightward extends down-right; vertical and diagonal are symmetric but stop immediately at any non-bg/non-c.
 * Color 3 is "solid" or immovable—never expands from it, and it blocks all fills; other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,6,7,9) can be seeds if forming 2x2 and expand into bg only.
 * Grid can have irregular widths/heights, but examples are rectangular; iterations must use deepcopy to compare changes, avoiding infinite loops.
 * Patterns often form borders, diagonals, or enclosed shapes (e.g., 6's forming a blob in train1, 2's diagonal in train3); over-filling or missing extensions leads to scattered/incorrect placements.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals use sum/difference coordinates (e.g., r+k constant for one diag, r-k for the other); horizontal extensions only affect the two rows of the seed, not full grid height; no wrapping around edges.

            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][col] = c
            elif temp_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
```
(This handles vertical fills correctly from the two seed columns, skipping the seed rows themselves; helpful for line patterns.)

```python
def apply_diag_up_right(temp_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int):
    s = r + k + 1
    rr = r - 1
    while rr >= 0:
        cc = s - rr
        if cc < 0 or cc >= w:
            break
        if temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        elif temp_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        rr -= 1
```
(Example of diagonal fill using sum coordinate; similar for other diags—useful, but must ensure correct starting points beyond seed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated scattered horizontal 1's in top rows (e.g., row0: 8's with 1's at positions 2,23; row6: misplaced 4's and 1's) instead of expected vertical/diagonal stack of repeating 9-1 pairs (e.g., column9-10 has 9,1 vertically across rows); bottom 6's form incorrect partial lines (e.g., row20 has 6's from col2-5,13 but expected has structured shape with 6's in col9-10 shifting); 3's and 4's partially match but overfilled (unknown reason for 6's misalignment, possibly horizontal over-extension).
 * Train2 correct: All expansions matched expected, indicating core loop and vertical/diagonal logic works for simple cases.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated extra 2's in bottom-left (e.g., row7 col0-6 all 2's, but expected has only partial); 7's overfilled horizontally in row19 (full row0-7=7, but expected limits to col0-7); vertical 4's and 3's mostly match but 2's diagonal incomplete (e.g., missing 2's in rows0-4 col18-19); 3's in row13 col11-13 filled as 3,3,3 but expected has 3,3,3,8 (wait, generated has 3,3,3,4—mismatch at end, possibly diag overfill).
 * Train4 correct: Handled complex interactions (e.g., multiple colors, blockers) without overfill, showing horizontal+down-diag from points works in some scenarios.
 * Overall: Iteration loop stabilizes correctly (no infinite), but horizontal apply_left/right often overfills or misplaces endpoints (e.g., last_filled extensions trigger unintended down-diags); diag functions skip seed cells properly but may start from wrong offset; excluding 3 from seeds is good, but 3 blocks all directions subtly (e.g., train1 3's frame 4's/6's without expanding into them).
 * Function apply_horizontal (and sub-left/right) is broken/not fully helpful: Complex endpoint logic leads to incorrect down-left/right triggers (e.g., fills bg beyond blockers in train1/3); simplify or debug last_filled conditions.
 * apply_diag_down_left/up_right etc. are helpful but subtle coord errors (e.g., s = r + k +1 starts after seed, but may clip edges wrong in train3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows scattered 4's along a near-diagonal in top-left (rows0-10 cols0-10), 2's in irregular positions (e.g., row2 col19=2, row3 col20=2, but sparse and not forming clean lines), 3's only in rows11-12 cols5-6/10-13 (limited, possibly under-expanded), 8's as apparent secondary bg or blocker in mid-right (rows7-10 cols22-25), and 7's overfilled in bottom-right (row26 cols24-29 all 7's, row27 cols24-25/27-29=7 but irregular). Expected likely forms structured patterns like bordered shapes or diagonals (e.g., 4's completing a frame, 2's as a clean diag line, 7's contained without spillover, using 0 as bg), but generated has fragmented fills and no clear enclosure—suggests horizontal/diagonal over/under-extension, especially around 8's/3's as blockers.
 * Missing cohesive shapes: Top 4's don't connect into expected vertical/diagonal borders (e.g., row10 col5-9=8's interrupt); bottom 7's spill horizontally beyond probable 8-blockers (row25 col23-29), unlike contained 7's in train3 expected.
 * 3's underfilled: Only two small blocks, but test input has potential for more expansion around rows11-14 cols4-14; unknown if 8's are treated as bg (misidentified?) or blockers.
 * Makes sense partially for seed detection (e.g., potential 2x2 4's trigger top fills), but overall fragmented—update horizontal endpoint logic and ensure diags respect all blockers to handle test's wider grid (30 cols) and mixed 0/8/3.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:08:49] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where initial "seed" cells (non-background numbers, possibly including special markers like 3) form 2x2 blocks that trigger extensions or flood-fills in orthogonal and diagonal directions to create larger connected regions of the same color, ultimately transforming the grid into a solved state with coherent filled areas separated by background or blockers. The goal is to propagate colors correctly from these seeds without overfilling, underfilling, or ignoring special rules for elements like 3, while respecting grid boundaries and ensuring the final output matches expected patterns of uniform regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most common value, but propagation must not overwrite existing non-bg cells unless explicitly allowed (e.g., over 3 in some vertical cases); overpropagation into bg areas beyond intended limits is a common failure.
 * 2x2 blocks are the trigger: they must consist of the same non-bg, non-3 color; blocks are detected in a top-left to bottom-right scan, but extensions happen simultaneously on a temp grid to avoid interfering with each other in one iteration.
 * Extensions include: horizontal (left/right up to 4 bg cells on both rows of the block), vertical (up/down indefinitely on both columns, filling over bg and sometimes 3), and diagonals (up-left, up-right from block top; down-left, down-right from block bottom, filling consecutive bg cells along the diagonal line).
 * Special cases: A "special down-right" fill from horizontal extensions if 4 cells are filled on the top row right of the block; 3 acts as a partial blocker or seed—it's skipped in block detection but can be overwritten in vertical/diagonal fills, and may indicate boundaries or temporary markers that resolve into final colors.
 * Iterations continue until no more 2x2 blocks form, but cap at h*w to prevent infinite loops; order of block processing (sorted by row/col) matters for overlapping extensions.
 * Subtle elements: Diagonals use line equations (e.g., s = r - k for down-right) to trace paths precisely; horizontal is limited to exactly 4 cells per side to avoid overextension; vertical can go full height/width but stops at non-bg; do not fill over other colors—only bg (and 3 in specific cases); final grid should have large uniform regions (e.g., full rows/columns of one color) without stray seeds.
 * Across examples: 3 often borders filled regions or acts as a seed that gets overwritten; backgrounds like 8 or 9 dominate unfilled areas; test input has 0 as bg with seeds of 2,4,8 and 3, suggesting multi-color propagation without merging different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation can chain across iterations (new 2x2 form after one fill), diagonals must stay on-grid and stop exactly at non-bg; special horizontal-then-down-right fill only if exactly 4 consecutive cells are filled post-horizontal.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing fillable areas.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent processing order.)

The extension functions (apply_horizontal, apply_vertical, apply_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for orthogonal/diagonal fills but buggy in limits (e.g., horizontal caps at 4 but may over/under-apply; vertical overwrites 3 inconsistently; diagonals use correct line math but break prematurely on non-bg).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Generated overfilled with 9,1,4,6,8 in irregular patterns (e.g., scattered 1s and 6s in bottom-left, full rows of 4/8 in bottom-right), while expected has symmetric 8-dominant grid with thin 9/1/4 lines and 3-blockers forming a frame-like structure around central 3/4/1 areas; mismatches include extra 6-blobs (unknown reason, possibly erroneous vertical chaining) and failure to contain 1/4 to thin vertical/horizontal strips.
 * Training example 2: Generated all-4 grid (complete overfill), while expected has 8-bg with a small central 4-cross extended from 3-seeds, plus isolated 3s; missed containing fills to seed proximity and overwriting only specific paths, resulting in total grid domination by 4.
 * Training example 3: Generated mostly 2-bg with partial 7/4 fills in bottom and scattered 3s, while expected has 8-bg with layered 3/4/7/2 regions forming a more structured pattern (e.g., horizontal 4-band, vertical 2/4 lines, 7 in bottom-left, 3 as borders); mismatches include unfilled top areas (should be 8), incorrect 7-overextension into top rows, and failure to propagate 2/4 diagonally/vertically to match thin lines.
 * Training example 4: Generated all-6 grid (complete overfill again), while expected has 8-bg with a small 6-triangle extended from 3-seeds in top-left, tapering to single 6s; similar to example 2, overpropagated without limits, ignoring 3 as boundary.
 * Overall: The program correctly detects bg and initial blocks but fails in extension logic—horizontal/vertical/diagonal overextend beyond seeds (e.g., full-grid fills instead of bounded regions); special down-right case is underused or misplaced; iterations chain incorrectly, creating new blocks that propagate wrong colors; 3 is handled inconsistently (skipped in detection but partially filled over, leading to remnants); no color merging, but different colors bleed via temp_g updates.
 * Function `apply_horizontal` is helpful but broken (limits to 4 but applies to both rows without checking block context, causing wide bars where thin lines expected).
 * Function `apply_vertical` is partially helpful but incorrect (indefinite fill up/down overwrites too much, including stopping on 3 inconsistently; should respect more boundaries).
 * Diagonal functions (apply_up_left etc.) are conceptually good (use slope for lines) but unhelpful in practice—break on any non-bg too early or continue too far, missing chained diagonals.
 * The main `program` loop is essential but flawed (temp_g update after all blocks prevents intra-iteration chaining; max_iter too permissive, allowing overfills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., full blobs) was attempted, but it could help validate final regions—current approach lacks post-fill cleanup or 3-resolution.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it remains mostly 0-bg with scattered unchanged seeds (e.g., isolated 2s,4s,8s,3s in top/mid, minimal propagation like small 8-clusters in row 7-10 and bottom 7-band), failing to form coherent filled regions; for example, top-left 4-diagonal seeds don't extend into a full arm, mid 8/3 don't create a central blob, and bottom 7 doesn't propagate upward/leftward into a large area, leaving the grid sparse and unsolved.
 * It differs from expected (inferred from patterns): Should propagate 4 from top-left diagonal into a thick vertical/horizontal arm of 4s; 2s in mid-right into thin vertical 2-lines; 8/3 in rows 11-14 into a central 8-blob overwriting 3s; bottom 7 into a wide 7-band filling leftward/upward over 0s, with possible diagonal ties to 8; overall, expect 70-80% filled with uniform color blocks (4 top-left, 8 center, 7 bottom, 2 accents) instead of 90%+ 0s.
 * The output makes partial sense for initial seeds but not for propagation—diagonals are barely touched (e.g., no full up-right from row7 col23 8s), verticals don't chain (e.g., row15-22 4s stay isolated), suggesting the extension functions trigger but stop prematurely or skip blocks due to 3/0 checks; to handle test, need bounded fills (e.g., stop at 3 unless vertical) and more iterations for chaining.

[2025-10-01 02:08:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or flood-filling, where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 cells trigger propagation of that color along straight lines (horizontal, vertical) and possibly diagonals, filling adjacent background cells until blocked by other colors or 3s, with the goal of transforming the input grid to match an expected filled pattern. The background color is dynamically determined (e.g., most common cell value), and 3 appears to act as a special blocker or non-fillable element.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is identified as the most frequent cell value in the grid, but this may not always align with the expected output's dominant color (e.g., in Training 1, generated uses 9 as bg but expected uses 8, leading to over-filling with 9s instead of 8s).
 * 2x2 blocks are detected only if all four cells match a color c != bg and c != 3; blocks are sorted by row then column for processing order, which may affect iteration stability.
 * Propagation occurs from detected 2x2 blocks in multiple directions: horizontal (left/right from the block's rows, skipping over c or 3 but stopping at other colors), vertical (up/down from the block's columns), and four diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) starting from each corner of the block, again filling only bg cells and stopping at non-c/non-3/non-bg.
 * The process iterates up to h*w times or until no blocks or changes occur, using a deepcopy to avoid mutating the original; however, applying propagations to all blocks in a single pass per iteration can cause over-filling or interference between blocks.
 * 3 cells are never filled or used as seeds but block propagation; other colors (e.g., 1,4,6,7,8,9) can be seeds or blockers depending on context.
 * Subtle element: Propagation does not fill within the 2x2 block itself (already filled) and starts strictly outside (e.g., horizontal from k-1 left and k+2 right); diagonals are one-directional from each corner and may not connect properly across the grid.
 * Grids can be irregular in shape/content (e.g., sparse with many 0s in test), and propagation must respect bounds without wrapping.
 * Order of processing blocks and directions matters; current top-to-bottom, left-to-right may miss dependencies where later blocks rely on earlier fills.
 * Easy to miss: Not all lines need full-grid spanning; partial fills stop at blockers, and multiple overlapping propagations from different blocks/colors must resolve without overwriting (current code allows it, leading to inconsistencies).
 * 0 may represent a special bg variant or empty, but treated as fillable like other bg; in test, excessive 0s remain unfilled or wrongly filled.
 * Iterations may loop inefficiently if new blocks form mid-process; current code re-finds blocks each iteration but applies to all at once.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as bg, useful for initialization, though it may need adjustment if bg isn't strictly most common.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by row then col
```
(This is helpful for detecting seed 2x2 blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent order.)

The apply_* functions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for directional filling logic, as they correctly skip over c/3 and stop at other colors while filling bg, but they are broken for multi-block interactions (e.g., they apply unconditionally per block without checking post-fill state, leading to overwrites).

No types like PuzzleElement are present, but tp.List[tp.List[int]] is a good type hint for grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects 2x2 blocks and attempts line-based propagation but fails overall due to incorrect bg choice or over-aggressive filling.
 * Training 1: Generated over-fills top rows with 9s (assuming 9 as bg) and scatters 1s/4s/6s/3s incorrectly (e.g., row 0 has all 9s except ends with 1/8, but expected has mostly 8s with patterned 9/1/4/3/6); bottom sections have mismatched 6/3/8 placements (e.g., generated row 20 has 6,3,6,6,9,... but expected has 8,3,6,6,6,...); unknown why 8s appear sporadically instead of dominating as in expected.
 * Training 2: Generated fills almost entirely with 4s and leaves 3s isolated (e.g., row 2: [4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4] vs expected [8,3,3,4,3,8,8,8]), failing to propagate 8s as bg and expand shapes like the 3-triangle; bottom rows all 4s but expected has 4s only in specific positions with 8s elsewhere.
 * Training 3: Generated leaves large top areas as 2s (bg?) and poorly expands 3/4/7 patterns (e.g., row 5: [2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,...] with 8s filling bg areas); lower sections have fragmented 4/7/3 (e.g., row 11: [2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,2,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]), missing full 8-fills and shape completions.
 * Training 4: Generated mostly 6s with isolated 3s (e.g., row 2: [6,3,6,3,6,6,...] vs expected [8,3,6,3,6,8,...]), failing to introduce 8s as bg and expand the 3-pattern downward/rightward properly; bottom rows all 6s but expected has all 8s.
 * All trainings show under-filling of bg (e.g., 8s in expected) and incorrect color dominance; propagation seems to activate but doesn't match expected shapes (e.g., doesn't create the connected 8-regions or precise 3/4/6 blobs).
 * Function `program` is helpful as a main loop but broken in iteration logic (applies all propagations before re-checking blocks, causing chain reactions that overwrite expected patterns).
 * Diagonal functions are unhelpful or broken: they start from corners but don't connect lines properly (e.g., in Training 1, diagonals may cause stray 4s/1s not seen in expected straight-line fills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs or shapes) is present, but it would be essential for identifying complete patterns beyond just 2x2 seeds; current code lacks blob detection or connectivity checks.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and directional fills but misses bg correctness, propagation stopping rules, and handling of multi-color interactions.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves excessive 0s unfilled (e.g., most of the grid is still 0s, with sparse 4s along a diagonal-ish pattern in top-left, 2s scattered, and small 8/3/7 clusters in bottom-right), suggesting minimal propagation occurred—likely because bg=0 (most common) and few/no valid 2x2 blocks were detected or propagation stopped immediately due to blockers/3s.
 * It fails to create cohesive filled regions (e.g., the 8s in rows 6-7 and 25-28 are tiny and isolated, not expanding to cover bg areas as expected in trainings; 7s in bottom appear fragmented vs. potential full lines).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from trainings): Expected likely has a dominant bg (e.g., 0 or 8) filling large areas, with 2/4/3/7/8 propagating into shapes like lines or blobs from seeds, but generated has no such expansion—e.g., top rows have isolated 4s/2s but no horizontal/vertical fills connecting them, and bottom 7s don't form the connected patterns seen in training expectations.
 * Unknown why so many 0s persist (perhaps no 2x2 seeds at all, or propagation skips over 0s incorrectly); it doesn't make sense as a solved puzzle, as it looks like a barely modified input rather than a completed pattern.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where initial "seed" cells (non-background numbers, possibly including special markers like 3) form 2x2 blocks that trigger extensions or flood-fills in orthogonal and diagonal directions to create larger connected regions of the same color, ultimately transforming the grid into a solved state with coherent filled areas separated by background or blockers. The goal is to propagate colors correctly from these seeds without overfilling, underfilling, or ignoring special rules for elements like 3, while respecting grid boundaries and ensuring the final output matches expected patterns of uniform regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most common value, but propagation must not overwrite existing non-bg cells unless explicitly allowed (e.g., over 3 in some vertical cases); overpropagation into bg areas beyond intended limits is a common failure.
 * 2x2 blocks are the trigger: they must consist of the same non-bg, non-3 color; blocks are detected in a top-left to bottom-right scan, but extensions happen simultaneously on a temp grid to avoid interfering with each other in one iteration.
 * Extensions include: horizontal (left/right up to 4 bg cells on both rows of the block), vertical (up/down indefinitely on both columns, filling over bg and sometimes 3), and diagonals (up-left, up-right from block top; down-left, down-right from block bottom, filling consecutive bg cells along the diagonal line).
 * Special cases: A "special down-right" fill from horizontal extensions if 4 cells are filled on the top row right of the block; 3 acts as a partial blocker or seed—it's skipped in block detection but can be overwritten in vertical/diagonal fills, and may indicate boundaries or temporary markers that resolve into final colors.
 * Iterations continue until no more 2x2 blocks form, but cap at h*w to prevent infinite loops; order of block processing (sorted by row/col) matters for overlapping extensions.
 * Subtle elements: Diagonals use line equations (e.g., s = r - k for down-right) to trace paths precisely; horizontal is limited to exactly 4 cells per side to avoid overextension; vertical can go full height/width but stops at non-bg; do not fill over other colors—only bg (and 3 in specific cases); final grid should have large uniform regions (e.g., full rows/columns of one color) without stray seeds.
 * Across examples: 3 often borders filled regions or acts as a seed that gets overwritten; backgrounds like 8 or 9 dominate unfilled areas; test input has 0 as bg with seeds of 2,4,8 and 3, suggesting multi-color propagation without merging different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Propagation can chain across iterations (new 2x2 form after one fill), diagonals must stay on-grid and stop exactly at non-bg; special horizontal-then-down-right fill only if exactly 4 consecutive cells are filled post-horizontal.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing fillable areas.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately, excluding bg and 3; sorting ensures consistent processing order.)

The extension functions (apply_horizontal, apply_vertical, apply_up_left, etc.) are partially helpful for orthogonal/diagonal fills but buggy in limits (e.g., horizontal caps at 4 but may over/under-apply; vertical overwrites 3 inconsistently; diagonals use correct line math but break prematurely on non-bg).

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Generated overfilled with 9,1,4,6,8 in irregular patterns (e.g., scattered 1s and 6s in bottom-left, full rows of 4/8 in bottom-right), while expected has symmetric 8-dominant grid with thin 9/1/4 lines and 3-blockers forming a frame-like structure around central 3/4/1 areas; mismatches include extra 6-blobs (unknown reason, possibly erroneous vertical chaining) and failure to contain 1/4 to thin vertical/horizontal strips.
 * Training example 2: Generated all-4 grid (complete overfill), while expected has 8-bg with a small central 4-cross extended from 3-seeds, plus isolated 3s; missed containing fills to seed proximity and overwriting only specific paths, resulting in total grid domination by 4.
 * Training example 3: Generated mostly 2-bg with partial 7/4 fills in bottom and scattered 3s, while expected has 8-bg with layered 3/4/7/2 regions forming a more structured pattern (e.g., horizontal 4-band, vertical 2/4 lines, 7 in bottom-left, 3 as borders); mismatches include unfilled top areas (should be 8), incorrect 7-overextension into top rows, and failure to propagate 2/4 diagonally/vertically to match thin lines.
 * Training example 4: Generated all-6 grid (complete overfill again), while expected has 8-bg with a small 6-triangle extended from 3-seeds in top-left, tapering to single 6s; similar to example 2, overpropagated without limits, ignoring 3 as boundary.
 * Overall: The program correctly detects bg and initial blocks but fails in extension logic—horizontal/vertical/diagonal overextend beyond seeds (e.g., full-grid fills instead of bounded regions); special down-right case is underused or misplaced; iterations chain incorrectly, creating new blocks that propagate wrong colors; 3 is handled inconsistently (skipped in detection but partially filled over, leading to remnants); no color merging, but different colors bleed via temp_g updates.
 * Function `apply_horizontal` is helpful but broken (limits to 4 but applies to both rows without checking block context, causing wide bars where thin lines expected).
 * Function `apply_vertical` is partially helpful but incorrect (indefinite fill up/down overwrites too much, including stopping on 3 inconsistently; should respect more boundaries).
 * Diagonal functions (apply_up_left etc.) are conceptually good (use slope for lines) but unhelpful in practice—break on any non-bg too early or continue too far, missing chained diagonals.
 * The main `program` loop is essential but flawed (temp_g update after all blocks prevents intra-iteration chaining; max_iter too permissive, allowing overfills).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., full blobs) was attempted, but it could help validate final regions—current approach lacks post-fill cleanup or 3-resolution.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it remains mostly 0-bg with scattered unchanged seeds (e.g., isolated 2s,4s,8s,3s in top/mid, minimal propagation like small 8-clusters in row 7-10 and bottom 7-band), failing to form coherent filled regions; for example, top-left 4-diagonal seeds don't extend into a full arm, mid 8/3 don't create a central blob, and bottom 7 doesn't propagate upward/leftward into a large area, leaving the grid sparse and unsolved.
 * It differs from expected (inferred from patterns): Should propagate 4 from top-left diagonal into a thick vertical/horizontal arm of 4s; 2s in mid-right into thin vertical 2-lines; 8/3 in rows 11-14 into a central 8-blob overwriting 3s; bottom 7 into a wide 7-band filling leftward/upward over 0s, with possible diagonal ties to 8; overall, expect 70-80% filled with uniform color blocks (4 top-left, 8 center, 7 bottom, 2 accents) instead of 90%+ 0s.
 * The output makes partial sense for initial seeds but not for propagation—diagonals are barely touched (e.g., no full up-right from row7 col23 8s), verticals don't chain (e.g., row15-22 4s stay isolated), suggesting the extension functions trigger but stop prematurely or skip blocks due to 3/0 checks; to handle test, need bounded fills (e.g., stop at 3 unless vertical) and more iterations for chaining.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid completion or pattern propagation, where the goal is to identify "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color and extend those colors outward in specific directions (horizontal lines, vertical upward fills, and certain diagonals) to form complete shapes or objects, likely simulating a kind of flood-fill or rule-based drawing puzzle. The background color (most common value) is ignored, and iterations are applied until no more changes occur, but the rules must precisely match the expected shapes without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rule: Detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background cells as "seeds"; these trigger fills only in empty (background) spaces, stopping at boundaries, other colors, or grid edges.
 * Horizontal fills: For a seed at (r,k), extend left/right in the top row (r) from k-1 and k+2, and separately in the bottom row (r+1) from k-1 and k+2—but only if those positions are background; this creates straight lines but can miss if seeds are adjacent or if fills need to connect across multiple iterations.
 * Vertical fills: Only upward (from the top of the seed at r-1) in the left (k) and right (k+1) columns, filling until non-background or edge; no downward or sideways verticals, which may explain misses in bottom-heavy patterns.
 * Diagonal fills: Up-right diagonal starts from above the seed (rr = r-1, cc = r+k+1 - rr) and fills while background and in bounds; down-left diagonal starts below (rr = r+2, cc = (r+1+k) - rr) and fills downward—subtlety: these are anti-diagonals (sum of indices constant), and they stop at non-background, but may not handle mirrored or other diagonal directions (e.g., up-left or down-right).
 * Iterations: Loop up to height times, re-finding blocks each time to allow propagation; but over-iteration can cause unwanted fills if blocks form mid-process, or under-iteration if h is too small.
 * Background detection: Use most common value; assumes uniform background, but if ties or multi-backgrounds, it fails—easy to miss in varied grids.
 * Subtleties: Fills must not overwrite existing non-background cells (only background); seeds are only non-background 2x2; no fills for single cells or larger blocks initially; patterns like the "1" and "9" in example 1 seem to form diagonal or stepped shapes, suggesting diagonals are key but current implementation under-fills vertical/diagonal connections; example 3 shows incomplete horizontal/vertical extensions for "2" and "4", indicating missing downward vertical or bidirectional horizontal rules; test input has scattered seeds (3,4,2,8,7), so propagation must handle multiple colors without bleeding; subtle: some expected outputs have asymmetric fills (e.g., "1" and "4" shifting rightward), implying direction-specific rules; avoid filling across colors or into solid areas; iterations may need to alternate fill types to propagate correctly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This is helpful for reliably identifying the background color via frequency count; it's accurate and simple.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful as the core seed detector for 2x2 non-background blocks; it's precise but only finds top-left corners, which works for propagation if iterations re-scan.)

(The apply_* functions are partially helpful for directional fills but broken in specifics—e.g., apply_horizontal_top/bottom miss connecting to existing same-color cells, apply_vertical_ups only goes up (not down), and diagonals are direction-limited; retain but fix for bidirectionality.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated scattered "9","1","4" in upper grid with incorrect positions (e.g., "9" at row0 col15 instead of expected clustered near col8-9; "1" fragmented across rows 6-16 without full vertical stack; "4" at row7 col18 but missing rightward extension; bottom "3","6" filled horizontally but "6" overextends into row21 without expected "1","4" overlay. Expected has tighter "9-1" diagonal/stepped shape in cols8-10, rows0-23, with "4" aligned rightward and "6" confined. Unknown why diagonals didn't propagate "1" fully—possibly missing up-left diagonal or iteration order.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): Fully matched expected (details not provided), suggesting the approach works for simple horizontal/vertical patterns but fails complex ones.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated "2" scattered in rows2-5 cols16-18 without full vertical fill to row0 col18; "4" in row2 col18 but missing connections to row0-1; bottom "7" and "3" partially filled but no propagation to top. Expected has "2" as a vertical line from row0 col18 down to row7 col16, with "4" staggered rightward (col18 to col19); upper "3-2" horizontal but vertical "2" incomplete. Difference: missing downward vertical fills and right-horizontal extensions; apply_vertical_ups only handles up, ignoring down.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Fully matched (details not provided), likely a case where upward/diagonal rules sufficed without needing downward fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal fills work for straight lines (e.g., "6" in ex1, "4" bars in ex3) but fail to connect or extend bidirectionally; verticals only upward, missing downward (key fail in ex3 "2"); diagonals partial—up-right works somewhat for "1" in ex1 but misses left/down variants; iterations (h times) may be insufficient for chain reactions; no object extraction function present, but find_blocks acts as one—useful but doesn't group by color/shape.
 * Function apply_diagonal_down_left is unhelpful/broken: Fills downward but starts at r+2 with incorrect sum s = r+1+k (should be r+k+1 for consistency?), and breaks too early on bounds, missing expected down-left in ex3.
 * Function apply_horizontal_bottom/top are helpful but incomplete: They fill left/right but only from seed edges, not merging with adjacent same-color; don't handle full-row spans.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: Input has scattered seeds like vertical "3" in col16 rows0-9, "4" in col22 rows0-9 shifting right, "2" in col29 rows2-9, "8" block in rows7-9 cols22-25, "3-8-4" in rows10-13 cols4-13, "7" diagonal in col29 rows22-29, and "8-7" in rows25-27 cols23-29. Expected should propagate "3" into a full vertical/diagonal shape leftward/upward (e.g., filling row0-9 col15-16 with "3"), "4" into horizontal bars rightward (e.g., row0 col22-29 "4"), "2" into a stepped diagonal up-left (e.g., row0 col27-29 "2"), "8" into a filled rectangle or cross (but generated has isolated "8"s without full bottom fill), "7" into a downward diagonal from row22 col29 to row29 col22 (generated has partial "7" horizontal in row26 but misses full diagonal chain). Differences: Under-fills verticals downward (e.g., no "3" below row9), incomplete diagonals (e.g., "2" not extending to row0 col27), and "8-7" block not propagating left/up fully; over-fills nothing obvious, but scattered "0"s remain where fills should connect (e.g., row10-13 "3-4" should extend horizontally to col0-30). It handles some horizontals (e.g., row11-12 "3-4") but misses bidirectional vertical/diagonal rules, similar to training fails—likely incorrect without downward and up-left fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based "growth" or "flood fill" mechanics where certain seed patterns (like 2x2 blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color) trigger expansion of colored regions into adjacent background cells along specific directions (horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal lines), ultimately filling predefined shapes or blobs while preserving existing structures and avoiding over-expansion or incorrect merging. The goal is to simulate iterative expansion until no more valid triggers exist, resulting in a final grid that matches expected filled patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically determined as the most common cell value (e.g., 8 or 0), and expansions only overwrite background cells—never existing colors, 3's (which seem to act as barriers or fixed non-fillable elements), or other blocks.
 * Expansion triggers on 2x2 blocks of the same color c (excluding 3 and background), but only if they form a "corner" or seed for line-based growth; the program iterates until no new blocks are found, but must avoid infinite loops (capped at h*w iterations).
 * Directions for expansion include left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's edges, up/down vertical lines from its sides, and potentially diagonal lines (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) starting from the block's corners, but only filling consecutive background cells in straight lines without skipping or branching.
 * Subtlety: Expansions happen simultaneously across all detected blocks in each iteration (using a temp grid to avoid partial updates affecting others), and the process repeats until stabilization; however, diagonals must align precisely with the block's position (e.g., using sum/difference of row+col for anti/main diagonals) and stop at boundaries or non-background.
 * 3's are special: They block all expansions and are never overwritten or used as seeds, suggesting they are walls or outlines for shapes.
 * Patterns in expected outputs show "blobs" or shapes (e.g., letters/numbers formed by filling with a color like 6 into a 3-outlined area) and linear extensions (e.g., diagonals of 9-1 or horizontal 4's extending to edges).
 * Easy to miss: Not all directions always apply (e.g., some examples need vertical fill to top/bottom edges, others diagonal to connect shapes); over-filling occurs if diagonals are miscalculated (e.g., wrong starting sum s for diagonal lines); blocks must be sorted by position to process in order, but simultaneous application prevents order-dependence.
 * Iterations must propagate: A single 2x2 can create new 2x2's in subsequent iterations, leading to chain reactions (e.g., filling a long horizontal line that then seeds verticals).
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x8 in ex1, 8x8 in ex2), and empty rows/columns of background should remain unfilled unless triggered.
 * No merging of different colors; each block expands its own c independently.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]

(This correctly identifies the background color, essential for all expansions.)

            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately, excluding 3's and background; sorting ensures consistent processing order.)

                temp_g[rr][cc] = c
                cc += 1
```
(This correctly fills left/right horizontal lines from the 2x2's bottom/top edges into background.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: List[List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> None:
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        rr = r - 1

            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr -= 1
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][col] = c
            rr += 1
```
(This correctly fills up/down vertical lines from the 2x2's left/right sides into background.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**

            break
        temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        rr += 1
```
(These are broken: Incorrect starting sums (s) lead to wrong diagonal alignments; e.g., up-right uses s = r + k + 1, which offsets incorrectly and causes over/under-filling or misalignment with block corners. They partially fill in some cases but fail to match expected linear diagonals, like the 9-1 patterns in ex1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies background (8 or 0) and detects 2x2 blocks, successfully triggering some horizontal/vertical fills (e.g., in ex2, it fills some 4's horizontally but misses vertical extension to row 0; in ex4, it fills some 6's but misses top-row extension).
 * Horizontal and vertical applies work well for straight-line extensions (e.g., in ex1 bottom, partial 6-filling into the 3-outlined shape; in ex3, some 2/4/7 fills occur but don't propagate fully).
 * What didn't work: Diagonal functions are fundamentally flawed, causing incorrect or missing fills (e.g., in ex1, top diagonal 9-1 pattern is scattered/misplaced instead of clean vertical repetition; bottom 6's don't fully fill the shape due to poor diagonal chaining; in ex3, 2's and 7's don't extend to expected positions like row 0 col 6 or the 3-7 shape).
 * Iteration logic is mostly sound (uses temp_g for simultaneous updates, breaks on no change), but max_iter cap prevents infinite loops while allowing propagation; however, it over-applies in some spots (e.g., ex1 row 7 col 18 has extra 4 where expected has 8).
 * In ex1, generated has scattered 1's/9's in top rows (e.g., row 0: 8's with 1 at col2 and 9 at col15) vs. expected clean diagonal-like repetition of [9,1] blocks extending vertically; bottom 6's fill partially but leave gaps (e.g., row 20 col2=6 but expected has more structured 6's aligned with 3's).
 * In ex2, generated misses vertical 4-fill to row0 col3 (stays 8, expected=4) and doesn't fill row6 col0=4; partial horizontal 4's in row4 are correct but incomplete.
 * In ex3, generated leaves many areas unfilled (e.g., no 2's in top rows like expected row0 col18=2; 7's in bottom don't match exact shape; 4's in col13 are partial); 3's block correctly but expansions stop prematurely.
 * In ex4, generated misses vertical 6-fill to row0 col2/5 (stays 8, expected=6 at row6 col0 but wait, expected has 6 only at row6 col0? No, ex4 expected has 6 at row6 col0 but generated doesn't; actually ex4 generated matches most but misses row0 extensions).
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of 2x2 seeds and line-fills but fails on diagonals and full propagation, leading to incomplete shapes (e.g., unfilled tops/bottoms in ex2/ex4); no extraction of "objects" or blobs attempted, which might help identify target shapes bounded by 3's.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; with 0 as background, it shows partial scattered fills (e.g., diagonal-ish 4's in top-left, some 2's along a near-diagonal in cols 17-29, 8's forming a small block in rows 7-10 cols 22-25, 3's/4's in rows 11-14 cols 4-13, and 7's filling a shape in bottom rows 24-28 cols 24-29 bounded by 8's), but it appears under-filled and misaligned compared to expected mechanics.
 * Issues: Top 4's don't extend fully horizontally/vertically (e.g., row0 col1=4 but no left/right fill into 0's); 2's are placed but don't chain into longer lines or fill shapes (e.g., row2 col28=2 isolated); 8-block in mid doesn't expand; bottom 7's fill some but leave gaps (e.g., row26 col25=7 but expected likely full horizontal/vertical into 0's); no clear propagation from 2x2 seeds to match shape outlines (e.g., potential 3-barriers around 7's not fully utilized); overall, it resembles the training errors with partial but incorrect expansions, suggesting diagonal bugs prevent proper test filling (e.g., the 2's look like attempted diagonal but offset wrong, and 7's don't reach edges like in ex2/4 expectations).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or filled cells against a background (most common value, often 8 or 0), where the goal is to detect 2x2 blocks of identical non-background colors and propagate (fill) that color in specific directions from those blocks to complete patterns, such as shapes, lines, or diagonals, while leaving the background unchanged.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells and stop at non-background or grid boundaries.
 * Core trigger: Identify 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color (e.g., rows r and r+1, columns k and k+1 all equal to c ≠ bg); these act as "seeds" for propagation.
 * Propagations from each 2x2 block (r, k, c):
   - Horizontal: Fill the bottom row (r+1) of the block leftward and rightward along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Vertical: From the top of the block (row r), fill upward (decreasing rows) in both the left column (k) and right column (k+1) along consecutive background cells until hitting a non-background.
   - Diagonal up-right: From the bottom-right of the block, fill diagonally upward-right (decreasing row, increasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
   - Diagonal down-left: From the top-left of the block, fill diagonally downward-left (increasing row, decreasing column, along constant row + column sum) through background cells until boundary or non-background.
 * Order of operations matters: Apply horizontal bottom first, then vertical ups, then diagonal up-right, then diagonal down-left; later fills can overwrite previous ones if they target the same cell.
 * Subtleties: Fills do not cross existing non-background cells (stop immediately); multiple blocks can overlap or extend each other's fills; diagonals use sum-based indexing (e.g., s = r + k + 1 for up-right from bottom-right); horizontal fills are only on the bottom row and can extend beyond the block's width if open; vertical fills start from the block's top row upward; no downward or rightward vertical fills; no fills into the block itself or below/up from non-adjacent areas.
 * Edge cases: Grids with varying widths/heights; blocks near edges (e.g., no fill if out of bounds); multiple overlapping blocks of same/different colors; background can be 0, 8, etc.; no creation of new blocks—only extend from detected 2x2 seeds.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonal directions are asymmetric (up-right from bottom-right seed point, down-left from top-left); horizontal is bottom-only and bidirectional but stops at non-bg; vertical is upward-only from both sides; fills propagate maximally until blocked, but only along straight lines/diagonals; no wrapping around grid edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the most common value; essential for all non-fill decisions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if (c != bg and
                g[r][k + 1] == c and
                g[r + 1][k] == c and
                g[r + 1][k + 1] == c):
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seed blocks; core to the puzzle—keep and use in future attempts.)

```python
def apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        rr = r + 1  # bottom row of block
        if rr >= len(new_g):
            continue
        # right fill in bottom row if open right
        if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k + 2, w):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
        # left fill in bottom row if open left
        if k - 1 >= 0 and new_g[rr][k - 1] == bg:
            for cc in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
                if new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                    break
                new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This handles bottom-row horizontal extensions bidirectionally but only if adjacent cell is bg; partially correct but buggy—right fill condition `if k + 2 < w and new_g[rr][k + 1 + 1] == bg` is redundant/wrong since k+1 is already c, and it skips filling k+1 if needed; left fill starts from k-1 but assumes openness; misses filling if the block's bottom is already partially filled.)

```python
def apply_vertical_ups(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int) -> None:
    h = len(new_g)
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= len(new_g[0]):
            continue
        # vertical up from left column k starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k] = c
        # vertical up from right column k+1 starting from row r
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            if new_g[rr][k + 1] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][k + 1] = c
```
(This correctly fills upward from the block's top row in both columns until blocked; helpful but starts from r (top of block), which may miss if block top is not open—works if assuming block top is the starting point.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if k + 1 >= w:
            continue
        s = r + k + 1
        for rr in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts up-right diagonal from a sum s = r + k + 1, but starting from r-1; partially correct but sum may be wrong—should likely start from bottom-right (r+1, k+1) and go up-right with s = (r+1) + (k+1); current s leads to incorrect paths, e.g., misses direct extension from block.)

```python
def apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], blocks: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]], bg: int, h: int, w: int) -> None:
    for r, k, c in blocks:
        if r + 1 >= h or k >= w:
            continue
        s = (r + 1) + k
        for rr in range(r + 2, h):
            cc = s - rr
            if not (0 <= cc < w) or new_g[rr][cc] != bg:
                break
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
```
(This attempts down-left diagonal but sum s = (r+1) + k is incorrect for down-left from top-left; starts from r+2, skipping immediate below; direction (decreasing cc as rr increases) is right for down-left, but path misses block-adjacent cells and sum is off, leading to wrong diagonals.)

```python
def program(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    bg = get_background(g)
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    blocks = find_blocks(g, bg)
    apply_horizontal_bottom(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_vertical_ups(new_g, blocks, bg)
    apply_diagonal_up_right(new_g, blocks, bg, w)
    apply_diagonal_down_left(new_g, blocks, bg, h, w)
    return new_g
```
(This orchestrates the steps correctly in order but relies on buggy apply functions; copying grid is good to avoid mutating input.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated partial vertical/horizontal fills for 9's and 1's (e.g., scattered 9's upward but not fully diagonal), but missed full diagonal extensions of 9-1 pattern across top-left (expected has symmetric 9-1 diagonals filling multiple rows/columns); bottom 6's only partially filled horizontally (generated has isolated 6's, expected has connected 6 shape spanning rows 20-23 with diagonal integration); 3's and 4's in middle filled somewhat but not extended to match expected blob shapes; unknown why 6's didn't propagate fully—possibly diagonal sum wrong.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched expected, suggesting the approach works for simpler or non-overlapping block cases.
 * Training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated vertical fills for 2's and 3's partially (e.g., 2's in row 6-7 but not extended rightward to full row in expected); horizontal bottom for 4's missed (generated has no row 11 full of 4's, expected has horizontal 4's spanning columns 0-10); 7's only partially filled downward (generated has scattered 7's in row 18, expected has full horizontal 7's in row 18); 2's in top-right not diagonal-extended properly (generated stops early, expected connects to 4's); apply_diagonal functions likely failed to hit correct paths.
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): All patterns completed accurately, indicating success on cases with clear vertical/horizontal dominance without heavy diagonal overlap.
 * Overall: Horizontal and vertical applies are mostly functional but buggy in edge/openness checks (e.g., skipping block-adjacent cells); diagonal applies are broken due to incorrect starting sums/points (e.g., up-right should seed from (r+1,k+1), down-left from (r,k)); order helps but later steps don't overwrite correctly for overlaps; find_blocks is solid; no extraction of full objects needed—focus on per-block propagation.
 * Function `apply_diagonal_up_right` and `apply_diagonal_down_left` are incorrect (wrong sums/starting points lead to missed or wrong fills—revise heavily, don't reuse as-is).
 * Function `apply_horizontal_bottom` is partially helpful but broken (redundant conditions prevent full extension—fix openness checks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial diagonal fills for 3's (rows 0-9, columns decreasing), 4's (rows 10-20, shifting right), 2's (rows 2-9, right side), and some 8's/7's at bottom (rows 25-28, horizontal 7's in row 26 but incomplete), but misses key extensions: no full vertical upward fills from detected blocks (e.g., 3's in row 11-12 should extend up more); horizontal bottoms are absent (e.g., no extension of 4's in row 12 left/right); diagonals are off-path (e.g., 2's diagonal stops abruptly without connecting to potential 8's block; 7's in row 26 not extended left to full row or diagonally); added 8's in rows 7-10 seem erroneous (possibly from miscomputed diagonal, overwriting bg incorrectly); overall, patterns like the 8-block in rows 11-13 and 25-28 aren't propagated fully (expected likely has longer diagonals for 3-4-2 connecting top-right to bottom, and horizontal 7's spanning more); doesn't match mental run of rules (e.g., 2x2 of 8's at row7 col22-23 should fill up-right diagonal, but generated has isolated 8's).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers where the goal is to complete or extend partial shapes (lines, blocks, or patterns of specific colors) starting from "seed" 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, by iteratively filling adjacent background cells in horizontal, vertical, and possibly diagonal directions until boundaries are hit, effectively "growing" connected regions of each color without overwriting existing non-matching non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); all fills only target background cells.
 * Core trigger: Detect 2x2 squares of identical non-background color as starting points ("blocks"); extensions only propagate the block's color (c).
 * Extensions: From each 2x2 block at (r, k), fill horizontally along the two rows (r and r+1) left/right from the block's edges, stopping at non-background non-c cells; vertically along the two columns (k and k+1) up/down from the block's edges, stopping similarly; diagonals are attempted (up-right from top-left, down-left from bottom-left), but these seem buggy or incomplete as they don't fully match expectations (e.g., limited to specific directions and may over/under-fill).
 * Iteration: Process in a loop until no changes, with blocks re-detected each iteration; sorting blocks by row (ascending) affects order and can cause cascading fills in unintended ways if not handled carefully.
 * Boundaries: Fills stop at grid edges or when hitting a cell that is non-background and not equal to c (do not overwrite other colors); only fill if the target is background.
 * Subtleties: Diagonal fills are asymmetric and only applied in specific directions (e.g., up-right and down-left only, not full diagonals), which may miss patterns like the slanted 1/4/9 lines in training 1 or the 2's in training 3; horizontal/vertical fills apply to both rows/columns of the block but may need separate calls for upper/lower or left/right segments; over-filling occurs if iterations don't re-check blocks properly (e.g., creating false 2x2 seeds); under-filling happens if diagonals or multi-step propagations (e.g., chaining blocks) are ignored; colors like 6 in training 1 expected output suggest temporary or intermediate fills that resolve to other colors, but code doesn't handle color changes; grid sizes vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, 30x30 in test), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; no merging of same-color regions unless triggered by 2x2; potential for multiple blocks of same color needing coordinated fills without interference.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the background as the mode, essential for all fills; works across examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0])
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks
```
(This detects valid 2x2 seed blocks accurately; sorting by row in the main loop helps with top-to-bottom propagation but may need adjustment for left-to-right or priority.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], rr: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    # right
    cc = k + 2
    while cc < w:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc += 1
    # left
    cc = k - 1
    while cc >= 0:
        if new_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            new_g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        cc -= 1
    return changed
```
(This extends horizontally on a single row from a block edge; called separately for the two block rows—works for straight lines but misses if blocks are adjacent without re-detection.)

```python
def apply_vertical(new_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], col: int, r: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, up: bool) -> bool:
    changed = False
    if up:
        step = -1
        start = r - 1
        stop = -1
    else:
        step = 1
        start = r + 2
        stop = h
    rr = start
    while (up and rr >= 0) or (not up and rr < h):
        if new_g[rr][col] == bg:
            new_g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
        elif new_g[rr][col] != c:
            break
        rr += step
    return changed
```
(This extends vertically up or down from a block edge on a single column; called for both block columns and both directions—generally helpful but starts from wrong offsets in some cases, e.g., down starts at r+2 assuming block at r/r+1.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided code) correctly handles basic horizontal and vertical extensions for some cases (e.g., training 2 and 4 passed fully, filling straight lines and blocks like the 4's and 3's in training 3's bottom but missing slants).
 * Failed in training 1: Generated over-filled scattered 9's, 1's, and 4's in the top-left (e.g., 9's appear in rows 0-5 columns 14-15 but expected are clustered diagonally as [9,1] pairs shifting right/down); introduced erroneous 6's in row 21 columns 2-7 (expected no 6's, instead a diagonal 6 line in rows 20-23 columns 8-11); the 3-block in rows 9-12 didn't fully connect horizontally/vertically to match expected symmetry; diagonal functions applied but incorrectly (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right filled wrong positions, creating mismatches like extra 1's in row 2 column 21).
 * Succeeded in training 2: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), likely due to simple straight-line patterns that horizontal/vertical handled well without needing diagonals.
 * Failed in training 3: Generated filled some 2's horizontally in row 6 columns 4-12 and row 7 column 0-2, but missed the expected diagonal extension of 2's from row 1 column 17 to row 5 column 14 (generated has no 2's there, instead bg 8's); bottom 7's in row 19 not filled at all (expected partial horizontal 7's in row 19 columns 5-7); 4's in column 13 rows 1-5 and 11-14 partially correct but extra 2's in row 2 column 16 misplaced; vertical 2's in column 18 rows 0-4 missing entirely.
 * Succeeded in training 4: Full match (not shown, but reported correct), probably similar to training 2 with contained block extensions.
 * Overall: Iteration loop with re-detection works for cascading fills (e.g., new 2x2 seeds form after initial extensions), but sorting only by row causes top-heavy bias, missing bottom-up propagations; diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful (e.g., apply_diagonal_up_right only goes up-right from (r,k), missing down-right or full anti-diagonal; apply_diagonal_down_left has offset errors like s = (r + 1) + k leading to cc out-of-bounds or wrong positions—do not rely on them without fixes); no handling for color-specific rules (e.g., 6 as temp in training 1? unknown); find_blocks misses overlapping or 1xN seeds, assuming strict 2x2 only.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=0 and extends some vertical/horizontal lines (e.g., 3's in column 5 rows 0-29 filled downward from seeds, 4's in column 12 rows 0-29 similarly; 2's in column 29 rows 2-5 vertical from row 2 seed; 8's in row 7 column 23-25 and row 26-28 columns 23-27 as horizontal blocks). However, it misses key connections: No diagonal fills for the slanted 2's/4's in top-right (e.g., expected 2's shifting left-up from row 2 col 29 to row 0 col 27? generated has isolated 2's without slant); 7's in bottom-right under-filled (e.g., row 26 col 24-25 has 7's but expected full horizontal 7-block in row 27 columns 23-29 and vertical extensions up/down missing; generated has partial 7's in row 27 col 23-28 but stops prematurely at 8's without overwriting boundaries correctly? unknown why not full); 8's in rows 11-13 columns 4-7 form a block but don't extend to connect with test input's partial 8's (e.g., missing horizontal fill left/right); overall, it under-fills diagonals and chained regions (e.g., 3/4 pairs in rows 14-29 columns 5/12 should propagate more interconnectedly, but generated leaves gaps like row 14 col 7-11 as 0's); the output has some overfills like extra 8's in row 7 col 23-25 that may create false seeds, but doesn't match a "completed" puzzle as patterns remain fragmented compared to training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" connected regions starting from detected 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, filling adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until blocked by a different color, effectively completing patterns or shapes in a visual puzzle like a partial nonogram or blob expansion. The process iterates until no more changes occur, with background identified as the most common cell value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is correctly identified as the most frequent value in the flattened grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/4, likely 0 in test).
 * Expansion only triggers from 2x2 blocks of identical non-bg color; skips if block color is 3 (special case, perhaps a "fixed" or non-expandable color).
 * Fills must stop at boundaries: horizontal/vertical expand along rows/columns until hitting non-bg/non-matching color or edge; diagonals follow specific slopes (up-left: rr - (r - k), up-right: s - rr where s = r + (k+1), etc.) and stop similarly.
 * Iterations are bounded (h*w times) to prevent infinite loops, and blocks are sorted by (row, col) for consistent processing order.
 * Subtlety: Expansions can chain (one fill creates new 2x2 blocks for further fills), but the code processes all blocks in one pass before re-scanning, which may miss some chaining if not iterated fully.
 * Diagonal fills are asymmetric and direction-specific: up-left/down-right follow one diagonal slope, up-right/down-left follow the other; they only fill bg cells in the line, not branching.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal/vertical apply to both rows/columns of the 2x2 block simultaneously; diagonals start from the block's position but extend outward only (not inward, as the block is already filled).
 * Color 3 blocks are skipped entirely, preventing over-expansion of certain elements (seen in training 1 where 3's form fixed shapes).
 * Grids may have irregular patterns (e.g., scattered seeds like 2's in test), requiring multiple iterations to propagate fills correctly without overwriting existing non-bg cells.
 * Potential overfill: Code fills only if cell is bg or matches c, but breaks if non-matching non-bg, which is correct but can lead to incomplete fills if blocks overlap incorrectly.
 * No rotation or symmetry assumption; process top-to-bottom, left-to-right via sorting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode, essential for all fills; works in all examples.)

                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return blocks

(This detects seed 2x2 blocks accurately; core to triggering expansions; reliable across examples.)

(Handles row-wise expansion for the two rows of the block; works well for straight lines but note it skips the block itself (k to k+1).)

(Similar to horizontal but column-wise; effective for vertical propagation.)

(The diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are helpful for slope-based fills but have bugs in slope calculations, leading to off-diagonal paths in some cases; retain but fix indexing.)

(The main program loop with deepcopy, sorting blocks by (r,k), and iteration until no change is helpful for convergence, but max_iter = h*w may be too low for complex chaining.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 2 and 4, expanding fills properly for 1's, 9's, 3's, 4's, 6's, and 7's in those cases without overfilling.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated misplaced 1's and 9's in the top half (e.g., row 0 has 1 at col 2 instead of expected empty 8's; bottom rows 20-23 have incorrect 6's positions, like row 20 col 2-6 as 6's but expected has 6's only in specific tapered shape starting row 21), and row 7 col 18 as 4 instead of expected 8; also duplicated 3's blocks without proper diagonal extension, leading to asymmetric fills (unknown why 6's appeared—possibly erroneous bg fill with wrong c).
 * Failed training example 3: Bottom half overfilled 7's into row 19 (full row of 7's but expected has partial 7's only in row 19 cols 5-7 and row 20 partial); top half failed to fill 2's correctly (e.g., row 2 col 18 as 8 instead of 2, row 6 col 13 as 2 but expected 8); 3's in row 13 col 14 as 4 instead of 3, suggesting diagonal functions misaligned or skipped valid blocks.
 * Successful cases (2 and 4) show horizontal/vertical fills work reliably for straight patterns, but diagonals may underperform in asymmetric grids.
 * Skipping c==3 blocks is helpful (prevents fixed shapes from expanding, correct in ex1/3), but may need generalization for other "seed" colors.
 * No extraction functions for full objects/blobs; find_blocks is partial but useful—consider adding a full connected-component finder for post-fill validation.
 * Diagonal functions are broken in slope math (e.g., up-right uses s = r + (k+1), but for block at (r,k)-(r+1,k+1), it may not align with the anti-diagonal; leads to off-path fills in ex1/3); not fully helpful until fixed.
 * Overall, iteration loop converges correctly when directions align, but chaining fails in dense grids (ex1/3), and no handling for overlapping expansions causing color conflicts.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (bg=0 correctly identified; 4's expanded along the main diagonal from rows 0-24 cols 0-24, filling bg to form a thick band; 2's filled horizontally/vertically in scattered positions like row 2 cols 18-19, row 6 col 21-25, and some diagonals; 8's filled a small block in rows 6-9 cols 22-25 and rows 24-27 cols 23-25; 3's in rows 11-12 cols 5-6 unchanged as expected since skipped).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Introduced erroneous 7's in bottom-right (rows 25-28 cols 24-29, forming a partial block, but input has no 7 seeds—possibly spillover from unhandled 2 or 8 expansion); overfilled 2's in row 22 col 29 as 7? (input has 7 there? Wait, input row 22 col 29=7, but generated has 7's spreading incorrectly); diagonal fills for 2's in row 2 col 28 as 2 (but input has 2 there, expected no spread); incomplete 8's in row 10 (only partial, missing vertical down to match input seeds); and row 13 col 4 as 8 but input has 8, yet no further diagonal to connect 3's. Differences suggest diagonal bugs cause misfills (e.g., 7's unknown origin—perhaps bg misdetect or c=7 from nowhere), and iterations didn't propagate 4's fully to connect bottom 7's; test needs more chaining and fixed diagonals to complete shapes without artifacts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 colors act as "seeds" to propagate their color into adjacent background cells along horizontal, vertical, and specific diagonal paths until blocked by non-background cells, iterated until stabilization. The goal is to simulate these expansions correctly to match expected filled patterns, likely representing growing shapes or patterns in a nonogram-like or flood-fill variant with directional constraints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is dynamically identified as the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/2/3/4, 0 in test); propagation only fills cells exactly matching this background value, stopping at any other color (including 3, which acts as a barrier but is not propagated from).
 * Only exact 2x2 blocks of the same color c (where c != background and c != 3) trigger propagation; blocks are found iteratively on the updating grid, and the process loops until no changes occur (with a safety limit like h*w iterations to prevent infinite loops).
 * Horizontal propagation: From a block at (r, k), fill left from column k-1 and right from k+2 on both rows r and r+1, only through background cells.
 * Vertical propagation: Fill up from row r-1 and down from r+2 on both columns k and k+1, only through background.
 * Diagonal propagations are corner-specific and directional: up-right starts adjacent to the block's top-right (from r-1, k+2, moving up-right); up-left from top-left adjacent (r-1, k-1, up-left); down-right from bottom-right (r+2, k+2, down-right); down-left from bottom-left (r+2, k-1, down-left). These are single-directional rays, not full flood-fills, and only fill background.
 * Order matters: Blocks are found and processed in sorted order (by row then column), and all propagations are applied per block before re-finding blocks, which can cause cascading effects; over-propagation happens if diagonals or iterations fill unintended areas.
 * Color 3 is a special barrier: It never seeds blocks and blocks propagation, but existing 3's remain unchanged.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 24x24 in training 1, 20x20 in training 3, ~29x30 in test); empty or single-cell grids return unchanged.
 * Subtle issue: Diagonal starts are from positions *adjacent* to the block's corners (not inside the block), and only if those starting cells are background; propagation stops immediately if the starting cell isn't background.
 * Iterations must re-scan the entire grid each time, as new blocks can form from prior propagations (e.g., a 2x2 might emerge after horizontal fill creates alignment).
 * No overwriting: Only background cells are filled; if a propagation path hits a different color or 3, it stops without filling that cell.
 * Potential overreach: In complex grids, diagonals can create unexpected fills (e.g., chaining across multiple blocks), and the lack of blocking checks mid-diagonal can spill into areas that should remain background.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(These are helpful for straight-line propagations and correctly implement boundary checks and change tracking; essential for core mechanics.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it builds on implied prior ones; horizontal and vertical propagations work well where straight fills are needed (e.g., extending lines in training example 2 and 4, which passed).
 * Diagonal functions (apply_up_right, apply_up_left, apply_down_right, apply_down_left) are partially helpful but over-aggressive: They start from adjacent corner positions without checking if those starts are background or blocked, leading to incorrect fills (e.g., in training 1, they created a wide horizontal strip of 6's in row 21 columns 2-13, but expected has a narrower/more contained 6's pattern with 8's and 9/1 interrupting; in row 22, generated has 3,6,6,3 but expected shifts to include 6,8,9,1).
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated over-filled upper rows with 1's and 9's in inconsistent positions (e.g., row 0 generated [8,8,1,8,...] but expected starts with [8,8,8,8,...] and has 1's/4's shifted right; bottom rows show extra 6's spilling left/right beyond expected containment by 3's and 8's; also, row 20 generated has 8,3,3,3,3,... but expected has 8,3,3,3,3,... matching there, but row 21 diverges with extra 6's).
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated propagated 2's horizontally/vertically too far (e.g., row 7 has long 2's strip to column 19, but expected limits 2's to specific positions like column 18 in row 1; also filled 7's in row 18/19 incorrectly as full strips, while expected has contained 7's in row 19 columns 5-7 and row 20 partial).
 * Training examples 2 and 4 (CORRECT) suggest the core loop and block-finding work for simpler cases without heavy diagonal interference, but the attempt fails on complex interactions.
 * The main program loop is helpful for iteration but breaks early if no blocks (good), yet in practice, it processes all diagonals per block without prioritizing, causing chains (e.g., a vertical fill might create a new block that diagonals exploit incorrectly).
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (like blobs or shapes) are present or needed; the block-based approach is direct but misses that propagations might need to respect existing structures (e.g., 3's as hard stops).
 * Diagonal functions are not fully broken but unhelpful in current form due to lack of starting-cell checks (e.g., if the adjacent corner cell is already colored, no diagonal should start); suggest modifying to check new_g[starting_r][starting_c] == bg before the while loop.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies 0 as background and propagates 4's diagonally in the top-left (e.g., creating a diagonal stair of 4's from row 0 col 1 to row 24 col 29-ish), and fills some 2's and 8's in mid-grid (e.g., row 7-9 has 8,2,2,8 blocks extended), but over-fills 7's in bottom-right (e.g., row 26 has long 7's from col 24-29, and row 27 spills 7's horizontally, which seems excessive without visible 2x2 seeds justifying it—mentally simulating, input has isolated 7's at bottom, no clear 2x2 for 7, so propagation shouldn't start; expected likely contains 7's more tightly around input positions like row 22 col 29).
 * Extra 8's in row 10-13 (e.g., row 11 has 8,3,3,8 extended to 8,4,4,8 but with fills around) look like vertical propagation from an 8 block, but input shows sparse 8's, so this might chain incorrectly from diagonals.
 * 3's in row 11-12 remain unchanged (correct, as barriers), but nearby 4's don't propagate through them properly (e.g., row 13 has 8,0,8,0 but output fills some 0's to 4's adjacent, which might be right if from a block, but test grid has no 2x2 4 there initially—suggests iteration created new blocks).
 * 2's in top-right (e.g., row 2 col 18-19) extend vertically/horizontally correctly to form lines, but diagonal up-left from them might incorrectly fill unrelated 0's in row 0-1.
 * Overall, output has too much filling in bottom (7's and 8's spilling into large areas), which doesn't match a mental run: Input has small 7 cluster at bottom-right without 2x2, so no propagation; top 4's and 2's should form contained diagonals/stairs without crossing the central 8/3 area. This indicates diagonals or iteration order is causing unintended cascades.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving pattern recognition and propagation, where the goal is to fill "fillable" cells (background color or a special filler like 8) based on detected 2x2 "seed" blocks of the same non-background, non-3 color, extending fills horizontally, vertically, and possibly diagonally without overwriting non-fillable cells, iterating until stable. The rules aim to complete symmetric or structured patterns (e.g., shapes, lines, or blobs) while preserving fixed elements like 3's (which seem to act as barriers) and avoiding overfilling or introducing invalid colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most common cell value; fillable cells are bg plus 8 (if present and != bg), but fills propagate a seed's color (c) into these without changing non-fillable cells (e.g., 3's block everything, other colors may not).
 * 2x2 seeds are detected only if all four cells match c (where c != 3 and c not in fillable); seeds must be sorted by position for consistent processing.
 * Fills happen in passes: horizontal (extend left/right from seed columns in seed rows ±1), vertical (extend up/down from seed rows in seed columns ±1), and diagonals (extend along lines from seed corners), but only into consecutive fillable cells; no wrapping or crossing barriers.
 * Iteration continues until no changes or max iterations (to prevent infinite loops), but must use a temp grid to avoid mid-pass overwrites affecting later seeds.
 * Subtle: 3's are absolute barriers (no fill into or through them); diagonals are tricky—up-left/down-right use one slope (rr - cc constant), up-right/down-left use the other (rr + cc constant)—but implementations often miscalculate offsets, leading to off-grid or wrong-line fills.
 * Patterns often involve symmetry (e.g., mirrored shapes, borders), and overfilling happens if diagonals or extensions ignore boundaries; 8 may be a temporary filler that gets overwritten.
 * Easy to miss: Seeds can be created dynamically during iteration (new 2x2's from prior fills trigger more), but only process existing seeds per pass; avoid filling into areas that would create invalid new seeds; some colors (e.g., 6 in ex1, 2 in ex3) should form specific blobs/lines, not flood entire regions.
 * All attempts must handle variable grid sizes, empty grids (return as-is), and ensure output matches exact expected patterns without extra changes.
 * Considerations from attempts: Horizontal/vertical work well for straight lines but fail on curves/angles; diagonals are often broken (wrong starting points or slopes); no handling for multi-seed interactions or priority (e.g., process top-left first); max_iter = h*w prevents loops but may stop early; 8's role as fillable but overridable is key, but code sometimes treats it as permanent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color using Counter; essential for fillable set and is reliable across examples.)

```python
def get_fillable(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.Set[int]:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    counter = Counter(flat)
    fillable = {bg}
    if 8 in counter and 8 != bg:
        fillable.add(8)
    return fillable
```
(Helpful for defining what can be overwritten; captures the special role of 8 as a temporary/secondary fillable, but note: in iteration, new fills use seed c, so fillable is checked dynamically.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], fillable: tp.Set[int]) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != 3 and c not in fillable and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(Core detection of 2x2 seeds; works well for identifying propagation starters, sorts for consistency; essential but misses dynamic seeds if not re-found each iter.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, fillable: tp.Set[int], w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        if 0 <= rr < len(g):
            # left
            cc = k - 1
            while cc >= 0 and g[rr][cc] in fillable:
                g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
                cc -= 1
            # right
            cc = k + 2
            while cc < w and g[rr][cc] in fillable:
                g[rr][cc] = c
                changed = True
                cc += 1
    return changed
```
(Helpful for row-wise extensions; correctly skips the seed itself and barriers; works in ex2/4 but needs pairing with vertical for full lines.)

```python
def apply_vertical(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, fillable: tp.Set[int], h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0 and g[rr][col] in fillable:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h and g[rr][col] in fillable:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr += 1
    return changed
```
(Similar to horizontal; good for column fills, essential for vertical patterns in ex3; reliable if diagonals are fixed separately.)

(The four diagonal functions—apply_diagonal_up_left, apply_diagonal_up_right, apply_diagonal_down_left, apply_diagonal_down_right—are broken or unhelpful: they use incorrect slope calculations (e.g., s = r - k for up-left often goes off-line; up-right uses r + k +1 which misaligns; down functions start at r+2 but wrong offsets like s = (r+1) - (k+1) fail to follow diagonals properly). They cause overfills or misses in ex1/ex3 (e.g., wrong positions filled with 6's or 2's); do not use in future—redesign with proper diagonal traversal (e.g., loop along rr ±1, cc ±1 matching slope).)

(The main program loop is helpful for iteration and temp grid usage to avoid race conditions, but max_iter = h*w is arbitrary and may truncate; sorting blocks ensures order but doesn't handle seed dependencies well.)

 * Training ex1 INCORRECT: Generated overfilled bottom with 6's (e.g., row20 has full 6's row, but expected has sparse 6's in columns 2-5,8; row21 has 6's in col8 but expected none); top rows have misplaced 1's/9's (e.g., row0 col16=9 but expected 8; row20 col2-5=3's correct but 6's wrong); differences suggest diagonal bugs created false extensions, and horizontal/vertical overpropagated without stopping at 3's/edges; unknown why 6's flooded instead of forming small blob.
 * Training ex2 CORRECT: All fills matched (e.g., proper line extensions from seeds); horizontal/vertical worked perfectly, no overfill.
 * Training ex3 INCORRECT: Generated filled upper areas with 2's where expected 8's (e.g., rows0-4 all 8's expected but generated has 2's leaking up? Wait, generated rows0-5 are 8's but row6 has 3's and 8's correct, but row7 has long 2's row where expected shorter 2's in cols0-6; bottom row19 has 3,7,7,3 but expected 3,7,7,3—no, row18 has 7's blob but generated row7 has extra 2's extending right; row13 has 3,3,3,4 but expected 3,3,3,8; differences: vertical fills from 2-seed in row7 overextended rightward into non-fillable? And missed filling 2's in sparse positions like row0 col18=2 expected but generated 8.
 * Training ex4 CORRECT: Matched exactly, likely simple seeds with clean h/v fills.
 * Overall: Horizontal/vertical functions are solid for straight propagations but insufficient alone (need better diagonals for angles); iteration finds new seeds but processes all at once via temp, causing order issues; find_blocks misses if seeds overlap or are created mid-iter without refind; no extraction of "objects" (e.g., blobs) attempted, but could help validate shapes; unhelpful: diagonal functions consistently wrong, leading to 50% failure rate.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It starts with uniform 2's in top 9 rows (plausible if 2 is bg), but then introduces irregular 4's in a near-checkerboard pattern from row9 onward (e.g., row9 has 4's at cols9,11-12,14; row10 has 4's block but interrupted), escalating to dense 4's and 7's in lower rows, and unexpectedly adds 0's (e.g., row27 col22=0, row28 col21=0, row29 col20=0,22=0)—0's are likely invalid (not in input colors, suggests bug like off-grid access or uninitialized fill). This doesn't match puzzle logic: fills should propagate cleanly from 2x2 seeds (visible 3's/4's/7's suggest seeds there), forming structured shapes (e.g., borders or blobs like in training), not chaotic checkerboard or introducing new colors; overfilling with 4's/7's ignores barriers (e.g., 3's in row11-12 should block), and 0's indicate index errors in extensions; expected likely has sparse, symmetric fills (e.g., extending 4's into 2's bg without 0's or checker patterns)—test fails due to broken diagonals creating false propagations and no bounds checks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to iteratively expand or "grow" specific 2x2 seed blocks of uniform color (excluding background and a special value 3) by filling adjacent background cells in defined directions (horizontal extensions, upward vertical, and diagonal lines up-left/up-right/down-left/down-right), simulating a flooding or pattern completion process until no more changes occur, while preserving non-background elements like 3's and other fixed colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined as the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all expansions only overwrite bg cells, never other colors or 3's (which act as barriers or fixed elements that block growth).
 * Seed blocks are strictly 2x2 squares of the same non-bg, non-3 color; they must be detected in every iteration, and expansions happen from each detected block in a loop until no changes.
 * Expansions are directional and asymmetric: horizontal fills extend left/right from the block's columns in both rows (skipping the block itself); vertical only goes upward (not downward); diagonals are line-based from the block's top-left corner, filling bg cells along the diagonal ray until hitting a non-bg or edge—up-left/up-right from above the block, down-left/down-right from below.
 * Iterations continue until no more bg cells are filled (with a safety limit to prevent infinite loops); order of processing blocks matters (sorted by row/col), and changes can create new 2x2 blocks for further growth.
 * 3's are special: they prevent block detection over them and block all fills, but may be part of expected patterns without being grown into.
 * Grids can have varying colors (e.g., 0 as bg, seeds like 4/2/6/7/8); growth uses the seed's color (c) to fill.
 * Subtle: Diagonal calculations rely on precise slope equations (e.g., up-left uses rr - s where s = r - k); fills only happen if the target is bg and in bounds; horizontal/vertical are row/col-aligned, but diagonals are strict 45-degree lines.
 * Overfilling or underfilling happens if directions miss cases (e.g., no downward vertical), or if iterations don't propagate correctly (e.g., new blocks not re-detected promptly).
 * Grids may have pre-filled non-bg areas (e.g., 8's as partial shapes) that interact with growth, and expected outputs often show completed symmetric or patterned fills (e.g., lines, blobs, or shapes like numbers/letters).
 * All attempts must handle deepcopy to avoid mutating input; max iterations prevent hangs on large grids (e.g., h*w).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the mode, essential for all expansions.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This accurately detects and sorts 2x2 seeds, crucial for iterative growth; excludes 3 properly.)

```python
def apply_horizontal(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, w: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for rr in [r, r + 1]:
        cc = k - 1
        while cc >= 0 and g[rr][cc] == bg:
            g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
            cc -= 1
        cc = k + 2
        while cc < w and g[rr][cc] == bg:
            g[rr][cc] = c
            changed = True
            cc += 1
    return changed
```
(This handles left/right extensions in the two block rows correctly, skipping the block itself.)

```python
def apply_vertical_up(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for col in [k, k + 1]:
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0 and g[rr][col] == bg:
            g[rr][col] = c
            changed = True
            rr -= 1
    return changed
```
(This fills upward in the two block columns; note asymmetry—no downward vertical.)

The diagonal apply functions (apply_up_left, apply_up_right, apply_down_left, apply_down_right) are mostly helpful but have bugs in slope calculations (e.g., apply_up_left uses s = r - k but iterates rr decreasing with cc = rr - s, which works for some but fails on offsets; similar issues in down functions lead to incorrect rays).

The main program loop is helpful for iteration but over-applies in one pass per block without re-scanning mid-iteration, causing incomplete propagation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) succeeded on training examples 2 and 4 (exact match to expected, indicating correct handling of some seed expansions and iterations) but failed on 1 and 3.
 * Train 1: Generated overfilled bottom area with 6's in irregular shapes (e.g., row 20 has [8, 3, 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,...] vs expected [8, 3,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,9,1,...] with cleaner lines and 8's interrupting; row 21 has 3-8 transition wrong; row 22 has extra 6's; row 23 has missing 6's and wrong positions—likely due to diagonal miscalculations creating new unintended blocks or overextending horizontals).
 * Train 3: Generated mismatched fills, e.g., row 13 has [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,...] vs expected [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,...] (extra 4's and missing 8); row 18 has 3's but expected cleaner; bottom rows have 7's filled downward incorrectly (e.g., row 19 has 7's extending right vs expected limited; unknown why vertical-up only didn't propagate 2's/4's properly to match expected positions like row 0 col 18=2).
 * extract_objects not present, but find_blocks serves similar purpose for seeds.
 * Diagonal functions are broken/not fully helpful: e.g., apply_down_right's s = (r + 1) - (k + 1) and cc = rr - s often misaligns rays, leading to skipped or wrong fills (seen in train 1's 6-blob errors); don't rely on them without fixing slopes.
 * Horizontal and vertical_up are helpful and correct, as evidenced by partial matches in trains 1/3 (e.g., some lines filled right).
 * Iteration loop is essential but insufficient: processes all blocks per iter without immediate re-detection, missing chained growth (e.g., new 2x2 from partial fills not triggering until next iter, causing underfill in test/large grids).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond buggy diagonals; get_background and deepcopy are solid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it underfills massively, leaving most of the grid as 0's (bg) despite clear 2x2-ish seeds of 4's along the diagonal (rows 0-9, cols 0-9) and scattered 2's/3's/8's that should trigger growth; e.g., top-left 4's barely expand (only minor 8's in bottom-right row 25-27, and partial 7's in row 26), but expected should show full diagonal lines or blobs of 4's extending horizontally/up/diagonally, plus 2's growing into shapes, and 8's/7's completing patterns without overwriting 3's.
 * Differences: Row 0 has [4,0,0,...2,0,...4,0,...] with no fills vs expected likely full horizontal/diagonal 4-lines from seeds; row 10 has partial 8's/4's but no propagation to fill surrounding 0's upward/downward; bottom has isolated 7's/8's (e.g., row 26 [0,0,...8,7,7,7,7,7,7]) that seem overextended downward without matching any seed, suggesting diagonal bugs created phantom growth; overall, output looks sparse/incomplete (e.g., no 4-blob in center, 2's not expanded), failing to "complete" the visual puzzle into coherent shapes—likely due to iteration not converging fully or missed directions for this larger/varied grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block detection and expansion, where 2x2 seeds of the same non-background, non-special (3) color trigger filling of adjacent background cells in straight (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal directions until hitting obstacles or edges, simulating growth or flood-fill mechanics to complete patterns like shapes, lines, or borders. The process iterates until no more expansions occur, with background determined by the most common cell value, and special rules for handling extensions from endpoints.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent value (e.g., 8 in examples); all expansions only fill bg cells and stop at non-bg/non-matching-color cells, including color 3 which acts as a blocker and is excluded from seed detection.
 * Seeds are strictly 2x2 blocks of identical color c (not bg or 3); they must be detected in a loop until the grid stabilizes, processing blocks in row-column order.
 * Expansions include: full horizontal lines left/right from the 2x2 (filling bg in both rows of the block, with special downward diagonal extensions from the last filled point if blocked); vertical lines up/down from both columns; and four diagonal directions (up-right, down-left, up-left, down-right) filling bg along the line.
 * Subtle: Horizontal expansions have asymmetric endpoint handling—leftward stops and potentially extends down-left from the last bg filled, rightward extends down-right; vertical and diagonal are symmetric but stop immediately at any non-bg/non-c.
 * Color 3 is "solid" or immovable—never expands from it, and it blocks all fills; other colors (e.g., 1,2,4,6,7,9) can be seeds if forming 2x2 and expand into bg only.
 * Grid can have irregular widths/heights, but examples are rectangular; iterations must use deepcopy to compare changes, avoiding infinite loops.
 * Patterns often form borders, diagonals, or enclosed shapes (e.g., 6's forming a blob in train1, 2's diagonal in train3); over-filling or missing extensions leads to scattered/incorrect placements.
 * Easy to miss: Diagonals use sum/difference coordinates (e.g., r+k constant for one diag, r-k for the other); horizontal extensions only affect the two rows of the seed, not full grid height; no wrapping around edges.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy

def get_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies bg as most common value; useful for all grids.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    if h < 2:
        return blocks
    w = len(g[0])
    if w < 2:
        return blocks
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This accurately detects 2x2 seeds excluding bg/3, sorts by position for consistent processing; essential for triggering expansions.)

```python
def apply_vertical(temp_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int):
    for col in (k, k + 1):
        # up
        rr = r - 1
        while rr >= 0:
            if temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][col] = c
            elif temp_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr -= 1
        # down
        rr = r + 2
        while rr < h:
            if temp_g[rr][col] == bg:
                temp_g[rr][col] = c
            elif temp_g[rr][col] != c:
                break
            rr += 1
```
(This handles vertical fills correctly from the two seed columns, skipping the seed rows themselves; helpful for line patterns.)

```python
def apply_diag_up_right(temp_g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], r: int, k: int, c: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int):
    s = r + k + 1
    rr = r - 1
    while rr >= 0:
        cc = s - rr
        if cc < 0 or cc >= w:
            break
        if temp_g[rr][cc] == bg:
            temp_g[rr][cc] = c
        elif temp_g[rr][cc] != c:
            break
        rr -= 1
```
(Example of diagonal fill using sum coordinate; similar for other diags—useful, but must ensure correct starting points beyond seed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated scattered horizontal 1's in top rows (e.g., row0: 8's with 1's at positions 2,23; row6: misplaced 4's and 1's) instead of expected vertical/diagonal stack of repeating 9-1 pairs (e.g., column9-10 has 9,1 vertically across rows); bottom 6's form incorrect partial lines (e.g., row20 has 6's from col2-5,13 but expected has structured shape with 6's in col9-10 shifting); 3's and 4's partially match but overfilled (unknown reason for 6's misalignment, possibly horizontal over-extension).
 * Train2 correct: All expansions matched expected, indicating core loop and vertical/diagonal logic works for simple cases.
 * Train3 incorrect: Generated extra 2's in bottom-left (e.g., row7 col0-6 all 2's, but expected has only partial); 7's overfilled horizontally in row19 (full row0-7=7, but expected limits to col0-7); vertical 4's and 3's mostly match but 2's diagonal incomplete (e.g., missing 2's in rows0-4 col18-19); 3's in row13 col11-13 filled as 3,3,3 but expected has 3,3,3,8 (wait, generated has 3,3,3,4—mismatch at end, possibly diag overfill).
 * Train4 correct: Handled complex interactions (e.g., multiple colors, blockers) without overfill, showing horizontal+down-diag from points works in some scenarios.
 * Overall: Iteration loop stabilizes correctly (no infinite), but horizontal apply_left/right often overfills or misplaces endpoints (e.g., last_filled extensions trigger unintended down-diags); diag functions skip seed cells properly but may start from wrong offset; excluding 3 from seeds is good, but 3 blocks all directions subtly (e.g., train1 3's frame 4's/6's without expanding into them).
 * Function apply_horizontal (and sub-left/right) is broken/not fully helpful: Complex endpoint logic leads to incorrect down-left/right triggers (e.g., fills bg beyond blockers in train1/3); simplify or debug last_filled conditions.
 * apply_diag_down_left/up_right etc. are helpful but subtle coord errors (e.g., s = r + k +1 starts after seed, but may clip edges wrong in train3).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It shows scattered 4's along a near-diagonal in top-left (rows0-10 cols0-10), 2's in irregular positions (e.g., row2 col19=2, row3 col20=2, but sparse and not forming clean lines), 3's only in rows11-12 cols5-6/10-13 (limited, possibly under-expanded), 8's as apparent secondary bg or blocker in mid-right (rows7-10 cols22-25), and 7's overfilled in bottom-right (row26 cols24-29 all 7's, row27 cols24-25/27-29=7 but irregular). Expected likely forms structured patterns like bordered shapes or diagonals (e.g., 4's completing a frame, 2's as a clean diag line, 7's contained without spillover, using 0 as bg), but generated has fragmented fills and no clear enclosure—suggests horizontal/diagonal over/under-extension, especially around 8's/3's as blockers.
 * Missing cohesive shapes: Top 4's don't connect into expected vertical/diagonal borders (e.g., row10 col5-9=8's interrupt); bottom 7's spill horizontally beyond probable 8-blockers (row25 col23-29), unlike contained 7's in train3 expected.
 * 3's underfilled: Only two small blocks, but test input has potential for more expansion around rows11-14 cols4-14; unknown if 8's are treated as bg (misidentified?) or blockers.
 * Makes sense partially for seed detection (e.g., potential 2x2 4's trigger top fills), but overall fragmented—update horizontal endpoint logic and ensure diags respect all blockers to handle test's wider grid (30 cols) and mixed 0/8/3.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:16:14] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to expand or "grow" distinct colored regions (represented by numbers like 1,2,3,4,6,7,9) from seed patterns, such as 2x2 blocks of the same non-background color, into adjacent background cells (e.g., 8 or 0) along straight lines (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions), while respecting boundaries like other colors or special markers (e.g., 3 as a potential blocker). The process is iterative, continuing until no more expansions are possible, resulting in filled shapes that match expected patterns without overfilling or incorrectly merging regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most common cell value (e.g., 8 in training examples 1/3/4, 0 in test); expansions only fill into background cells, stopping at non-background or differing colors.
 * Seed detection focuses on 2x2 blocks of identical non-background, non-3 colors; 3 seems to act as a blocker or unexpandable element (code explicitly skips c == 3).
 * Expansions occur in four main directions per seed: horizontal (both rows of the 2x2), vertical (both columns), and diagonals (from corners, extending outward); filling is line-based (ray-casting from the seed edges) and only into background, but must not cross non-matching colors.
 * Iterations continue in a loop until no changes; however, simultaneous multi-block processing in one pass can cause unintended overlaps or early stops if not handled carefully (e.g., using a temp grid).
 * Subtlety: Diagonal expansions start from positions adjacent to the 2x2 (e.g., r-1,k-1) and proceed in diagonal steps; this can miss or overfill if directions aren't precisely offset.
 * 3 often appears in seeds or barriers but isn't expanded; in example 1, 3-regions expand into 6's incorrectly, suggesting 3 might seed different behaviors or block specific paths.
 * Grids have varying sizes (24x24 in ex1, 20x20 in ex3, ~30x30 in test); ensure code handles empty/edge cases without errors.
 * Over-expansion issue: In ex1, bottom 6's fill horizontally/vertically but ignore expected vertical stacking with 1/4; in ex3, 2's fill prematurely without respecting 3-blockers.
 * Merging: Regions of the same color can merge if expansions connect them, but code's per-block processing might not propagate correctly across iterations.
 * Special colors like 4/7/2 in test seem to expand similarly, but test has irregular placements (e.g., 8's as partial barriers?); ensure diagonals don't skip over 3's.
 * Sorting blocks by position (r,k) ensures consistent order, but may affect iteration if dependencies exist (e.g., one block's fill enables another's seed).
 * Potential miss: Expansions should not fill into other seeds or partial regions; code checks cell != c to stop, but may fill bg adjacent to non-c incorrectly if not strict.
 * In ex3, vertical 2's in row7 col0-2 are filled but expected lacks them in upper areas; suggests over-expansion vertically from lower seeds.
 * Test grid has sparse seeds (e.g., diagonal 4's top-left, clustered 2's mid-right, 3's in col4-5 row11-12, 7's bottom-right); expansions should form shapes like lines or blobs without crossing 8's or 0's improperly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This accurately identifies bg as most common value; useful across all examples.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    blocks = []
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    for r in range(h - 1):
        for k in range(w - 1):
            c = g[r][k]
            if c != bg and c != 3 and g[r][k + 1] == c and g[r + 1][k] == c and g[r + 1][k + 1] == c:
                blocks.append((r, k, c))
    return sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(This detects 2x2 seeds correctly, skipping 3 and bg; sorting helps reproducibility; essential for identifying expansion starts.)

(The main program loop uses temp grid for simultaneous updates, which prevents mid-iteration interference; helpful for convergence.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated over-expands 1's and 9's into incorrect positions (e.g., row0 col16=9 expected 8; row20 has 6's filling horizontally across cols2-14, but expected has vertical 6's only in cols8-9 rows20-23 with 1/4 integration); bottom 3-regions expand to 6's incorrectly, missing expected 6-blob shape aligned under 9/1; 4's in row6-8 col18 are correct, but overall mismatches in 1/4 placements (e.g., row20 col21=1 expected, but surrounding 8's wrong).
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT): All expansions match expected, suggesting the core 2x2 detection and line-filling works for simpler or non-overlapping seeds.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT): Generated fills extra 2's in upper areas (e.g., row2 col18=8 expected but generated has 2-propagation? Wait, generated row7 col0-6=2's but expected row7 col0-5=2's with col6=3; row13 col14=4 expected but generated has 3's overexpanding vertically into row13 col12-14=3,3,4 vs expected 3,3,8; lower 7's in row18-19 not filled at all, and row8 col0=2 vs expected 2 but propagation stops wrong at 3-blockers).
 * Training example 4 (CORRECT): Handles complex interactions (e.g., 4/3/2 regions) without overfill, indicating vertical/horizontal works when no diagonals interfere.
 * General issue: Diagonal expansions overreach (e.g., in ex1, diag from bottom 3-seeds may cause 6's to skip into wrong areas; unknown why but leads to mismatched blob shapes).
 * Iteration loop breaks too early if no changed in one pass, but multi-block overlaps cause incomplete fills (e.g., ex3 misses 2's in rows0-4 col18).
 * Function for diagonal starts [(r-1,k-1,-1,-1), etc.] is helpful but buggy—starts from outside seed, may fill pre-seed bg incorrectly if not bounded.
 * No extraction of full objects/blobs; current find_blocks only seeds, but post-expansion analysis needed for verification (not implemented, could help debug shapes).
 * Unhelpful: No function to validate final grid against rules (e.g., no-adjacent non-bg fills); the temp grid update is good but changed flag misses if blocks enable new seeds in same iter.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., top-left 4's expand diagonally into a sparse line pattern matching seed positions; mid-right 2's form a small cluster around row6-9 col22-25 with 8's as partial bg; bottom 7's expand horizontally in row26-27 cols24-29 into a bar, and vertically down; 3's in row11-12 col5-6 stay contained without overfill). However, it does not look fully correct: 8's in row10 col5-7 and row13 col5/7 appear as incomplete barriers but get partially filled by nearby 4's (e.g., row10 col10=4 expands left into row10 col5=8? but generated keeps some 0's); lower 7's overexpand left into row25-29 col23=8's turning to 7's, but expected likely keeps 8's as distinct (unknown, but irregular 8-clusters suggest they are not pure bg); 2's in row2 col29 and row3 col21 don't propagate fully upward, leaving isolated 0's that should connect via diags; overall, too many residual 0's in mid-grid (e.g., row14-20 cols0-20 all 0's except sparse 4's), suggesting missed vertical/diagonal rays from upper seeds—update by adding more iteration passes or better seed re-detection after fills.
