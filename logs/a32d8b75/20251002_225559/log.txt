=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 22:56:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 23:19:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where the left portion of each row (likely columns 0-5) encodes a pattern or rule that must be extracted and applied as an overlay or transformation to the cropped main content area (likely columns 6-29, producing 24 elements per row). The goal is to generate a modified output grid that matches expected transformations, involving header normalizations, pattern cycling for empty rows, and periodic overlays, but the current approach misapplies these rules leading to mismatches in pattern propagation, header extensions, and overlay positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 columns, ignoring or framing with specific values like 0,6,7; leading frames determine repetition, and non-zero values after form the core pattern, but this fails when patterns shift or cycle incorrectly across consecutive empty rows.
 * Header normalization extends initial runs of 5's to exactly 3 cells and 3's to 6 cells by overwriting subsequent cells, but this is applied universally without checking row context, leading to over-extension or incorrect starts (e.g., turning partial 5's into full 3's prematurely).
 * Overlays apply a 3-element pattern (padded/repeated if short, with 1's mapped to 4's) starting at index 9 of the crop, repeating every 6 positions for the first 3 slots of each block, but this ignores varying block structures, deeper pattern rotations (e.g., [1:] + [0] for cycles), and doesn't handle cases where patterns evolve mid-grid or interact with existing content like 8's or 9's.
 * Consecutive empty patterns (no non-frame values in left) carry the previous pattern but cycle it (e.g., rotate left by 1), resetting counter on new patterns; however, the cycle logic only triggers after >1 empty, which misses single-empty carries and fails on long sequences.
 * Crop is always row[6:30] (24 elements), assuming fixed width; outputs must preserve this length without introducing 0's unless they are part of the expected transformation.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may need to be derived from cumulative or row-spanning logic (e.g., vertical alignment across rows), 1's specifically map to 4's in overlays but not elsewhere, and certain values like 8's or 9's act as backgrounds that overlays replace selectively; empty lefts don't always cycle but may default to all-5 or all-3 headers.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show progressive shifts (e.g., 5's shrinking, 3's expanding, overlays inserting 4/7/8 blocks), suggesting rules tied to row index or global progression, not just per-row left extraction.
 * Avoid universal normalization—some rows in expected have irregular headers (e.g., single 5's or mixed 3/8 without extension); overlays may start earlier/later or apply to different strides based on pattern length.
 * 0's in left indicate frames/empties but should not propagate to output crops unless expected; test inputs have 0's in crops, which generated outputs retain incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract pattern from left 5 columns based on leading frame colors (0,6,7)."""
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    leading = 0
    i = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []  # Empty pattern
    first = left[i]
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function partially works for identifying leading repeats but fails on complex lefts with mixed non-frames; useful as a starting point for extraction but needs refinement for cycling.)

```python
def normalize_header(crop: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extend initial runs of 5 and 3 to 3 and 6 respectively by overwriting next cells."""
    crop = crop[:]  # Copy
    # Extend 5's to 3
    num5 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 5
    # Re-find and extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(crop) and crop[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    num3 = 0
    i = start3
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 3
    return crop
```
(This is broken for rows without initial 5/3 runs, as it forces extensions where expected outputs have different starts like 8's or 4's; not helpful without conditional application based on left pattern.)

```python
def apply_overlay(crop: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Apply pattern overlay starting from position 9, every 6 positions, replacing first 3."""
    p = pattern[:]
    while len(p) < 3 and p:
        p.append(p[-1])

    return result
```
(This overlays too rigidly at fixed starts/stride, ignoring expected variations like shifting to positions 0-8 or different repeats; unhelpful for dynamic patterns, e.g., rotating 7/8 blocks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the crop as row[6:30] and handles basic pattern extraction from left, with consecutive empty logic attempting carry-over, but fails overall as all training examples are incorrect.
 * For Training 1: Rows 0-1 match expected headers exactly ([5x5 + 3x22 +5x2] and [5x4 +3x20]), but row 2 mismatches from pos 9-11 (generated 4,4,4 vs expected 3,3,3) and pos 18-20 (3,3,3 vs 4,4,4), showing overlay wrongly inserts 4's where 3's should persist; row 4 mismatches pos 10 (7 vs nothing, expected has 4,7,4 but generated shifts); row 5 major mismatch (generated 4,7,4,8x3 vs expected 5,5,3x5,8x2 + all 4's), indicating failed header shrink and wrong overlay cycle; later rows like 8-12 insert 1's/4's incorrectly where expected has 8's/3's evolving vertically; row 17 has 6's where expected has 3's/8's, suggesting pattern misderivation from left.
 * For Training 2: Almost no matches—row 0 generated [5x3,3x6,9,8x5,9x4,8x4] vs expected [2x2,1,8x2,9,2x2,1,9,8x5,9x4,8x4], wrong headers and overlays (9/8 blocks overwritten incorrectly); row 1 has 4's/2's where expected has 2's/9's, showing 1->4 map applied wrongly and pattern [4,4,2] not matching expected [2,2,2]; repetitive 4/8/9 blocks in rows 5-12 ignore expected cycling of 1/2 patterns; row 13 introduces 6's mismatched to expected 2's, indicating broken cycling for empties.
 * For Training 3: Row 0 all 5's matches, but row 1 generated [5x9,3x3,5x3,3x3,5x3,3x3] vs expected [5x15,3,8,3x2,8,3x2,8,3], wrong extension of 3's and missing 8 insertions; row 2 has 8,3,8 repeats where expected has 3,8x2,3 etc., close but shifted; rows 5-9 mismatch overlays (e.g., row 5 generated 3x6 +8,4x3 etc. vs expected 4x15,3,8x2,4x3,3,8x2), failing to propagate 4's fully; rows 15-19 repetitive 4/6 but expected all 4's, showing over-application of patterns.
 * get_pattern is somewhat helpful for simple lefts but broken for frames with embedded non-zeros or when leading != repeat count.
 * normalize_header is not helpful—overwrites too aggressively, causing header mismatches in all examples where expected has non-extended or alternative starts (e.g., direct 8's in train3).
 * apply_overlay is incorrect—fixed range(9,24,6) misses early overlays (e.g., pos 0 in some expected) and doesn't rotate patterns per row, leading to static repeats; don't use without dynamic start/stride.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of cropping and left extraction but misses vertical/global pattern evolution, conditional normalization, and flexible overlays; consecutive_empty >1 for cycling is too strict, as some expected carries happen on first empty.
 * No functions for vertical alignment or cumulative patterns, which seems essential given row-to-row progressions in expected (e.g., shrinking 5's, expanding 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it retains many 0's from the input crop (e.g., row 0 pos 9-11=0,0,9... but ends with 6,0x4, introducing artifacts not in training expecteds, which avoid 0's in structured blocks), suggesting failed overwriting or pattern application leaves empties untouched.
 * Headers are mostly [5x3,3x6] which may be right for some rows, but overlays insert inconsistent 4/6/3/9 blocks (e.g., row 1: 4,4,6,9x3,4,4,6,9,6,0,4,4,6 with lingering 0's and mismatched 6's where patterns cycle wrongly); row 4 has 3,6,4 repeats but expected likely needs full 9/6 propagation without 0's.
 * Later rows like 13-17 have 0's in pos 12-14/18 (e.g., 3,6,4,0x3,3,6,4,0,6,0,3,6,4), which looks like incomplete overlays or failed normalization, not matching clean block structures in training expecteds (e.g., no 0's, full 3/4/8/9 fills).
 * Row 26 has [5x3,3x6,4x3,9x3,4x3,4,9,6,0,4x3] with 0's and partial 6's, indicating the cycling/overlay logic breaks on long sequences, producing messy outputs unlike expected uniform transformations.
 * Overall, test output makes no sense as a solved puzzle—too many 0's and irregularities suggest the program doesn't fully transform the crop, missing core rules like complete replacement or background filling.

[2025-10-02 23:19:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

```python
from typing import List

def crop_left_border(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Rule: Remove the left border consisting of the first 6 columns (indices 0-5),
    which contain the frame (6's) and margin patterns. The interior content starts
    at index 6 and goes to the end (index 29 for 30-column inputs), resulting in
    24 columns per row. This extracts the main puzzle image from the bordered input.
    Applicable to all examples as the main content is consistently positioned after
    the left border.

[2025-10-02 23:33:56] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def crop_left_border(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Rule: Remove the left border consisting of the first 6 columns (indices 0-5),
    which contain the frame (6's) and margin patterns. The interior content starts
    at index 6 and goes to the end (index 29 for 30-column inputs), resulting in
    24 columns per row. This extracts the main puzzle image from the bordered input.
    Applicable to all examples as the main content is consistently positioned after
    the left border.
    """
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return crop_left_border(g)
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 23:34:37] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors, patterns, or elements in a bordered frame, and the task is to process the input grid to output a cleaned or transformed version of the interior puzzle content, preserving the overall structure but correctly interpreting or extracting the main visual elements while removing framing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * All inputs appear to have a consistent left border (first 6 columns) consisting of frame elements like 6's or other consistent values that frame the puzzle, which must be cropped to access the 24-column interior; however, simply cropping without further processing leaves the interior numbers unchanged, which does not match expectations.
 * Interiors contain patterns of numbers (e.g., 3's, 8's, 4's, 7's, 1's, 9's, 0's) that likely represent shapes, objects, or encoded visuals; expected outputs show transformations or replacements in these areas (e.g., blocks of 8's become mixed 4's/7's in train 1, uniform 9's become patterned 1's/2's in train 2), suggesting rules for decoding, filling, or recognizing connected components/blobs rather than literal copying.
 * Top and bottom rows often retain border-like values (e.g., 5's in train 1 and 3), indicating that horizontal borders may be part of the output or need selective preservation, while vertical frames (left/right) are fully removed; right borders (e.g., 6's in test) may also need cropping or handling.
 * Subtle patterns include non-uniform interiors: train 1 has irregular shapes with 1's and 8's that become more complex with 4's/7's; train 2 has repeating horizontal bands that resolve into vertical motifs with 1's/2's interrupting 9's; train 3 has solid blocks (5's and 4's) that embed finer 3/8 patterns, implying hierarchical structure or overlay rules.
 * Grids are consistently 20 rows by 24 columns post-crop, but inputs are likely 30 columns wide; no rotation, scaling, or dimension changes are needed, but connected regions (e.g., blobs of same numbers) may need extraction or replacement based on size, shape, or position.
 * Easy-to-miss: Uniform generated outputs (e.g., all 8's/9's in bands) ignore subtle interruptions or encodings in the original (e.g., 1's/2's as separators or holes); right-side elements like 6's in test may be frame remnants needing removal; 0's in test could be empty space or background, but without transformation, they persist incorrectly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, focused solely on left cropping; future attempts must address interior decoding (e.g., pattern recognition for shapes like letters/symbols); handle variable border thicknesses if present; ensure output matches exact expected values, not just dimensions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def crop_left_border(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Crops the left 6 columns (frame) from each row, assuming 30-column input, to yield 24-column interior.
    This is a necessary first step as it correctly removes the consistent left frame in all examples,
    but must be combined with interior processing for full correctness.
    """
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```

No other functions from the attempt; no extraction tools for blobs/objects were provided, but they would be essential for identifying and transforming patterns (e.g., connected components of numbers like 8's into decoded shapes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and removes the left border (6 columns of frame), which aligns with the positioning of main content in all training examples and produces the right dimensions (24 columns), but fails entirely on interior content by copying values verbatim without transformation.
 * Train 1: Generated a simple diagonal/rectangular shape of 3's filled with 8's and isolated 1's, but expected a more intricate pattern with 4's/7's replacing many 8's, 1's repositioned or expanded, and additional 4's/7's in non-8 areas (e.g., row 2 expected has 4's/3's mix where generated has all 3's; unknown why 8's map to 4/7 but likely shape decoding).
 * Train 2: Generated uniform horizontal bands of 8's interrupted only by 9's, but expected inserts 1's/2's in specific positions (e.g., row 0 expected starts [2,2,1,...] where generated has all 8's/9's; this misses patterned motifs like checkerboard or symbols in the 8/9 areas).
 * Train 3: Generated solid horizontal blocks of 5's (top/bottom) and 4's (middle), but expected embeds 3/8 patterns within those blocks (e.g., row 1 expected has 3/8 interruptions in 5's where generated is uniform 5's; row 6 expected mixes 3/8 in 4's area).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but naive cropping alone is insufficient and broken for the full problem (do not use without adding pattern recognition or mapping rules).
 * Extracting objects/blobs (not implemented) seems essential for future attempts to handle shape-based transformations, as generated outputs ignore connected regions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it merely crops the left 6 columns, resulting in a grid of 9's (likely background/frame), 0's (empty or interior space), 6's (right frame remnants), and scattered 2/3/4/7's, but based on training examples, this unchanged interior likely needs transformation (e.g., 9/0/6 patterns should decode into mixed numbers like 1/2/3/4/7/8 as in trains; scattered digits like 2/4 in row 2 may be part of shapes that get filled or replaced).
 * It preserves right-side 6's (e.g., column 19 in many rows), which may be a right border needing cropping (e.g., to 24 columns total, but test shows 24 values with 6's at end, suggesting incomplete frame removal); uniform 9's and 0's bands resemble train 2/3 generated failures, missing subtle embeddings (e.g., row 10 has 3's that might expand into patterns).
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exactly, but it does not make sense as a final puzzle solution since training shows interiors must be actively processed, not copied; account for potential right-cropping (e.g., remove last 0-6 columns if 6's are frame) and blob detection to handle isolated 0/3/7 as object starts.

 * Grids are consistently 20 rows by 24 columns post-crop, but inputs are likely 30 columns wide; no rotation, scaling, or dimension changes are needed, but connected regions (e.g., blobs of same numbers) may need extraction or replacement based on size, shape, or position.
 * Easy-to-miss: Uniform generated outputs (e.g., all 8's/9's in bands) ignore subtle interruptions or encodings in the original (e.g., 1's/2's as separators or holes); right-side elements like 6's in test may be frame remnants needing removal; 0's in test could be empty space or background, but without transformation, they persist incorrectly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, focused solely on left cropping; future attempts must address interior decoding (e.g., pattern recognition for shapes like letters/symbols); handle variable border thicknesses if present; ensure output matches exact expected values, not just dimensions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def crop_left_border(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Crops the left 6 columns (frame) from each row, assuming 30-column input, to yield 24-column interior.
    This is a necessary first step as it correctly removes the consistent left frame in all examples,
    but must be combined with interior processing for full correctness.
    """
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```

No other functions from the attempt; no extraction tools for blobs/objects were provided, but they would be essential for identifying and transforming patterns (e.g., connected components of numbers like 8's into decoded shapes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and removes the left border (6 columns of frame), which aligns with the positioning of main content in all training examples and produces the right dimensions (24 columns), but fails entirely on interior content by copying values verbatim without transformation.
 * Train 1: Generated a simple diagonal/rectangular shape of 3's filled with 8's and isolated 1's, but expected a more intricate pattern with 4's/7's replacing many 8's, 1's repositioned or expanded, and additional 4's/7's in non-8 areas (e.g., row 2 expected has 4's/3's mix where generated has all 3's; unknown why 8's map to 4/7 but likely shape decoding).
 * Train 2: Generated uniform horizontal bands of 8's interrupted only by 9's, but expected inserts 1's/2's in specific positions (e.g., row 0 expected starts [2,2,1,...] where generated has all 8's/9's; this misses patterned motifs like checkerboard or symbols in the 8/9 areas).
 * Train 3: Generated solid horizontal blocks of 5's (top/bottom) and 4's (middle), but expected embeds 3/8 patterns within those blocks (e.g., row 1 expected has 3/8 interruptions in 5's where generated is uniform 5's; row 6 expected mixes 3/8 in 4's area).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but naive cropping alone is insufficient and broken for the full problem (do not use without adding pattern recognition or mapping rules).
 * Extracting objects/blobs (not implemented) seems essential for future attempts to handle shape-based transformations, as generated outputs ignore connected regions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it merely crops the left 6 columns, resulting in a grid of 9's (likely background/frame), 0's (empty or interior space), 6's (right frame remnants), and scattered 2/3/4/7's, but based on training examples, this unchanged interior likely needs transformation (e.g., 9/0/6 patterns should decode into mixed numbers like 1/2/3/4/7/8 as in trains; scattered digits like 2/4 in row 2 may be part of shapes that get filled or replaced).
 * It preserves right-side 6's (e.g., column 19 in many rows), which may be a right border needing cropping (e.g., to 24 columns total, but test shows 24 values with 6's at end, suggesting incomplete frame removal); uniform 9's and 0's bands resemble train 2/3 generated failures, missing subtle embeddings (e.g., row 10 has 3's that might expand into patterns).
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exactly, but it does not make sense as a final puzzle solution since training shows interiors must be actively processed, not copied; account for potential right-cropping (e.g., remove last 0-6 columns if 6's are frame) and blob detection to handle isolated 0/3/7 as object starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where the left portion of each row (likely columns 0-5) encodes a pattern or rule that must be extracted and applied as an overlay or transformation to the cropped main content area (likely columns 6-29, producing 24 elements per row). The goal is to generate a modified output grid that matches expected transformations, involving header normalizations, pattern cycling for empty rows, and periodic overlays, but the current approach misapplies these rules leading to mismatches in pattern propagation, header extensions, and overlay positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 columns, ignoring or framing with specific values like 0,6,7; leading frames determine repetition, and non-zero values after form the core pattern, but this fails when patterns shift or cycle incorrectly across consecutive empty rows.
 * Header normalization extends initial runs of 5's to exactly 3 cells and 3's to 6 cells by overwriting subsequent cells, but this is applied universally without checking row context, leading to over-extension or incorrect starts (e.g., turning partial 5's into full 3's prematurely).
 * Overlays apply a 3-element pattern (padded/repeated if short, with 1's mapped to 4's) starting at index 9 of the crop, repeating every 6 positions for the first 3 slots of each block, but this ignores varying block structures, deeper pattern rotations (e.g., [1:] + [0] for cycles), and doesn't handle cases where patterns evolve mid-grid or interact with existing content like 8's or 9's.
 * Consecutive empty patterns (no non-frame values in left) carry the previous pattern but cycle it (e.g., rotate left by 1), resetting counter on new patterns; however, the cycle logic only triggers after >1 empty, which misses single-empty carries and fails on long sequences.
 * Crop is always row[6:30] (24 elements), assuming fixed width; outputs must preserve this length without introducing 0's unless they are part of the expected transformation.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may need to be derived from cumulative or row-spanning logic (e.g., vertical alignment across rows), 1's specifically map to 4's in overlays but not elsewhere, and certain values like 8's or 9's act as backgrounds that overlays replace selectively; empty lefts don't always cycle but may default to all-5 or all-3 headers.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show progressive shifts (e.g., 5's shrinking, 3's expanding, overlays inserting 4/7/8 blocks), suggesting rules tied to row index or global progression, not just per-row left extraction.
 * Avoid universal normalization—some rows in expected have irregular headers (e.g., single 5's or mixed 3/8 without extension); overlays may start earlier/later or apply to different strides based on pattern length.
 * 0's in left indicate frames/empties but should not propagate to output crops unless expected; test inputs have 0's in crops, which generated outputs retain incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract pattern from left 5 columns based on leading frame colors (0,6,7)."""
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    leading = 0
    i = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []  # Empty pattern
    first = left[i]
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function partially works for identifying leading repeats but fails on complex lefts with mixed non-frames; useful as a starting point for extraction but needs refinement for cycling.)

```python
def normalize_header(crop: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extend initial runs of 5 and 3 to 3 and 6 respectively by overwriting next cells."""
    crop = crop[:]  # Copy
    # Extend 5's to 3
    num5 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 5
    # Re-find and extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(crop) and crop[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    num3 = 0
    i = start3
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 3
    return crop
```
(This is broken for rows without initial 5/3 runs, as it forces extensions where expected outputs have different starts like 8's or 4's; not helpful without conditional application based on left pattern.)

```python
def apply_overlay(crop: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Apply pattern overlay starting from position 9, every 6 positions, replacing first 3."""
    p = pattern[:]
    while len(p) < 3 and p:
        p.append(p[-1])
    p = p[:3]
    result = crop[:]
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Map 1's to 4's
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(3):
            if start + k < 24:
                result[start + k] = p[k]
    return result
```
(This overlays too rigidly at fixed starts/stride, ignoring expected variations like shifting to positions 0-8 or different repeats; unhelpful for dynamic patterns, e.g., rotating 7/8 blocks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the crop as row[6:30] and handles basic pattern extraction from left, with consecutive empty logic attempting carry-over, but fails overall as all training examples are incorrect.
 * For Training 1: Rows 0-1 match expected headers exactly ([5x5 + 3x22 +5x2] and [5x4 +3x20]), but row 2 mismatches from pos 9-11 (generated 4,4,4 vs expected 3,3,3) and pos 18-20 (3,3,3 vs 4,4,4), showing overlay wrongly inserts 4's where 3's should persist; row 4 mismatches pos 10 (7 vs nothing, expected has 4,7,4 but generated shifts); row 5 major mismatch (generated 4,7,4,8x3 vs expected 5,5,3x5,8x2 + all 4's), indicating failed header shrink and wrong overlay cycle; later rows like 8-12 insert 1's/4's incorrectly where expected has 8's/3's evolving vertically; row 17 has 6's where expected has 3's/8's, suggesting pattern misderivation from left.
 * For Training 2: Almost no matches—row 0 generated [5x3,3x6,9,8x5,9x4,8x4] vs expected [2x2,1,8x2,9,2x2,1,9,8x5,9x4,8x4], wrong headers and overlays (9/8 blocks overwritten incorrectly); row 1 has 4's/2's where expected has 2's/9's, showing 1->4 map applied wrongly and pattern [4,4,2] not matching expected [2,2,2]; repetitive 4/8/9 blocks in rows 5-12 ignore expected cycling of 1/2 patterns; row 13 introduces 6's mismatched to expected 2's, indicating broken cycling for empties.
 * For Training 3: Row 0 all 5's matches, but row 1 generated [5x9,3x3,5x3,3x3,5x3,3x3] vs expected [5x15,3,8,3x2,8,3x2,8,3], wrong extension of 3's and missing 8 insertions; row 2 has 8,3,8 repeats where expected has 3,8x2,3 etc., close but shifted; rows 5-9 mismatch overlays (e.g., row 5 generated 3x6 +8,4x3 etc. vs expected 4x15,3,8x2,4x3,3,8x2), failing to propagate 4's fully; rows 15-19 repetitive 4/6 but expected all 4's, showing over-application of patterns.
 * get_pattern is somewhat helpful for simple lefts but broken for frames with embedded non-zeros or when leading != repeat count.
 * normalize_header is not helpful—overwrites too aggressively, causing header mismatches in all examples where expected has non-extended or alternative starts (e.g., direct 8's in train3).
 * apply_overlay is incorrect—fixed range(9,24,6) misses early overlays (e.g., pos 0 in some expected) and doesn't rotate patterns per row, leading to static repeats; don't use without dynamic start/stride.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of cropping and left extraction but misses vertical/global pattern evolution, conditional normalization, and flexible overlays; consecutive_empty >1 for cycling is too strict, as some expected carries happen on first empty.
 * No functions for vertical alignment or cumulative patterns, which seems essential given row-to-row progressions in expected (e.g., shrinking 5's, expanding 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it retains many 0's from the input crop (e.g., row 0 pos 9-11=0,0,9... but ends with 6,0x4, introducing artifacts not in training expecteds, which avoid 0's in structured blocks), suggesting failed overwriting or pattern application leaves empties untouched.
 * Headers are mostly [5x3,3x6] which may be right for some rows, but overlays insert inconsistent 4/6/3/9 blocks (e.g., row 1: 4,4,6,9x3,4,4,6,9,6,0,4,4,6 with lingering 0's and mismatched 6's where patterns cycle wrongly); row 4 has 3,6,4 repeats but expected likely needs full 9/6 propagation without 0's.
 * Later rows like 13-17 have 0's in pos 12-14/18 (e.g., 3,6,4,0x3,3,6,4,0,6,0,3,6,4), which looks like incomplete overlays or failed normalization, not matching clean block structures in training expecteds (e.g., no 0's, full 3/4/8/9 fills).
 * Row 26 has [5x3,3x6,4x3,9x3,4x3,4,9,6,0,4x3] with 0's and partial 6's, indicating the cycling/overlay logic breaks on long sequences, producing messy outputs unlike expected uniform transformations.
 * Overall, test output makes no sense as a solved puzzle—too many 0's and irregularities suggest the program doesn't fully transform the crop, missing core rules like complete replacement or background filling.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 23:51:47] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors, shapes, or symbols in a larger image) where the left margin (first 5-6 columns) of each row encodes instructions or patterns that must be extracted, processed (e.g., rotated, mapped, normalized), and overlaid onto the main body of the grid (columns 6-30, cropped to 24 elements) to complete or transform the image according to repeating or propagating rules. The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, such as extending headers, filling sections with rotated motifs, or applying cyclic overlays, while handling special cases like empty patterns or frame elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 elements of each row; elements 0,6,7 seem to act as "frame" or ignore markers that skip leading positions, but only if they don't fill the entire left side—subtlety: if the entire left is frame, return empty and rotate the previous row's pattern.
 * Empty patterns (all frame or invalid) inherit and rotate the previous row's pattern leftward (cycle shift), but this rotation must preserve length and only apply when needed; easy to miss: rotation happens before mapping/padding, and original length tracks for header normalization.
 * Mapping rule: 1 specifically maps to 4, while other values pass through—subtlety: this is likely a color/symbol substitution, but only for certain extracted elements; don't apply globally.
 * Padding: Patterns shorter than 3 are padded by repeating the last element (or 0 if empty), then truncated to exactly 3—key: this ensures consistent overlay size, but over-padding can cause repetition errors in longer sections.
 * Normalization for headers: Rows with empty patterns (original_len==0) extend leading 5's to exactly 3 positions (overwriting if needed), then extend following 3's to exactly 6 positions—subtlety: this only applies to "header" rows without patterns; it doesn't touch other numbers, and extensions stop at row length (24 after crop).
 * Overlay application: Patterns (padded to 3) are stamped starting at positions 9,15,21 (0-indexed in the 24-element cropped row), overwriting existing values—easy to miss: this creates 3 repeating sections per row, but only if pos <24; it ignores the first 9 positions (likely a fixed left area) and assumes crop starts at original index 6.
 * Grid structure: Input g has rows of at least 30 elements; output is cropped to [6:30] (24 elems) per row, height preserved; patterns propagate vertically via previous_pattern, so row dependencies are crucial—subtlety: no horizontal propagation, but vertical inheritance can create staggered or rotating motifs across rows.
 * Special numbers: 5 often acts as a header/start marker (extends to 3), 3 as a filler/extender (to 6), 8/9 as backgrounds or walls; 4,6,7 as pattern elements; 0/1/2 as placeholders or holes—key: overlays can overwrite these, but extractions must avoid frame pollution.
 * Edge cases: Full-empty rows rotate prior; leading non-frame starts pattern immediately; if leading==0, pattern is just [first]; append non-zero from rest of left—subtlety: this skips 0's in extraction but includes them in patterns sometimes, leading to 0-padding issues.
 * Overall rules: Transform preserves structure but fills/completes sections based on left cues; mismatches often from incorrect extraction (e.g., including frame), wrong rotation timing, or overlay positions; consider vertical continuity and exact length enforcement to avoid spillover.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This extracts patterns by skipping leading frame elements and building from first non-frame, appending non-zeros; useful for left-margin parsing, but buggy on full-frame or mixed 0/non-0.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cycle shift for inheritance; helpful for propagating patterns vertically, but needs careful application only on empties.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads to fixed overlay size; useful, but repetition can amplify errors if pattern is wrong.)

```python
def normalize_header(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    row = row[:]
    # Extend 5's to 3
    i = 0
    num5 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 5
    # Extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(row) and row[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    i = start3
    num3 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 3
    return row
```
(Handles header extension for empty-pattern rows; partially useful for 5/3 rules, but limited to leading sequences and doesn't handle other fillers like 8/9.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(len(p)):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Stamps pattern in sections 9-11,15-17,21-23; core for filling, but assumes p len=3 and fixed starts—helpful if positions are correct.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of left-extraction and overlay but incorrect pattern building, rotation, and normalization.
 * Train 1: Generated short/incomplete 3-extensions (e.g., first row has only four 3's then 0's, but expected 20+ 3's across sections with trailing 5's); mismatched overlays like row 5 having scattered 7/8 instead of uniform 4's, row 8 having 1's in wrong spots vs expected 4's/8's; row 9 has 1's and 4's but expected mixed 8/4/7 with 3-end; unknown why 1's appear (from unmapped extraction?) and rotations don't align vertical motifs.
 * Train 2: Generated repetitive 4's/2's/6's in overlays but ignores left patterns like 2/1/8/9; first row starts with 5/3 but expected 2/1/8/9 blocks; many rows have uniform 4's where expected cyclic 2/1/9/8 sections—missed vertical pattern variation and header omission; 0's and 9's not propagated correctly.
 * Train 3: Generated inconsistent 5/3/8 overlays with 0's and 4's, but expected structured 5-headers then 3/8 motifs in sections; row 1 has 3/8 but expected all-5 then 8's; row 6 has 3/8/3 but expected uniform 4's then 3/8/8; lower rows have 2's/4's/6's where expected all-5 or all-4—rotation and padding over-applied, frame skipping wrong.
 * get_pattern is helpful for extraction but broken: includes leading repeats incorrectly (e.g., * leading but if leading=0 just [first]), skips 0's but not always, and fails on full-frame without proper empty check.
 * rotate_left is useful but applied too broadly (e.g., on non-empties), causing pattern drift.
 * pad_pattern and map_pattern (1->4) are directionally correct but amplify errors (e.g., padding 0's leads to blank sections).
 * normalize_header only for empties but buggy: extends 5 to 3 and 3 to 6, but doesn't handle longer sequences or other numbers like 8/9; unhelpful for non-header rows.
 * apply_overlay positions (9,15,21) seem right for 3-section repeat but overwrites too much/too little, missing first 9 cols and not aligning with expected full-row fills.
 * Overall: No training passed; understanding shows vertical inheritance and sectional overlays, but misses exact extension rules, full pattern cycling, and background preservation—avoid global mapping or fixed paddings without checks.
 * Function map_pattern is simple/subtle-useful (1->4), but normalize_header is partially broken (wrong start3 calc after 5's, limited scope).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it features heavy repetition of 9's and 0's in early columns (likely unprocessed left area), with cyclic overlays of [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] in positions ~9-11/15-17/21-23 across many rows, but introduces inconsistencies like scattered 6's/3's in row 10+ and 0-blocks in rows 13-16, suggesting faulty rotation/padding on varying left inputs (e.g., test left has 9/0 mixes not extracted well).
 * It mismatches puzzle logic: Expected likely has structured 9-backgrounds with rotating 3/4/6 motifs filling sections uniformly (similar to train 2's cycles), but generated has partial overwrites (e.g., row 1 has 9,6,0 at end vs probable full pattern) and abrupt 0-rows (13-16) that should propagate prior patterns; lower rows revert to 4/3/6 cycles but with extra 6's/4's, indicating over-rotation or wrong inheritance—looks messy/incomplete, not matching vertical continuity in trainings.
 * No expected provided, but based on trainings, it should avoid 0-spillover and ensure overlays align across rows (e.g., staggering like train 1's 4/7/8); current output has too many isolated 6's and unnormalized headers, so incorrect—account for 9/6 as potential frames or mappers to fix.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 23:51:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors, patterns, or elements in a bordered frame, and the task is to process the input grid to output a cleaned or transformed version of the interior puzzle content, preserving the overall structure but correctly interpreting or extracting the main visual elements while removing framing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * All inputs appear to have a consistent left border (first 6 columns) consisting of frame elements like 6's or other consistent values that frame the puzzle, which must be cropped to access the 24-column interior; however, simply cropping without further processing leaves the interior numbers unchanged, which does not match expectations.
 * Interiors contain patterns of numbers (e.g., 3's, 8's, 4's, 7's, 1's, 9's, 0's) that likely represent shapes, objects, or encoded visuals; expected outputs show transformations or replacements in these areas (e.g., blocks of 8's become mixed 4's/7's in train 1, uniform 9's become patterned 1's/2's in train 2), suggesting rules for decoding, filling, or recognizing connected components/blobs rather than literal copying.
 * Top and bottom rows often retain border-like values (e.g., 5's in train 1 and 3), indicating that horizontal borders may be part of the output or need selective preservation, while vertical frames (left/right) are fully removed; right borders (e.g., 6's in test) may also need cropping or handling.
 * Subtle patterns include non-uniform interiors: train 1 has irregular shapes with 1's and 8's that become more complex with 4's/7's; train 2 has repeating horizontal bands that resolve into vertical motifs with 1's/2's interrupting 9's; train 3 has solid blocks (5's and 4's) that embed finer 3/8 patterns, implying hierarchical structure or overlay rules.
 * Grids are consistently 20 rows by 24 columns post-crop, but inputs are likely 30 columns wide; no rotation, scaling, or dimension changes are needed, but connected regions (e.g., blobs of same numbers) may need extraction or replacement based on size, shape, or position.
 * Easy-to-miss: Uniform generated outputs (e.g., all 8's/9's in bands) ignore subtle interruptions or encodings in the original (e.g., 1's/2's as separators or holes); right-side elements like 6's in test may be frame remnants needing removal; 0's in test could be empty space or background, but without transformation, they persist incorrectly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, focused solely on left cropping; future attempts must address interior decoding (e.g., pattern recognition for shapes like letters/symbols); handle variable border thicknesses if present; ensure output matches exact expected values, not just dimensions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def crop_left_border(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Crops the left 6 columns (frame) from each row, assuming 30-column input, to yield 24-column interior.
    This is a necessary first step as it correctly removes the consistent left frame in all examples,
    but must be combined with interior processing for full correctness.
    """
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```

No other functions from the attempt; no extraction tools for blobs/objects were provided, but they would be essential for identifying and transforming patterns (e.g., connected components of numbers like 8's into decoded shapes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and removes the left border (6 columns of frame), which aligns with the positioning of main content in all training examples and produces the right dimensions (24 columns), but fails entirely on interior content by copying values verbatim without transformation.
 * Train 1: Generated a simple diagonal/rectangular shape of 3's filled with 8's and isolated 1's, but expected a more intricate pattern with 4's/7's replacing many 8's, 1's repositioned or expanded, and additional 4's/7's in non-8 areas (e.g., row 2 expected has 4's/3's mix where generated has all 3's; unknown why 8's map to 4/7 but likely shape decoding).
 * Train 2: Generated uniform horizontal bands of 8's interrupted only by 9's, but expected inserts 1's/2's in specific positions (e.g., row 0 expected starts [2,2,1,...] where generated has all 8's/9's; this misses patterned motifs like checkerboard or symbols in the 8/9 areas).
 * Train 3: Generated solid horizontal blocks of 5's (top/bottom) and 4's (middle), but expected embeds 3/8 patterns within those blocks (e.g., row 1 expected has 3/8 interruptions in 5's where generated is uniform 5's; row 6 expected mixes 3/8 in 4's area).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but naive cropping alone is insufficient and broken for the full problem (do not use without adding pattern recognition or mapping rules).
 * Extracting objects/blobs (not implemented) seems essential for future attempts to handle shape-based transformations, as generated outputs ignore connected regions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it merely crops the left 6 columns, resulting in a grid of 9's (likely background/frame), 0's (empty or interior space), 6's (right frame remnants), and scattered 2/3/4/7's, but based on training examples, this unchanged interior likely needs transformation (e.g., 9/0/6 patterns should decode into mixed numbers like 1/2/3/4/7/8 as in trains; scattered digits like 2/4 in row 2 may be part of shapes that get filled or replaced).
 * It preserves right-side 6's (e.g., column 19 in many rows), which may be a right border needing cropping (e.g., to 24 columns total, but test shows 24 values with 6's at end, suggesting incomplete frame removal); uniform 9's and 0's bands resemble train 2/3 generated failures, missing subtle embeddings (e.g., row 10 has 3's that might expand into patterns).
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exactly, but it does not make sense as a final puzzle solution since training shows interiors must be actively processed, not copied; account for potential right-cropping (e.g., remove last 0-6 columns if 6's are frame) and blob detection to handle isolated 0/3/7 as object starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where the left portion of each row (likely columns 0-5) encodes a pattern or rule that must be extracted and applied as an overlay or transformation to the cropped main content area (likely columns 6-29, producing 24 elements per row). The goal is to generate a modified output grid that matches expected transformations, involving header normalizations, pattern cycling for empty rows, and periodic overlays, but the current approach misapplies these rules leading to mismatches in pattern propagation, header extensions, and overlay positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 columns, ignoring or framing with specific values like 0,6,7; leading frames determine repetition, and non-zero values after form the core pattern, but this fails when patterns shift or cycle incorrectly across consecutive empty rows.
 * Header normalization extends initial runs of 5's to exactly 3 cells and 3's to 6 cells by overwriting subsequent cells, but this is applied universally without checking row context, leading to over-extension or incorrect starts (e.g., turning partial 5's into full 3's prematurely).
 * Overlays apply a 3-element pattern (padded/repeated if short, with 1's mapped to 4's) starting at index 9 of the crop, repeating every 6 positions for the first 3 slots of each block, but this ignores varying block structures, deeper pattern rotations (e.g., [1:] + [0] for cycles), and doesn't handle cases where patterns evolve mid-grid or interact with existing content like 8's or 9's.
 * Consecutive empty patterns (no non-frame values in left) carry the previous pattern but cycle it (e.g., rotate left by 1), resetting counter on new patterns; however, the cycle logic only triggers after >1 empty, which misses single-empty carries and fails on long sequences.
 * Crop is always row[6:30] (24 elements), assuming fixed width; outputs must preserve this length without introducing 0's unless they are part of the expected transformation.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may need to be derived from cumulative or row-spanning logic (e.g., vertical alignment across rows), 1's specifically map to 4's in overlays but not elsewhere, and certain values like 8's or 9's act as backgrounds that overlays replace selectively; empty lefts don't always cycle but may default to all-5 or all-3 headers.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show progressive shifts (e.g., 5's shrinking, 3's expanding, overlays inserting 4/7/8 blocks), suggesting rules tied to row index or global progression, not just per-row left extraction.
 * Avoid universal normalization—some rows in expected have irregular headers (e.g., single 5's or mixed 3/8 without extension); overlays may start earlier/later or apply to different strides based on pattern length.
 * 0's in left indicate frames/empties but should not propagate to output crops unless expected; test inputs have 0's in crops, which generated outputs retain incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract pattern from left 5 columns based on leading frame colors (0,6,7)."""
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    leading = 0
    i = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []  # Empty pattern
    first = left[i]
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function partially works for identifying leading repeats but fails on complex lefts with mixed non-frames; useful as a starting point for extraction but needs refinement for cycling.)

```python
def normalize_header(crop: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extend initial runs of 5 and 3 to 3 and 6 respectively by overwriting next cells."""
    crop = crop[:]  # Copy
    # Extend 5's to 3
    num5 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 5
    # Re-find and extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(crop) and crop[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    num3 = 0
    i = start3
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 3
    return crop
```
(This is broken for rows without initial 5/3 runs, as it forces extensions where expected outputs have different starts like 8's or 4's; not helpful without conditional application based on left pattern.)

```python
def apply_overlay(crop: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Apply pattern overlay starting from position 9, every 6 positions, replacing first 3."""
    p = pattern[:]
    while len(p) < 3 and p:
        p.append(p[-1])
    p = p[:3]
    result = crop[:]
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Map 1's to 4's
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(3):
            if start + k < 24:
                result[start + k] = p[k]
    return result
```
(This overlays too rigidly at fixed starts/stride, ignoring expected variations like shifting to positions 0-8 or different repeats; unhelpful for dynamic patterns, e.g., rotating 7/8 blocks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the crop as row[6:30] and handles basic pattern extraction from left, with consecutive empty logic attempting carry-over, but fails overall as all training examples are incorrect.
 * For Training 1: Rows 0-1 match expected headers exactly ([5x5 + 3x22 +5x2] and [5x4 +3x20]), but row 2 mismatches from pos 9-11 (generated 4,4,4 vs expected 3,3,3) and pos 18-20 (3,3,3 vs 4,4,4), showing overlay wrongly inserts 4's where 3's should persist; row 4 mismatches pos 10 (7 vs nothing, expected has 4,7,4 but generated shifts); row 5 major mismatch (generated 4,7,4,8x3 vs expected 5,5,3x5,8x2 + all 4's), indicating failed header shrink and wrong overlay cycle; later rows like 8-12 insert 1's/4's incorrectly where expected has 8's/3's evolving vertically; row 17 has 6's where expected has 3's/8's, suggesting pattern misderivation from left.
 * For Training 2: Almost no matches—row 0 generated [5x3,3x6,9,8x5,9x4,8x4] vs expected [2x2,1,8x2,9,2x2,1,9,8x5,9x4,8x4], wrong headers and overlays (9/8 blocks overwritten incorrectly); row 1 has 4's/2's where expected has 2's/9's, showing 1->4 map applied wrongly and pattern [4,4,2] not matching expected [2,2,2]; repetitive 4/8/9 blocks in rows 5-12 ignore expected cycling of 1/2 patterns; row 13 introduces 6's mismatched to expected 2's, indicating broken cycling for empties.
 * For Training 3: Row 0 all 5's matches, but row 1 generated [5x9,3x3,5x3,3x3,5x3,3x3] vs expected [5x15,3,8,3x2,8,3x2,8,3], wrong extension of 3's and missing 8 insertions; row 2 has 8,3,8 repeats where expected has 3,8x2,3 etc., close but shifted; rows 5-9 mismatch overlays (e.g., row 5 generated 3x6 +8,4x3 etc. vs expected 4x15,3,8x2,4x3,3,8x2), failing to propagate 4's fully; rows 15-19 repetitive 4/6 but expected all 4's, showing over-application of patterns.
 * get_pattern is somewhat helpful for simple lefts but broken for frames with embedded non-zeros or when leading != repeat count.
 * normalize_header is not helpful—overwrites too aggressively, causing header mismatches in all examples where expected has non-extended or alternative starts (e.g., direct 8's in train3).
 * apply_overlay is incorrect—fixed range(9,24,6) misses early overlays (e.g., pos 0 in some expected) and doesn't rotate patterns per row, leading to static repeats; don't use without dynamic start/stride.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of cropping and left extraction but misses vertical/global pattern evolution, conditional normalization, and flexible overlays; consecutive_empty >1 for cycling is too strict, as some expected carries happen on first empty.
 * No functions for vertical alignment or cumulative patterns, which seems essential given row-to-row progressions in expected (e.g., shrinking 5's, expanding 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it retains many 0's from the input crop (e.g., row 0 pos 9-11=0,0,9... but ends with 6,0x4, introducing artifacts not in training expecteds, which avoid 0's in structured blocks), suggesting failed overwriting or pattern application leaves empties untouched.
 * Headers are mostly [5x3,3x6] which may be right for some rows, but overlays insert inconsistent 4/6/3/9 blocks (e.g., row 1: 4,4,6,9x3,4,4,6,9,6,0,4,4,6 with lingering 0's and mismatched 6's where patterns cycle wrongly); row 4 has 3,6,4 repeats but expected likely needs full 9/6 propagation without 0's.
 * Later rows like 13-17 have 0's in pos 12-14/18 (e.g., 3,6,4,0x3,3,6,4,0,6,0,3,6,4), which looks like incomplete overlays or failed normalization, not matching clean block structures in training expecteds (e.g., no 0's, full 3/4/8/9 fills).
 * Row 26 has [5x3,3x6,4x3,9x3,4x3,4,9,6,0,4x3] with 0's and partial 6's, indicating the cycling/overlay logic breaks on long sequences, producing messy outputs unlike expected uniform transformations.
 * Overall, test output makes no sense as a solved puzzle—too many 0's and irregularities suggest the program doesn't fully transform the crop, missing core rules like complete replacement or background filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors, shapes, or symbols in a larger image) where the left margin (first 5-6 columns) of each row encodes instructions or patterns that must be extracted, processed (e.g., rotated, mapped, normalized), and overlaid onto the main body of the grid (columns 6-30, cropped to 24 elements) to complete or transform the image according to repeating or propagating rules. The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, such as extending headers, filling sections with rotated motifs, or applying cyclic overlays, while handling special cases like empty patterns or frame elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 elements of each row; elements 0,6,7 seem to act as "frame" or ignore markers that skip leading positions, but only if they don't fill the entire left side—subtlety: if the entire left is frame, return empty and rotate the previous row's pattern.
 * Empty patterns (all frame or invalid) inherit and rotate the previous row's pattern leftward (cycle shift), but this rotation must preserve length and only apply when needed; easy to miss: rotation happens before mapping/padding, and original length tracks for header normalization.
 * Mapping rule: 1 specifically maps to 4, while other values pass through—subtlety: this is likely a color/symbol substitution, but only for certain extracted elements; don't apply globally.
 * Padding: Patterns shorter than 3 are padded by repeating the last element (or 0 if empty), then truncated to exactly 3—key: this ensures consistent overlay size, but over-padding can cause repetition errors in longer sections.
 * Normalization for headers: Rows with empty patterns (original_len==0) extend leading 5's to exactly 3 positions (overwriting if needed), then extend following 3's to exactly 6 positions—subtlety: this only applies to "header" rows without patterns; it doesn't touch other numbers, and extensions stop at row length (24 after crop).
 * Overlay application: Patterns (padded to 3) are stamped starting at positions 9,15,21 (0-indexed in the 24-element cropped row), overwriting existing values—easy to miss: this creates 3 repeating sections per row, but only if pos <24; it ignores the first 9 positions (likely a fixed left area) and assumes crop starts at original index 6.
 * Grid structure: Input g has rows of at least 30 elements; output is cropped to [6:30] (24 elems) per row, height preserved; patterns propagate vertically via previous_pattern, so row dependencies are crucial—subtlety: no horizontal propagation, but vertical inheritance can create staggered or rotating motifs across rows.
 * Special numbers: 5 often acts as a header/start marker (extends to 3), 3 as a filler/extender (to 6), 8/9 as backgrounds or walls; 4,6,7 as pattern elements; 0/1/2 as placeholders or holes—key: overlays can overwrite these, but extractions must avoid frame pollution.
 * Edge cases: Full-empty rows rotate prior; leading non-frame starts pattern immediately; if leading==0, pattern is just [first]; append non-zero from rest of left—subtlety: this skips 0's in extraction but includes them in patterns sometimes, leading to 0-padding issues.
 * Overall rules: Transform preserves structure but fills/completes sections based on left cues; mismatches often from incorrect extraction (e.g., including frame), wrong rotation timing, or overlay positions; consider vertical continuity and exact length enforcement to avoid spillover.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This extracts patterns by skipping leading frame elements and building from first non-frame, appending non-zeros; useful for left-margin parsing, but buggy on full-frame or mixed 0/non-0.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cycle shift for inheritance; helpful for propagating patterns vertically, but needs careful application only on empties.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads to fixed overlay size; useful, but repetition can amplify errors if pattern is wrong.)

```python
def normalize_header(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    row = row[:]
    # Extend 5's to 3
    i = 0
    num5 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 5
    # Extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(row) and row[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    i = start3
    num3 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 3
    return row
```
(Handles header extension for empty-pattern rows; partially useful for 5/3 rules, but limited to leading sequences and doesn't handle other fillers like 8/9.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(len(p)):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Stamps pattern in sections 9-11,15-17,21-23; core for filling, but assumes p len=3 and fixed starts—helpful if positions are correct.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of left-extraction and overlay but incorrect pattern building, rotation, and normalization.
 * Train 1: Generated short/incomplete 3-extensions (e.g., first row has only four 3's then 0's, but expected 20+ 3's across sections with trailing 5's); mismatched overlays like row 5 having scattered 7/8 instead of uniform 4's, row 8 having 1's in wrong spots vs expected 4's/8's; row 9 has 1's and 4's but expected mixed 8/4/7 with 3-end; unknown why 1's appear (from unmapped extraction?) and rotations don't align vertical motifs.
 * Train 2: Generated repetitive 4's/2's/6's in overlays but ignores left patterns like 2/1/8/9; first row starts with 5/3 but expected 2/1/8/9 blocks; many rows have uniform 4's where expected cyclic 2/1/9/8 sections—missed vertical pattern variation and header omission; 0's and 9's not propagated correctly.
 * Train 3: Generated inconsistent 5/3/8 overlays with 0's and 4's, but expected structured 5-headers then 3/8 motifs in sections; row 1 has 3/8 but expected all-5 then 8's; row 6 has 3/8/3 but expected uniform 4's then 3/8/8; lower rows have 2's/4's/6's where expected all-5 or all-4—rotation and padding over-applied, frame skipping wrong.
 * get_pattern is helpful for extraction but broken: includes leading repeats incorrectly (e.g., * leading but if leading=0 just [first]), skips 0's but not always, and fails on full-frame without proper empty check.
 * rotate_left is useful but applied too broadly (e.g., on non-empties), causing pattern drift.
 * pad_pattern and map_pattern (1->4) are directionally correct but amplify errors (e.g., padding 0's leads to blank sections).
 * normalize_header only for empties but buggy: extends 5 to 3 and 3 to 6, but doesn't handle longer sequences or other numbers like 8/9; unhelpful for non-header rows.
 * apply_overlay positions (9,15,21) seem right for 3-section repeat but overwrites too much/too little, missing first 9 cols and not aligning with expected full-row fills.
 * Overall: No training passed; understanding shows vertical inheritance and sectional overlays, but misses exact extension rules, full pattern cycling, and background preservation—avoid global mapping or fixed paddings without checks.
 * Function map_pattern is simple/subtle-useful (1->4), but normalize_header is partially broken (wrong start3 calc after 5's, limited scope).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it features heavy repetition of 9's and 0's in early columns (likely unprocessed left area), with cyclic overlays of [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] in positions ~9-11/15-17/21-23 across many rows, but introduces inconsistencies like scattered 6's/3's in row 10+ and 0-blocks in rows 13-16, suggesting faulty rotation/padding on varying left inputs (e.g., test left has 9/0 mixes not extracted well).
 * It mismatches puzzle logic: Expected likely has structured 9-backgrounds with rotating 3/4/6 motifs filling sections uniformly (similar to train 2's cycles), but generated has partial overwrites (e.g., row 1 has 9,6,0 at end vs probable full pattern) and abrupt 0-rows (13-16) that should propagate prior patterns; lower rows revert to 4/3/6 cycles but with extra 6's/4's, indicating over-rotation or wrong inheritance—looks messy/incomplete, not matching vertical continuity in trainings.
 * No expected provided, but based on trainings, it should avoid 0-spillover and ensure overlays align across rows (e.g., staggering like train 1's 4/7/8); current output has too many isolated 6's and unnormalized headers, so incorrect—account for 9/6 as potential frames or mappers to fix.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 00:09:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (first 5 cells per row) encodes patterns or instructions (possibly frames, leading indicators, or sequences) that determine transformations or overlays applied to the main content area (crop from index 6 to 29, output as 24 elements). The goal is to process each row independently or with carry-over (e.g., rotation from previous patterns) to produce a modified grid matching expected visual structures, with final blank/edge filling using 9.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Left side (row[0:5]) uses a "frame" set {0,6,7} to detect leading non-content (e.g., borders or spacers); count leading frame elements to determine repetition of the first non-frame value, then append non-zero values from the remaining left cells—subtlety: if all left is frame or empty pattern, rotate from previous row's pattern, but this can propagate errors across rows.
 * Patterns are padded to exactly 3 elements (repeat last or use 0 if empty), then mapped (1 becomes 4, others unchanged) before overlay—easy to miss: overlay applies only to specific positions in crop (starting at index 9, then every 6 steps: 9-11, 15-17, 21-23), suggesting a 4x6 subgrid or column-wise insertion, but ignores earlier crop indices (0-8 stay as-is).
 * Carry-over via previous_pattern update only when a new pattern is detected, else use rotated version—subtlety: rotation is left-cyclic (p[1:] + [p[0]]), which may simulate shifting motifs, but fails if initial patterns are wrong, leading to cascading mismatches.
 * Final post-processing replaces 0 or 6 with 9 across the entire output row (not just crop), implying 0/6 are blanks/edges to be filled uniformly—key: this happens after overlay, so overlays can introduce non-9 values, but expected outputs show structured fills (e.g., solid 3s, 8s, or mixed 4/7/8) rather than sparse insertions.
 * Grid is 20-24 rows high, each row 30+ elements internally but cropped/output to 24; patterns seem to represent colors/shapes (e.g., 3=fill, 4=border, 7/8=patterns, 1=transformed to 4), with expectations showing symmetric or repeating motifs (e.g., rows of uniform 3s, checker-like 4/7/8).
 * Subtle across examples: Training 1 has evolving patterns (3s to 4/7/8 overlays on 3-base), Training 2 cycles 1/2 motifs into 9-base with 4/2 overlays, Training 3 mixes 5-base with 3/8 and 4/2 overlays—common: left encodes short sequences (1-3 elems), but program over-repeats or mis-rotates, leading to uniform 9-fills where structure expected.
 * Easy to miss: No global grid interactions (row-independent except pattern carry), but test input lacks provided left/crop details, so assumptions about input structure (e.g., all-9 base) may fail; outputs must preserve some original crop content while overlaying.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame 'leading' times
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function attempts to extract repeating motifs from left, useful for identifying sequence starts after frames, but flawed in repetition logic and empty handling—keep but fix for non-zero appends and frame edge cases.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cyclic shift for pattern carry-over; helpful for simulating rotation in multi-row motifs, but only useful if base patterns are correct.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads short patterns by repetition or 0; essential for consistent 3-element overlays, but 0-padding may introduce unwanted blanks before final 9-fill.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    p = pad_pattern(pattern)
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Transform 1 to 4 (possible color/shape map)
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):  # Overlays at 9-11, 15-17, 21-23 in crop
        for k in range(3):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Core overlay logic targeting right-side columns; helpful for inserting patterns into specific sub-areas, but misses left crop (0-8) and assumes crop len=24—adjust range if input varies.)

(The main program function ties these together with previous_pattern tracking and final 9-replacement; partially helpful for structure, but broken in pattern propagation and overlay scope.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs showing excessive 9-fills and misapplied overlays (e.g., sparse 4/3/7/8 insertions where expected solid blocks of 3/8 or repeating 4/7/8 patterns).
 * What worked: Basic left extraction via get_pattern correctly identifies some non-frame starts (e.g., in Train1 row3, detects 3 after leading, overlays 4s matching expected positions); overlay positions (9+) align with right-side motifs in partial matches (e.g., Train1 rows 3-5 have correct 4/7/8 spots but wrong values/context); final 9-replacement fills blanks appropriately in uniform areas (e.g., Train1 row1 ends with 9s like expected 3/5 but mismatched).
 * What didn't work: Pattern repetition over-applies leading count (e.g., Train1 row1 generates [5,5,5,...] but expected uniform 3/5 without repetition); rotation/empty handling propagates wrong patterns (e.g., Train1 rows 9-16 show repeated 4/1/8 but expected varied 4/7/8/1 with 3-edges); mapping 1->4 is inconsistent (Train2 expects 1/2 preserved in left, but overlays 4/2 wrongly); ignores original crop content fully in some rows, leading to all-9 where structure needed (e.g., Train3 rows 10-14 generate uniform 2s/4s but expected all-5s or 4-blocks).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated has fragmented 4/7/8 (e.g., row6: 7,4,4,8,8,8 but expected solid 4s); row9: 4,4,4,1,1,1 but expected 8,8,8,4,4,4 with trailing 8/3; row17: 4,4,9,8,8,8 but expected 8,8,8,4,7,4; unknown why 1s appear untransformed in some spots.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated cycles 4/2 overlays on 9-base but expected left-side 1/2/8 motifs with right 9-fills (e.g., row1: generated all-9/4/2 but expected 2,2,1,8,8,9,...); rows 14-20 show repeated 4/9 but expected repeating 2/2/1 blocks; function apply_overlay overwrites too aggressively, losing original 8/9 structure.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated mixes 5/3/8 overlays but expected symmetric 5/3/8 in specific patterns (e.g., row2: generated 3,3,3 but expected 3,8,3,3,8,3); rows 6-9: 3,8,3 repeats but expected 8,8,8 blocks with 3 edges; rows 16-20: sparse 4/9 but expected uniform 4s—pad_pattern's 0-append + 9-replace creates excess 9s.
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but broken for all-frame left (returns [] too eagerly, leading to rotations); rotate_left is neutral but unhelpful without correct base; apply_overlay positions are useful but scope too narrow (starts at 9, misses 0-8); overall program shows understanding of left->overlay flow but fails on pattern fidelity and carry-over.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken beyond flaws noted, but the previous_pattern update logic (sets to get_pattern even if rotated) creates loops of bad data—avoid in future without reset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it consists mostly of 9-fills (blank/edge) with sparse, repeating 4/3 overlays in right positions (e.g., rows 2/6/8/10 have 4,3 patterns at 9-11/15-17/21-23), suggesting over-reliance on rotation/mis-extraction from presumed left input, but lacks the structured motifs seen in training expectations (e.g., no solid blocks or symmetric 1/2/8 like Train2, instead fragmented 3/4 on 9-base).
 * Does not make sense: All rows start/end with 9s, implying heavy blank-filling or failed pattern detection (possibly test left is all-frame, triggering endless rotations of empty/3/4), but expected should mirror training variety (e.g., evolving overlays on base colors like 5/8/9); mismatches subtlety of preserving left-crop content (positions 0-8 are 9s everywhere, but training shows varied starts like 5/8/2).
 * Missing elements: No carry-over diversity (patterns stuck in 4/3 cycle, e.g., rows 4/7/12/15 repeat 9,4,3 but no 7/8/1 transforms); final 9-replace over-applies, creating uniform rows where subtle patterns (e.g., Train3's 3,8,3) expected—likely doesn't handle test's unique left sequences, leading to incorrect sparse output vs. dense expected structures.

[2025-10-03 00:09:19] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors, patterns, or elements in a bordered frame, and the task is to process the input grid to output a cleaned or transformed version of the interior puzzle content, preserving the overall structure but correctly interpreting or extracting the main visual elements while removing framing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * All inputs appear to have a consistent left border (first 6 columns) consisting of frame elements like 6's or other consistent values that frame the puzzle, which must be cropped to access the 24-column interior; however, simply cropping without further processing leaves the interior numbers unchanged, which does not match expectations.
 * Interiors contain patterns of numbers (e.g., 3's, 8's, 4's, 7's, 1's, 9's, 0's) that likely represent shapes, objects, or encoded visuals; expected outputs show transformations or replacements in these areas (e.g., blocks of 8's become mixed 4's/7's in train 1, uniform 9's become patterned 1's/2's in train 2), suggesting rules for decoding, filling, or recognizing connected components/blobs rather than literal copying.
 * Top and bottom rows often retain border-like values (e.g., 5's in train 1 and 3), indicating that horizontal borders may be part of the output or need selective preservation, while vertical frames (left/right) are fully removed; right borders (e.g., 6's in test) may also need cropping or handling.
 * Subtle patterns include non-uniform interiors: train 1 has irregular shapes with 1's and 8's that become more complex with 4's/7's; train 2 has repeating horizontal bands that resolve into vertical motifs with 1's/2's interrupting 9's; train 3 has solid blocks (5's and 4's) that embed finer 3/8 patterns, implying hierarchical structure or overlay rules.
 * Grids are consistently 20 rows by 24 columns post-crop, but inputs are likely 30 columns wide; no rotation, scaling, or dimension changes are needed, but connected regions (e.g., blobs of same numbers) may need extraction or replacement based on size, shape, or position.
 * Easy-to-miss: Uniform generated outputs (e.g., all 8's/9's in bands) ignore subtle interruptions or encodings in the original (e.g., 1's/2's as separators or holes); right-side elements like 6's in test may be frame remnants needing removal; 0's in test could be empty space or background, but without transformation, they persist incorrectly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, focused solely on left cropping; future attempts must address interior decoding (e.g., pattern recognition for shapes like letters/symbols); handle variable border thicknesses if present; ensure output matches exact expected values, not just dimensions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def crop_left_border(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Crops the left 6 columns (frame) from each row, assuming 30-column input, to yield 24-column interior.
    This is a necessary first step as it correctly removes the consistent left frame in all examples,
    but must be combined with interior processing for full correctness.
    """
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```

No other functions from the attempt; no extraction tools for blobs/objects were provided, but they would be essential for identifying and transforming patterns (e.g., connected components of numbers like 8's into decoded shapes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and removes the left border (6 columns of frame), which aligns with the positioning of main content in all training examples and produces the right dimensions (24 columns), but fails entirely on interior content by copying values verbatim without transformation.
 * Train 1: Generated a simple diagonal/rectangular shape of 3's filled with 8's and isolated 1's, but expected a more intricate pattern with 4's/7's replacing many 8's, 1's repositioned or expanded, and additional 4's/7's in non-8 areas (e.g., row 2 expected has 4's/3's mix where generated has all 3's; unknown why 8's map to 4/7 but likely shape decoding).
 * Train 2: Generated uniform horizontal bands of 8's interrupted only by 9's, but expected inserts 1's/2's in specific positions (e.g., row 0 expected starts [2,2,1,...] where generated has all 8's/9's; this misses patterned motifs like checkerboard or symbols in the 8/9 areas).
 * Train 3: Generated solid horizontal blocks of 5's (top/bottom) and 4's (middle), but expected embeds 3/8 patterns within those blocks (e.g., row 1 expected has 3/8 interruptions in 5's where generated is uniform 5's; row 6 expected mixes 3/8 in 4's area).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but naive cropping alone is insufficient and broken for the full problem (do not use without adding pattern recognition or mapping rules).
 * Extracting objects/blobs (not implemented) seems essential for future attempts to handle shape-based transformations, as generated outputs ignore connected regions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it merely crops the left 6 columns, resulting in a grid of 9's (likely background/frame), 0's (empty or interior space), 6's (right frame remnants), and scattered 2/3/4/7's, but based on training examples, this unchanged interior likely needs transformation (e.g., 9/0/6 patterns should decode into mixed numbers like 1/2/3/4/7/8 as in trains; scattered digits like 2/4 in row 2 may be part of shapes that get filled or replaced).
 * It preserves right-side 6's (e.g., column 19 in many rows), which may be a right border needing cropping (e.g., to 24 columns total, but test shows 24 values with 6's at end, suggesting incomplete frame removal); uniform 9's and 0's bands resemble train 2/3 generated failures, missing subtle embeddings (e.g., row 10 has 3's that might expand into patterns).
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exactly, but it does not make sense as a final puzzle solution since training shows interiors must be actively processed, not copied; account for potential right-cropping (e.g., remove last 0-6 columns if 6's are frame) and blob detection to handle isolated 0/3/7 as object starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where the left portion of each row (likely columns 0-5) encodes a pattern or rule that must be extracted and applied as an overlay or transformation to the cropped main content area (likely columns 6-29, producing 24 elements per row). The goal is to generate a modified output grid that matches expected transformations, involving header normalizations, pattern cycling for empty rows, and periodic overlays, but the current approach misapplies these rules leading to mismatches in pattern propagation, header extensions, and overlay positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 columns, ignoring or framing with specific values like 0,6,7; leading frames determine repetition, and non-zero values after form the core pattern, but this fails when patterns shift or cycle incorrectly across consecutive empty rows.
 * Header normalization extends initial runs of 5's to exactly 3 cells and 3's to 6 cells by overwriting subsequent cells, but this is applied universally without checking row context, leading to over-extension or incorrect starts (e.g., turning partial 5's into full 3's prematurely).
 * Overlays apply a 3-element pattern (padded/repeated if short, with 1's mapped to 4's) starting at index 9 of the crop, repeating every 6 positions for the first 3 slots of each block, but this ignores varying block structures, deeper pattern rotations (e.g., [1:] + [0] for cycles), and doesn't handle cases where patterns evolve mid-grid or interact with existing content like 8's or 9's.
 * Consecutive empty patterns (no non-frame values in left) carry the previous pattern but cycle it (e.g., rotate left by 1), resetting counter on new patterns; however, the cycle logic only triggers after >1 empty, which misses single-empty carries and fails on long sequences.
 * Crop is always row[6:30] (24 elements), assuming fixed width; outputs must preserve this length without introducing 0's unless they are part of the expected transformation.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may need to be derived from cumulative or row-spanning logic (e.g., vertical alignment across rows), 1's specifically map to 4's in overlays but not elsewhere, and certain values like 8's or 9's act as backgrounds that overlays replace selectively; empty lefts don't always cycle but may default to all-5 or all-3 headers.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show progressive shifts (e.g., 5's shrinking, 3's expanding, overlays inserting 4/7/8 blocks), suggesting rules tied to row index or global progression, not just per-row left extraction.
 * Avoid universal normalization—some rows in expected have irregular headers (e.g., single 5's or mixed 3/8 without extension); overlays may start earlier/later or apply to different strides based on pattern length.
 * 0's in left indicate frames/empties but should not propagate to output crops unless expected; test inputs have 0's in crops, which generated outputs retain incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract pattern from left 5 columns based on leading frame colors (0,6,7)."""
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    leading = 0
    i = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []  # Empty pattern
    first = left[i]
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function partially works for identifying leading repeats but fails on complex lefts with mixed non-frames; useful as a starting point for extraction but needs refinement for cycling.)

```python
def normalize_header(crop: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extend initial runs of 5 and 3 to 3 and 6 respectively by overwriting next cells."""
    crop = crop[:]  # Copy
    # Extend 5's to 3
    num5 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 5
    # Re-find and extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(crop) and crop[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    num3 = 0
    i = start3
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 3
    return crop
```
(This is broken for rows without initial 5/3 runs, as it forces extensions where expected outputs have different starts like 8's or 4's; not helpful without conditional application based on left pattern.)

```python
def apply_overlay(crop: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Apply pattern overlay starting from position 9, every 6 positions, replacing first 3."""
    p = pattern[:]
    while len(p) < 3 and p:
        p.append(p[-1])
    p = p[:3]
    result = crop[:]
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Map 1's to 4's
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(3):
            if start + k < 24:
                result[start + k] = p[k]
    return result
```
(This overlays too rigidly at fixed starts/stride, ignoring expected variations like shifting to positions 0-8 or different repeats; unhelpful for dynamic patterns, e.g., rotating 7/8 blocks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the crop as row[6:30] and handles basic pattern extraction from left, with consecutive empty logic attempting carry-over, but fails overall as all training examples are incorrect.
 * For Training 1: Rows 0-1 match expected headers exactly ([5x5 + 3x22 +5x2] and [5x4 +3x20]), but row 2 mismatches from pos 9-11 (generated 4,4,4 vs expected 3,3,3) and pos 18-20 (3,3,3 vs 4,4,4), showing overlay wrongly inserts 4's where 3's should persist; row 4 mismatches pos 10 (7 vs nothing, expected has 4,7,4 but generated shifts); row 5 major mismatch (generated 4,7,4,8x3 vs expected 5,5,3x5,8x2 + all 4's), indicating failed header shrink and wrong overlay cycle; later rows like 8-12 insert 1's/4's incorrectly where expected has 8's/3's evolving vertically; row 17 has 6's where expected has 3's/8's, suggesting pattern misderivation from left.
 * For Training 2: Almost no matches—row 0 generated [5x3,3x6,9,8x5,9x4,8x4] vs expected [2x2,1,8x2,9,2x2,1,9,8x5,9x4,8x4], wrong headers and overlays (9/8 blocks overwritten incorrectly); row 1 has 4's/2's where expected has 2's/9's, showing 1->4 map applied wrongly and pattern [4,4,2] not matching expected [2,2,2]; repetitive 4/8/9 blocks in rows 5-12 ignore expected cycling of 1/2 patterns; row 13 introduces 6's mismatched to expected 2's, indicating broken cycling for empties.
 * For Training 3: Row 0 all 5's matches, but row 1 generated [5x9,3x3,5x3,3x3,5x3,3x3] vs expected [5x15,3,8,3x2,8,3x2,8,3], wrong extension of 3's and missing 8 insertions; row 2 has 8,3,8 repeats where expected has 3,8x2,3 etc., close but shifted; rows 5-9 mismatch overlays (e.g., row 5 generated 3x6 +8,4x3 etc. vs expected 4x15,3,8x2,4x3,3,8x2), failing to propagate 4's fully; rows 15-19 repetitive 4/6 but expected all 4's, showing over-application of patterns.
 * get_pattern is somewhat helpful for simple lefts but broken for frames with embedded non-zeros or when leading != repeat count.
 * normalize_header is not helpful—overwrites too aggressively, causing header mismatches in all examples where expected has non-extended or alternative starts (e.g., direct 8's in train3).
 * apply_overlay is incorrect—fixed range(9,24,6) misses early overlays (e.g., pos 0 in some expected) and doesn't rotate patterns per row, leading to static repeats; don't use without dynamic start/stride.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of cropping and left extraction but misses vertical/global pattern evolution, conditional normalization, and flexible overlays; consecutive_empty >1 for cycling is too strict, as some expected carries happen on first empty.
 * No functions for vertical alignment or cumulative patterns, which seems essential given row-to-row progressions in expected (e.g., shrinking 5's, expanding 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it retains many 0's from the input crop (e.g., row 0 pos 9-11=0,0,9... but ends with 6,0x4, introducing artifacts not in training expecteds, which avoid 0's in structured blocks), suggesting failed overwriting or pattern application leaves empties untouched.
 * Headers are mostly [5x3,3x6] which may be right for some rows, but overlays insert inconsistent 4/6/3/9 blocks (e.g., row 1: 4,4,6,9x3,4,4,6,9,6,0,4,4,6 with lingering 0's and mismatched 6's where patterns cycle wrongly); row 4 has 3,6,4 repeats but expected likely needs full 9/6 propagation without 0's.
 * Later rows like 13-17 have 0's in pos 12-14/18 (e.g., 3,6,4,0x3,3,6,4,0,6,0,3,6,4), which looks like incomplete overlays or failed normalization, not matching clean block structures in training expecteds (e.g., no 0's, full 3/4/8/9 fills).
 * Row 26 has [5x3,3x6,4x3,9x3,4x3,4,9,6,0,4x3] with 0's and partial 6's, indicating the cycling/overlay logic breaks on long sequences, producing messy outputs unlike expected uniform transformations.
 * Overall, test output makes no sense as a solved puzzle—too many 0's and irregularities suggest the program doesn't fully transform the crop, missing core rules like complete replacement or background filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors, shapes, or symbols in a larger image) where the left margin (first 5-6 columns) of each row encodes instructions or patterns that must be extracted, processed (e.g., rotated, mapped, normalized), and overlaid onto the main body of the grid (columns 6-30, cropped to 24 elements) to complete or transform the image according to repeating or propagating rules. The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, such as extending headers, filling sections with rotated motifs, or applying cyclic overlays, while handling special cases like empty patterns or frame elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 elements of each row; elements 0,6,7 seem to act as "frame" or ignore markers that skip leading positions, but only if they don't fill the entire left side—subtlety: if the entire left is frame, return empty and rotate the previous row's pattern.
 * Empty patterns (all frame or invalid) inherit and rotate the previous row's pattern leftward (cycle shift), but this rotation must preserve length and only apply when needed; easy to miss: rotation happens before mapping/padding, and original length tracks for header normalization.
 * Mapping rule: 1 specifically maps to 4, while other values pass through—subtlety: this is likely a color/symbol substitution, but only for certain extracted elements; don't apply globally.
 * Padding: Patterns shorter than 3 are padded by repeating the last element (or 0 if empty), then truncated to exactly 3—key: this ensures consistent overlay size, but over-padding can cause repetition errors in longer sections.
 * Normalization for headers: Rows with empty patterns (original_len==0) extend leading 5's to exactly 3 positions (overwriting if needed), then extend following 3's to exactly 6 positions—subtlety: this only applies to "header" rows without patterns; it doesn't touch other numbers, and extensions stop at row length (24 after crop).
 * Overlay application: Patterns (padded to 3) are stamped starting at positions 9,15,21 (0-indexed in the 24-element cropped row), overwriting existing values—easy to miss: this creates 3 repeating sections per row, but only if pos <24; it ignores the first 9 positions (likely a fixed left area) and assumes crop starts at original index 6.
 * Grid structure: Input g has rows of at least 30 elements; output is cropped to [6:30] (24 elems) per row, height preserved; patterns propagate vertically via previous_pattern, so row dependencies are crucial—subtlety: no horizontal propagation, but vertical inheritance can create staggered or rotating motifs across rows.
 * Special numbers: 5 often acts as a header/start marker (extends to 3), 3 as a filler/extender (to 6), 8/9 as backgrounds or walls; 4,6,7 as pattern elements; 0/1/2 as placeholders or holes—key: overlays can overwrite these, but extractions must avoid frame pollution.
 * Edge cases: Full-empty rows rotate prior; leading non-frame starts pattern immediately; if leading==0, pattern is just [first]; append non-zero from rest of left—subtlety: this skips 0's in extraction but includes them in patterns sometimes, leading to 0-padding issues.
 * Overall rules: Transform preserves structure but fills/completes sections based on left cues; mismatches often from incorrect extraction (e.g., including frame), wrong rotation timing, or overlay positions; consider vertical continuity and exact length enforcement to avoid spillover.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This extracts patterns by skipping leading frame elements and building from first non-frame, appending non-zeros; useful for left-margin parsing, but buggy on full-frame or mixed 0/non-0.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cycle shift for inheritance; helpful for propagating patterns vertically, but needs careful application only on empties.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads to fixed overlay size; useful, but repetition can amplify errors if pattern is wrong.)

```python
def normalize_header(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    row = row[:]
    # Extend 5's to 3
    i = 0
    num5 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 5
    # Extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(row) and row[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    i = start3
    num3 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 3
    return row
```
(Handles header extension for empty-pattern rows; partially useful for 5/3 rules, but limited to leading sequences and doesn't handle other fillers like 8/9.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(len(p)):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Stamps pattern in sections 9-11,15-17,21-23; core for filling, but assumes p len=3 and fixed starts—helpful if positions are correct.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of left-extraction and overlay but incorrect pattern building, rotation, and normalization.
 * Train 1: Generated short/incomplete 3-extensions (e.g., first row has only four 3's then 0's, but expected 20+ 3's across sections with trailing 5's); mismatched overlays like row 5 having scattered 7/8 instead of uniform 4's, row 8 having 1's in wrong spots vs expected 4's/8's; row 9 has 1's and 4's but expected mixed 8/4/7 with 3-end; unknown why 1's appear (from unmapped extraction?) and rotations don't align vertical motifs.
 * Train 2: Generated repetitive 4's/2's/6's in overlays but ignores left patterns like 2/1/8/9; first row starts with 5/3 but expected 2/1/8/9 blocks; many rows have uniform 4's where expected cyclic 2/1/9/8 sections—missed vertical pattern variation and header omission; 0's and 9's not propagated correctly.
 * Train 3: Generated inconsistent 5/3/8 overlays with 0's and 4's, but expected structured 5-headers then 3/8 motifs in sections; row 1 has 3/8 but expected all-5 then 8's; row 6 has 3/8/3 but expected uniform 4's then 3/8/8; lower rows have 2's/4's/6's where expected all-5 or all-4—rotation and padding over-applied, frame skipping wrong.
 * get_pattern is helpful for extraction but broken: includes leading repeats incorrectly (e.g., * leading but if leading=0 just [first]), skips 0's but not always, and fails on full-frame without proper empty check.
 * rotate_left is useful but applied too broadly (e.g., on non-empties), causing pattern drift.
 * pad_pattern and map_pattern (1->4) are directionally correct but amplify errors (e.g., padding 0's leads to blank sections).
 * normalize_header only for empties but buggy: extends 5 to 3 and 3 to 6, but doesn't handle longer sequences or other numbers like 8/9; unhelpful for non-header rows.
 * apply_overlay positions (9,15,21) seem right for 3-section repeat but overwrites too much/too little, missing first 9 cols and not aligning with expected full-row fills.
 * Overall: No training passed; understanding shows vertical inheritance and sectional overlays, but misses exact extension rules, full pattern cycling, and background preservation—avoid global mapping or fixed paddings without checks.
 * Function map_pattern is simple/subtle-useful (1->4), but normalize_header is partially broken (wrong start3 calc after 5's, limited scope).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it features heavy repetition of 9's and 0's in early columns (likely unprocessed left area), with cyclic overlays of [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] in positions ~9-11/15-17/21-23 across many rows, but introduces inconsistencies like scattered 6's/3's in row 10+ and 0-blocks in rows 13-16, suggesting faulty rotation/padding on varying left inputs (e.g., test left has 9/0 mixes not extracted well).
 * It mismatches puzzle logic: Expected likely has structured 9-backgrounds with rotating 3/4/6 motifs filling sections uniformly (similar to train 2's cycles), but generated has partial overwrites (e.g., row 1 has 9,6,0 at end vs probable full pattern) and abrupt 0-rows (13-16) that should propagate prior patterns; lower rows revert to 4/3/6 cycles but with extra 6's/4's, indicating over-rotation or wrong inheritance—looks messy/incomplete, not matching vertical continuity in trainings.
 * No expected provided, but based on trainings, it should avoid 0-spillover and ensure overlays align across rows (e.g., staggering like train 1's 4/7/8); current output has too many isolated 6's and unnormalized headers, so incorrect—account for 9/6 as potential frames or mappers to fix.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (first 5 cells per row) encodes patterns or instructions (possibly frames, leading indicators, or sequences) that determine transformations or overlays applied to the main content area (crop from index 6 to 29, output as 24 elements). The goal is to process each row independently or with carry-over (e.g., rotation from previous patterns) to produce a modified grid matching expected visual structures, with final blank/edge filling using 9.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Left side (row[0:5]) uses a "frame" set {0,6,7} to detect leading non-content (e.g., borders or spacers); count leading frame elements to determine repetition of the first non-frame value, then append non-zero values from the remaining left cells—subtlety: if all left is frame or empty pattern, rotate from previous row's pattern, but this can propagate errors across rows.
 * Patterns are padded to exactly 3 elements (repeat last or use 0 if empty), then mapped (1 becomes 4, others unchanged) before overlay—easy to miss: overlay applies only to specific positions in crop (starting at index 9, then every 6 steps: 9-11, 15-17, 21-23), suggesting a 4x6 subgrid or column-wise insertion, but ignores earlier crop indices (0-8 stay as-is).
 * Carry-over via previous_pattern update only when a new pattern is detected, else use rotated version—subtlety: rotation is left-cyclic (p[1:] + [p[0]]), which may simulate shifting motifs, but fails if initial patterns are wrong, leading to cascading mismatches.
 * Final post-processing replaces 0 or 6 with 9 across the entire output row (not just crop), implying 0/6 are blanks/edges to be filled uniformly—key: this happens after overlay, so overlays can introduce non-9 values, but expected outputs show structured fills (e.g., solid 3s, 8s, or mixed 4/7/8) rather than sparse insertions.
 * Grid is 20-24 rows high, each row 30+ elements internally but cropped/output to 24; patterns seem to represent colors/shapes (e.g., 3=fill, 4=border, 7/8=patterns, 1=transformed to 4), with expectations showing symmetric or repeating motifs (e.g., rows of uniform 3s, checker-like 4/7/8).
 * Subtle across examples: Training 1 has evolving patterns (3s to 4/7/8 overlays on 3-base), Training 2 cycles 1/2 motifs into 9-base with 4/2 overlays, Training 3 mixes 5-base with 3/8 and 4/2 overlays—common: left encodes short sequences (1-3 elems), but program over-repeats or mis-rotates, leading to uniform 9-fills where structure expected.
 * Easy to miss: No global grid interactions (row-independent except pattern carry), but test input lacks provided left/crop details, so assumptions about input structure (e.g., all-9 base) may fail; outputs must preserve some original crop content while overlaying.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame 'leading' times
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function attempts to extract repeating motifs from left, useful for identifying sequence starts after frames, but flawed in repetition logic and empty handling—keep but fix for non-zero appends and frame edge cases.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cyclic shift for pattern carry-over; helpful for simulating rotation in multi-row motifs, but only useful if base patterns are correct.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads short patterns by repetition or 0; essential for consistent 3-element overlays, but 0-padding may introduce unwanted blanks before final 9-fill.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    p = pad_pattern(pattern)
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Transform 1 to 4 (possible color/shape map)
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):  # Overlays at 9-11, 15-17, 21-23 in crop
        for k in range(3):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Core overlay logic targeting right-side columns; helpful for inserting patterns into specific sub-areas, but misses left crop (0-8) and assumes crop len=24—adjust range if input varies.)

(The main program function ties these together with previous_pattern tracking and final 9-replacement; partially helpful for structure, but broken in pattern propagation and overlay scope.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs showing excessive 9-fills and misapplied overlays (e.g., sparse 4/3/7/8 insertions where expected solid blocks of 3/8 or repeating 4/7/8 patterns).
 * What worked: Basic left extraction via get_pattern correctly identifies some non-frame starts (e.g., in Train1 row3, detects 3 after leading, overlays 4s matching expected positions); overlay positions (9+) align with right-side motifs in partial matches (e.g., Train1 rows 3-5 have correct 4/7/8 spots but wrong values/context); final 9-replacement fills blanks appropriately in uniform areas (e.g., Train1 row1 ends with 9s like expected 3/5 but mismatched).
 * What didn't work: Pattern repetition over-applies leading count (e.g., Train1 row1 generates [5,5,5,...] but expected uniform 3/5 without repetition); rotation/empty handling propagates wrong patterns (e.g., Train1 rows 9-16 show repeated 4/1/8 but expected varied 4/7/8/1 with 3-edges); mapping 1->4 is inconsistent (Train2 expects 1/2 preserved in left, but overlays 4/2 wrongly); ignores original crop content fully in some rows, leading to all-9 where structure needed (e.g., Train3 rows 10-14 generate uniform 2s/4s but expected all-5s or 4-blocks).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated has fragmented 4/7/8 (e.g., row6: 7,4,4,8,8,8 but expected solid 4s); row9: 4,4,4,1,1,1 but expected 8,8,8,4,4,4 with trailing 8/3; row17: 4,4,9,8,8,8 but expected 8,8,8,4,7,4; unknown why 1s appear untransformed in some spots.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated cycles 4/2 overlays on 9-base but expected left-side 1/2/8 motifs with right 9-fills (e.g., row1: generated all-9/4/2 but expected 2,2,1,8,8,9,...); rows 14-20 show repeated 4/9 but expected repeating 2/2/1 blocks; function apply_overlay overwrites too aggressively, losing original 8/9 structure.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated mixes 5/3/8 overlays but expected symmetric 5/3/8 in specific patterns (e.g., row2: generated 3,3,3 but expected 3,8,3,3,8,3); rows 6-9: 3,8,3 repeats but expected 8,8,8 blocks with 3 edges; rows 16-20: sparse 4/9 but expected uniform 4s—pad_pattern's 0-append + 9-replace creates excess 9s.
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but broken for all-frame left (returns [] too eagerly, leading to rotations); rotate_left is neutral but unhelpful without correct base; apply_overlay positions are useful but scope too narrow (starts at 9, misses 0-8); overall program shows understanding of left->overlay flow but fails on pattern fidelity and carry-over.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken beyond flaws noted, but the previous_pattern update logic (sets to get_pattern even if rotated) creates loops of bad data—avoid in future without reset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it consists mostly of 9-fills (blank/edge) with sparse, repeating 4/3 overlays in right positions (e.g., rows 2/6/8/10 have 4,3 patterns at 9-11/15-17/21-23), suggesting over-reliance on rotation/mis-extraction from presumed left input, but lacks the structured motifs seen in training expectations (e.g., no solid blocks or symmetric 1/2/8 like Train2, instead fragmented 3/4 on 9-base).
 * Does not make sense: All rows start/end with 9s, implying heavy blank-filling or failed pattern detection (possibly test left is all-frame, triggering endless rotations of empty/3/4), but expected should mirror training variety (e.g., evolving overlays on base colors like 5/8/9); mismatches subtlety of preserving left-crop content (positions 0-8 are 9s everywhere, but training shows varied starts like 5/8/2).
 * Missing elements: No carry-over diversity (patterns stuck in 4/3 cycle, e.g., rows 4/7/12/15 repeat 9,4,3 but no 7/8/1 transforms); final 9-replace over-applies, creating uniform rows where subtle patterns (e.g., Train3's 3,8,3) expected—likely doesn't handle test's unique left sequences, leading to incorrect sparse output vs. dense expected structures.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 00:28:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where patterns or symbols extracted from a left border (first few columns of each row) are used to overlay, rotate, or decode elements in the main body of the grid, likely representing some form of symbolic or patterned transformation across rows, with repeating motifs like numbers 3,4,7,8 in example 1, 1,2,9 in example 2, and 3,8 in example 3.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The left border (first 5 columns per row) seems to encode patterns, but leading frames like 0,6,7 may indicate no new pattern or continuation, requiring detection of the first non-frame value to start extraction; however, this leads to incorrect overlays if rotation or padding is misapplied.
 * Patterns are short sequences (e.g., 3 elements like [4,7,8] or rotations thereof) that get applied periodically across the row (e.g., every 6 positions starting from index 9 in the cropped grid), but must preserve or interact with existing grid values rather than fully overwriting, as seen in mismatches where overlays ignore underlying structures.
 * Rotation of previous patterns occurs when a row has no new pattern (all frame values), but the rotation direction, frequency, or condition is off—e.g., in example 1, rotations should produce specific sequences like [4,4,4] then [7,4,4] but instead generate incorrect [4,4,7] variants.
 * Mapping rules are subtle: e.g., 1 maps to 4 in some contexts, but not universally, and padding with repeats (e.g., last value) fails when patterns vary in length or when empty patterns should propagate differently.
 * Grid cropping ignores the first 6 columns consistently, assuming they are borders, but this may crop too much or too little, leading to positional errors in overlays (e.g., applying at starts 9,15,21 but missing alignments).
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may reset or cycle independently per "section" of the grid (e.g., upper vs lower in example 1), and empty rows or all-5/8/9 borders indicate solid fills without overlays; also, some rows in expectations show blended values (e.g., 4's overlaying on 3's but retaining shapes), suggesting non-destructive application.
 * Across attempts, failures in propagating patterns across blank left borders cause cascading errors, like in example 2 where rotations should cycle [1,2] motifs but produce static 4's; example 3 shows failure to handle vertical alignments or section breaks.
 * Considerations: Grids have consistent width (24 after crop?), height varies (20 rows in ex1/2, but code assumes full len(g)); numbers represent colors/symbols (e.g., 3=background, 4=pattern element, 7/8=extensions); test input has repeating cycles in left (e.g., [4,3,6] rotations) suggesting a cyclic pattern puzzle.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def crop_left_border(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[6:30] for row in grid]  # Useful for isolating main body, but 30 may be too wide—grids seem 24-30 cols; adjust if borders vary.
```

```python
def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    pattern = [first] * i if i > 0 else [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern  # Partially helpful for skipping frames, but broken: prepends repeats incorrectly (e.g., for [0,0,4] should be [4], not [4,4]); ignores non-zero frames.
```

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return p
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]  # Helpful for cycling patterns, but may need right rotation or conditional (e.g., only on empty); works for short lists like [4,7,8] -> [7,8,4].
```

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    p = p[:3]
    while len(p) < 3:
        p.append(p[-1] if p else 0)
    return p  # Somewhat helpful for standardizing to 3 elements, but unhelpful if patterns are >3 or need exact lengths; causes repeats where expectations vary (e.g., [4] pads to [4,4,4] but sometimes should be [4,0,0]).
```

```python
def map_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Specific to mapping 1->4, helpful for example 1/2 where 1 appears, but irrelevant/broken for example 3 (no 1's) and test (no 1's); don't use broadly.
```

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(3):
            pos = start + k

                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result  # Core but broken: Overwrites absolutely without blending (e.g., expectations show partial fills like 4 on 3 but retaining 3's); starts at 9 too late/ignores offsets; step 6 assumes fixed motif width.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, with no rows matching expectations, indicating fundamental misunderstanding of pattern extraction, rotation, and overlay logic.
 * In training example 1: Generated overlays incorrect from row 5 onward—e.g., row 5 has [4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4] vs expected [4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4] (wait, similar but row 6 generated [8,8,7,4,4,4,8,8,8,7,4,4,8,8,8,7,4,4] vs expected all 4's, missing full fill; row 8 generated [4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4] vs expected [8,8,8,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4]—rotation off by one, and no blending with 8's; lower rows like 12 generated [1,1,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,8,...], mapping 1->4 but positions wrong; overall, too many 4/7/8 mixes where expectations have solid sections or different rotations (e.g., row 18 expected all 4's overlay but generated partial 3's).
 * In training example 2: Generated mostly static 4's and incorrect 2/6 inserts—e.g., row 1 [8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,2,8,8,8,4,4,2,9,9,8,4,4,2] vs expected [2,2,2,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8] (ignores left pattern [2,2,2] entirely, overlays 4/2 wrongly; rows 13-20 generate cycling 4/6 but expectations cycle [2,2,1]/[1,2,1] motifs without 4/6, suggesting no mapping needed and rotation direction wrong—generated left-rotates to 6/4/3 but expected right-cycles 1/2 patterns).
 * In training example 3: Generated inconsistent overlays and wrong fills—e.g., row 1 all 5's vs expected partial 8's on right; row 5 [3,3,8,5,...] vs expected [3,8,3,5,...] (positions swapped); row 6 [2,2,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,...] (wrong pattern start, 2 instead of 8); lower rows like 10 all 2's vs expected all 4's (rotation/padding fails to switch); function get_pattern prepends wrongly for left borders like [0,3,8], producing [3,8,3?] instead of [3,8]; crop_left_border assumes fixed 6-col border but example 3 has varying 5's/8's that should propagate as fills.
 * Missed rotation on empty left borders consistently, causing static patterns (e.g., ex1 rows 12-13 stay [1,1,1] mapped to [4,4,4] but should rotate to [8,1,1] etc.); apply_overlay overwrites without checking existing values, leading to loss of background like 3's in ex1.
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but broken for non-leading patterns (e.g., skips too many or repeats first wrongly); map_pattern is unhelpful/irrelevant for ex3 and test (no 1's, causes false 4's); pad_pattern forces 3-len but expectations have variable (e.g., ex2 [1,2] cycles without padding).
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better left parsing; previous logic assumes universal 3-element motifs but ex2 has 3-element [1,2,1] that repeats without rotation in blocks.
 * Train 1 mismatches in mid-section (rows 6-9) where generated has scattered 4/7/8 but expected solid 4's then 7-interspersed, unknown reason but likely wrong rotation trigger.
 * Train 2 has complete failure to detect [1,2,1]/[2,2,1] from left, generating 4's instead—mapping over-applied.
 * Train 3 upper half generated partial 3/8 but expected mirrored/aligned 3/8 blocks; lower half wrong fills (2's vs 4's/5's).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears nonsensical—e.g., rows 0-3 cycle [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] overlays starting at pos 9, but with inconsistent 0's and 6's in left/mid (row 0: [9's,0's,9's,6,0's]; row 10: inserts 3's wrongly at end); repeating blocks (rows 5-7 mirror 1-3 but expectations likely need cyclic rotation without overwriting 9's/0's fully, as test left has rotating [4,3,6] suggesting output should propagate that cycle across right sections without introducing extra 3's/4's in non-pattern spots (e.g., row 13 all 0's base but overlays [6,4,3] cleanly); lower rows (14-17) have 0-base with overlays, but row 18+ revert to 9-base with cycles, mismatched to expected solid sections or blended 0/6/9; overall, too many forced 4's/mappings where test has no 1's, and positions like pos 20-23 have erratic 0/3/4/6 vs likely clean cycle [4,3,6,9's]; does not account for section breaks (e.g., row 13-17 as 0-block needing different handling), making it look like over-rotated junk rather than patterned output.

[2025-10-03 00:29:20] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train example (inputs 1-3 and their outputs) and demonstrate clear, repeatable effects or relationships (e.g., one element's property influencing another's position, color, or transformation). I focused only on consistent patterns across all three pairs, ignoring unique or inconsistent elements (e.g., varying small Yellow placements that do not repeat identically, or test inputs which lack outputs for verification). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Unknown or non-consistent effects are noted as such.

1. **Left-side Pink frame (holes=1) interacts with top-left small pixel cluster via overlap/position**:
   - The Pink shape (holes=1, bbox starting at x=0, spanning full height ~[0,0,5,19], ~42 pixels) consistently overlaps with the top-left small cluster (e.g., Dark Red/Yellow in input 1, Blue/Red in input 2, Green/Maroon in input 3).
   - Effect: The Pink's fixed left position contains or bounds the cluster's initial placement. In all outputs, Pink is absent, while the cluster's elements are redistributed into detailed small-pixel patterns (1-3 pixels each) across the canvas, suggesting the Pink acts as a consistent "container" that releases or relocates the cluster without altering its total pixel count (~6-9 pixels from cluster preserved in output small elements). No color change from Pink itself.

2. **Top-left small pixel cluster color -> output small-pixel pattern color**:
   - The top-left cluster (small shapes, 1-6 pixels each, positioned ~[1,1,3,3] or adjacent, total ~6-9 pixels) uses specific colors (Dark Red/Yellow in 1, Blue/Red in 2, Green/Maroon in 3).
   - Effect: This color directly determines the primary color(s) of the numerous small (1-pixel) detailed elements forming patterns in all outputs (e.g., Dark Red/Yellow singles in output 1, Blue/Red singles in output 2, Green/Maroon-influenced elements in output 3). Pixel count of the cluster is roughly preserved in the output pattern's small elements (e.g., ~20-30 small 1-pixel items, but core colors match). Position of cluster influences initial "seed" positions for output patterns (e.g., top/mid placements in outputs mirror input cluster's y~1-3). No holes in cluster itself.

3. **Large colored blocks (high pixels >100) position -> output block repositioning/transformation**:
   - Large blocks (e.g., Green/Orange/Maroon in 1, Maroon/Light Blue in 2, Orange/Yellow in 3; bbox spanning >10 units in x/y, pixels 100-226) consistently occupy right/mid canvas in inputs (~x=6+).
   - Effect: Their horizontal/vertical orientation and color are preserved, but position shifts leftward (e.g., to x=0-5) and width expands to fill canvas (~x=0-23) in all outputs. This interacts with the Pink frame's left boundary, "releasing" blocks to align against it. Some blocks split (e.g., Maroon in output 1 into two parts; Light Blue in output 2 combined/shifted). Pixel count decreases slightly (~10-20% loss, possibly due to overlap resolution), but color and hole properties (if present) carry over without change. Consistent across all: no new colors introduced from these blocks.

4. **Bottom small Dark Red pair (pixels=2) position -> output bottom-row small elements placement**:
   - A small Dark Red shape (pixels=2, bbox ~[2,17-19,*], vertical or horizontal) appears at bottom-left/mid in all inputs.
   - Effect: Influences placement of 2-4 small (1-pixel) Dark Red (or similar) elements along the bottom row (y=18-19) in outputs 1 and 2, with approximate x-shift rightward (e.g., to x=16-23). In output 3, effect is less direct (no exact match, but Green elements appear bottom-adjacent instead—possible color substitution from top cluster, unknown consistency). Total pixels=2 preserved. Interacts with large blocks by avoiding overlap in outputs.

5. **Hole count in large input shapes (holes=1) -> output shape hole modification**:
   - Large shapes with holes=1 (e.g., Green/Maroon in input 1, Pink in all, none other in 2, Pink only in 3) consistently have holes.
   - Effect: In outputs, these map to shapes with holes=0 (e.g., Green/Maroon in output 1) or increased holes (e.g., Yellow holes=17 in output 1, possibly from filled/modified input hole; Maroon holes=1 in output 3 from input Pink). Suggests holes "propagate" or get filled by small cluster elements, reducing to 0 or multiplying in the repositioned block. Pixel count of holed shapes decreases (~20-50%) consistently. Unknown: Exact trigger for increase vs. elimination (not consistent in count change across all).

### Notes on Limitations
- No consistent interactions found for: Small Yellow positions (vary too much, no repeatable effect); specific bbox edges/silhouettes (not uniform); color-to-hole transformations (e.g., Yellow never consistently creates holes); test inputs (lack outputs, so unverified—e.g., dual Pinks in test 1 may alter frame interaction, unknown).
- Several transformations (e.g., exact pixel redistribution within patterns, total canvas filling) are unknown or inconsistent (e.g., varying band orientations in input 3 vs. others), so not included.
- All listed connections are derived solely from bbox overlaps, color matches, pixel counts, and positional shifts observable in the data; no semantic or shape-specific meanings assumed.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train example (inputs 1-3 and their outputs) and demonstrate clear, repeatable effects or relationships (e.g., one element's property influencing another's position, color, or transformation). I focused only on consistent patterns across all three pairs, ignoring unique or inconsistent elements (e.g., varying small Yellow placements that do not repeat identically, or test inputs which lack outputs for verification). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Unknown or non-consistent effects are noted as such.

1. **Left-side Pink frame (holes=1) interacts with top-left small pixel cluster via overlap/position**:
   - The Pink shape (holes=1, bbox starting at x=0, spanning full height ~[0,0,5,19], ~42 pixels) consistently overlaps with the top-left small cluster (e.g., Dark Red/Yellow in input 1, Blue/Red in input 2, Green/Maroon in input 3).
   - Effect: The Pink's fixed left position contains or bounds the cluster's initial placement. In all outputs, Pink is absent, while the cluster's elements are redistributed into detailed small-pixel patterns (1-3 pixels each) across the canvas, suggesting the Pink acts as a consistent "container" that releases or relocates the cluster without altering its total pixel count (~6-9 pixels from cluster preserved in output small elements). No color change from Pink itself.

2. **Top-left small pixel cluster color -> output small-pixel pattern color**:
   - The top-left cluster (small shapes, 1-6 pixels each, positioned ~[1,1,3,3] or adjacent, total ~6-9 pixels) uses specific colors (Dark Red/Yellow in 1, Blue/Red in 2, Green/Maroon in 3).
   - Effect: This color directly determines the primary color(s) of the numerous small (1-pixel) detailed elements forming patterns in all outputs (e.g., Dark Red/Yellow singles in output 1, Blue/Red singles in output 2, Green/Maroon-influenced elements in output 3). Pixel count of the cluster is roughly preserved in the output pattern's small elements (e.g., ~20-30 small 1-pixel items, but core colors match). Position of cluster influences initial "seed" positions for output patterns (e.g., top/mid placements in outputs mirror input cluster's y~1-3). No holes in cluster itself.

3. **Large colored blocks (high pixels >100) position -> output block repositioning/transformation**:
   - Large blocks (e.g., Green/Orange/Maroon in 1, Maroon/Light Blue in 2, Orange/Yellow in 3; bbox spanning >10 units in x/y, pixels 100-226) consistently occupy right/mid canvas in inputs (~x=6+).
   - Effect: Their horizontal/vertical orientation and color are preserved, but position shifts leftward (e.g., to x=0-5) and width expands to fill canvas (~x=0-23) in all outputs. This interacts with the Pink frame's left boundary, "releasing" blocks to align against it. Some blocks split (e.g., Maroon in output 1 into two parts; Light Blue in output 2 combined/shifted). Pixel count decreases slightly (~10-20% loss, possibly due to overlap resolution), but color and hole properties (if present) carry over without change. Consistent across all: no new colors introduced from these blocks.

4. **Bottom small Dark Red pair (pixels=2) position -> output bottom-row small elements placement**:
   - A small Dark Red shape (pixels=2, bbox ~[2,17-19,*], vertical or horizontal) appears at bottom-left/mid in all inputs.
   - Effect: Influences placement of 2-4 small (1-pixel) Dark Red (or similar) elements along the bottom row (y=18-19) in outputs 1 and 2, with approximate x-shift rightward (e.g., to x=16-23). In output 3, effect is less direct (no exact match, but Green elements appear bottom-adjacent instead—possible color substitution from top cluster, unknown consistency). Total pixels=2 preserved. Interacts with large blocks by avoiding overlap in outputs.

5. **Hole count in large input shapes (holes=1) -> output shape hole modification**:
   - Large shapes with holes=1 (e.g., Green/Maroon in input 1, Pink in all, none other in 2, Pink only in 3) consistently have holes.
   - Effect: In outputs, these map to shapes with holes=0 (e.g., Green/Maroon in output 1) or increased holes (e.g., Yellow holes=17 in output 1, possibly from filled/modified input hole; Maroon holes=1 in output 3 from input Pink). Suggests holes "propagate" or get filled by small cluster elements, reducing to 0 or multiplying in the repositioned block. Pixel count of holed shapes decreases (~20-50%) consistently. Unknown: Exact trigger for increase vs. elimination (not consistent in count change across all).

### Notes on Limitations
- No consistent interactions found for: Small Yellow positions (vary too much, no repeatable effect); specific bbox edges/silhouettes (not uniform); color-to-hole transformations (e.g., Yellow never consistently creates holes); test inputs (lack outputs, so unverified—e.g., dual Pinks in test 1 may alter frame interaction, unknown).
- Several transformations (e.g., exact pixel redistribution within patterns, total canvas filling) are unknown or inconsistent (e.g., varying band orientations in input 3 vs. others), so not included.
- All listed connections are derived solely from bbox overlaps, color matches, pixel counts, and positional shifts observable in the data; no semantic or shape-specific meanings assumed.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 00:46:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of input grids (2D lists of integers representing colored pixels, likely 0=background, 1-9=colors) into output grids that follow specific spatial and structural rules derived from patterns in the examples. The transformations preserve certain elements like large colored blocks, small clusters, and holes while removing frames, redistributing pixels, and adjusting positions/sizes to fit a standard 20x24 canvas, often reducing complexity or pixel density.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Inputs appear to have a left-side "pink frame" (possibly color 6 or background with holes=1 property) spanning ~6 columns that must be removed by shifting the main content left, but without losing overlap or cluster details—subtlety: the frame might not always be uniform, and ignoring it can cause misalignment in subsequent steps.
 * Top-left small pixel clusters (1-5 pixels, colors like 3,4,5) need to be extracted, their colors inferred, and redistributed into sparse 1-3 pixel patterns across the top rows or canvas edges, approximating original pixel count but not exactly—easy to miss: redistribution should avoid overwriting large blocks and preserve color variety, not just cycle through one color.
 * Large colored blocks (e.g., solid regions of 4,5,8,9) must be repositioned leftward (slicing and expanding to fill ~x=0-23), split/combined if needed, and reduced in pixel count by 10-20% through overlaps or trimming, while maintaining color and hole properties (holes=0 or increased via filling)—subtlety: expansion shouldn't fill gaps with arbitrary colors (e.g., propagating previous color blindly); instead, resolve overlaps by priority (e.g., foreground over background) and ensure no uniform filling with a single color like 3.
 * Bottom small dark red elements (color 7, often 2-4 pixels in pairs) from input bottom rows should be placed/shifted rightward into the output's bottom 1-2 rows, typically 2-4 instances—key: count and position based on input occurrences, but avoid overplacing or ignoring row overlaps.
 * Shapes with holes (especially large ones with holes=1) need modification: map to outputs with holes=0 or more, propagate/fill using nearby cluster colors, and reduce pixel count by 20-50% via overwriting or trimming—subtlety: filling shouldn't use arbitrary colors (e.g., hard-coded 3); instead, use context from input (e.g., green=3 or 5), and avoid global overwrites that turn everything uniform.
 * Overall canvas is consistently 20 rows x 24 columns; background is often 3 (light green?) or 0, but outputs mix backgrounds strategically—easy to miss: preserve asymmetry and patterns (e.g., interspersed 1's,2's for holes or dividers); pixel reduction is approximate, not exact; rules interact (e.g., redistribution after frame removal, before block repositioning).
 * Common pitfalls: Over-filling with background color 3 (seen in all attempts, creating solid top rows); introducing 0's in test output (likely invalid, as expected outputs avoid raw 0's); ignoring hole propagation (e.g., 1's in expected as hole markers); not handling variable block sizes/splits (e.g., expected has dotted patterns like 4-7-4, not solid blocks).
 * Considerations across attempts: Rules must be applied sequentially but with input references preserved (e.g., don't modify g in place); count pixels/holes accurately (e.g., sum non-0/6 in regions); handle no-cluster cases gracefully; subtle color mappings (e.g., 7= dark red, 6=pink/frame, 8/9=large blocks, 4/5=medium shapes).

* Note: extract_large_blocks is a helpful skeleton but needs full flood-fill implementation for accuracy (current program lacks this, leading to blind slicing).
* count_bottom_elements is useful and partially correct in the original place_bottom_dark_red, but ignores rightward shift logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, producing grids with excessive uniform 3's in top 4 rows (generated solid [3]*24, expected has patterned 5's,3's,4's,2's,1's), indicating broken remove_pink_frame or initial out creation—likely assumes wrong width (out_w = w-6) without padding to 24 cols.
 * redistribute_top_left_cluster worked partially in extracting colors but failed in placement: cycles colors into fixed starts [0,6,12,18] creating repetitive 1-3 pixel groups, but overwrites large areas incorrectly (e.g., Train1 generated scattered 3's/5's/4's in top, expected has structured top-left 5's block); num_pix logic is arbitrary and doesn't approximate count.
 * reposition_large_blocks is broken: simulates expansion by propagating colors left-to-right (filling 0's with prev), but introduces uniform fills (e.g., Train1 has solid 3's propagating, expected has irregular 8's/4's with 7's holes); pixel loss via arbitrary 10% overwrite to neighbor is unhelpful and creates artifacts (e.g., Train2 solid 8/9 blocks without 1/2 dividers); doesn't actually split/combine or handle overlaps properly.
 * place_bottom_dark_red partially works: counts bottom 7's correctly but places too many (min(4,max(2,count))) in fixed right position (start_j=24-num_place), duplicating in two rows—Train1 placed [7,7] at end but expected has scattered 7's integrated into patterns; Train3 placed [7,7] but expected has no bottom 7's, showing over-placement when input lacks them.
 * modify_shape_holes is unhelpful/broken: hard-codes fill to 3 (green), overwrites ~20% non-zero globally without hole detection, leading to uniform reduction (e.g., Train1 overwrote to 3's everywhere, expected preserves detailed 1's/7's; Train2/3 similar uniform 4's/5's); ignores input holes=1 mapping, causing loss of structure (e.g., expected holes via 1's or gaps not filled arbitrarily).
 * Overall: Program assumes fixed 6-col frame removal without verification (works if present, but test has no clear frame); sequential application loses input context (e.g., g not passed consistently); no object extraction, so rules are blind operations—essential for handling variable inputs; Train1 mismatches blob shapes (e.g., expected complex 4-7-8 weave, generated solid 8's with wrong 1's); Train2 misses small 1/2 patterns (generated solid 8/9, expected dotted 2-1-2 dividers); Train3 ignores top 5's patterning (generated solid 5's row, expected interspersed 3/8 holes); subtle: all generated have trailing 3's on right, expected fills canvas fully without them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Top 6 rows are solid 3's (likely from unhandled empty space post-frame removal or bad init), while expected should start with patterned large blocks (e.g., similar to Train3's top 5's with 8's holes)—this uniform fill ignores any top clusters. Middle has solid 9's blocks (rows 6-12,18-31? but grid is 20x24, output shows 32 rows? likely formatting error, but assumes solid expansion without splits/holes). Rows 13-16 have 0's (raw background, invalid as expected avoids 0's, using 3 instead), breaking continuity. Bottom has 6's blocks with stray 4's and 7's (e.g., row 30 has 6,6,4,4,6,6; rows 31-32 have 7's), but placement seems arbitrary—not right-shifted bottom 7's, and 6's (pink?) shouldn't persist post-frame removal. Overall, lacks reduction (solid blocks > expected sparse), no hole filling (0's unfilled), and doesn't match expected style of integrated patterns (e.g., 9's with 6/7/4 interspersions); test input has vertical 9's tower left, horizontal 6's right/mid, bottom 0's and 7's—output should shift 9's left, redistribute any top clusters into top, fill 0's with 3 or clusters, place 2-4 7's bottom-right, reduce 9/6 density by 20%.

[2025-10-03 00:46:43] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties (e.g., position via bbox y-coordinates, color, holes, pixel count) and components (e.g., small vs. large blobs) that show clear effects or dependencies in transformations from input to output. Only consistent patterns are included; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., those without changes or effects) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Where a transformation cannot be explained with the available data (e.g., exact mechanics), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Small left-side blobs (bbox x-start <6, pixels ≤17) y-position → large right-side components (bbox x-start ≥6, pixels ≥46) row transformation (bbox y-range)**  
   - Consistent effect: The y-coordinates of small blobs directly influence which rows (y-ranges) of large components are modified, expanded, or newly formed in the output. Small blobs at specific y act as "triggers" for row-level changes in large components.  
     - Train 1: Small blobs at y=2–3 (top) and y=15–19 (bottom) → output large Green/Maroon/Yellow modified in top (y=0–9) and bottom (y=9–19) rows.  
     - Train 2: Small blobs clustered at y=1–3, 5–10, 13, 17–18 → output Red/Blue/Maroon/Light Blue modified or added in matching row clusters (y=0–2, 3–8, 9–14, 15–19).  
     - Train 3: Small blobs at y=1–3 (top), 6–10, 13, 18 (bottom) → output Maroon/Orange/Yellow modified in top (y=0–9) and bottom (y=10–19) rows.  
   - No exceptions; y-alignment is exact or adjacent across all examples.

2. **Small left-side blobs color → introduced or changed color in output small/medium blobs (pixels 1–12) within affected rows**  
   - Consistent effect: Colors from small input blobs appear or dominate in new/expanded small or medium output blobs in the rows they trigger (from interaction 1). This suggests color "propagation" from left small blobs to output details.  
     - Train 1: Input small Dark Red/Yellow → output small Dark Red (many p=1) and Yellow (p=1) in triggered rows.  
     - Train 2: Input small Red/Blue/Yellow → output small Red (p=6–12) and Blue (p=1–2) in triggered rows (Yellow propagation unknown, as it does not appear directly).  
     - Train 3: Input small Green/Maroon/Red/Yellow/Dark Red → output small Green (p=1–3) and Maroon-integrated elements in triggered rows (Red/Dark Red propagation unknown, as they do not appear directly).  
   - Pixels in these output blobs are typically 1–12, matching input small scale; consistent color influence, though some inputs (e.g., Yellow in train 2) have unknown direct mapping.

3. **Small left-side blobs pixel count and holes (always 0) → modification of holes in large right-side components**  
   - Consistent effect: Presence and density (pixel count) of small blobs in a row trigger hole creation, reduction, or alteration in large components' affected rows (from interaction 1). Input small blobs have holes=0, but correlate with output hole changes.  
     - Train 1: 3 small blobs (total p=4, clustered top/bottom) → large Green holes=1→0, new Yellow holes=17 in affected rows.  
     - Train 2: 10 small blobs (total p=11, spread across rows) → all large Maroon/Light Blue remain holes=0, but new medium Red/Blue have holes=0 (no new holes created).  
     - Train 3: 5 small blobs (total p=20, top/bottom) → new large Maroon holes=1 in top affected rows (original large Orange/Yellow holes=0 preserved).  
   - Effect is consistent (holes only change in triggered rows), but exact rule (e.g., pixel density threshold for hole creation) is unknown.

4. **Large right-side components original color and pixel count → preservation or partial transfer to output large components (pixels ≥16)**  
   - Consistent effect: Large input components' colors and approximate pixel counts are retained or split into output large components, but only in non-triggered rows (unaffected by small blobs) or as bases for modification. Small blobs do not fully override but adjust these.  
     - Train 1: Input large Green (p=183, holes=1), Maroon (p=226, holes=1), Orange (p=46) → output large Green (p=130, holes=0), Maroon (p=94+29=123, holes=0), Orange (p=46 preserved exactly).  
     - Train 2: Input large Maroon (p=100×3+80=380 total), Light Blue (p=100×2=200) → output large Maroon (p=100+80+12+19+18=229 partial), Light Blue (p=100+55+6+3=164 partial).  
     - Train 3: Input large Orange (p=120×2=240), Yellow (p=120×2=240) → output large Orange (p=75+6+120=201 partial), Yellow (p=78+120=198 partial).  
   - Pixel counts are not exactly preserved (often reduced by 20–50%), but colors and scale are; interaction with small blobs (from 1–2) causes the reduction/splitting in affected rows (exact loss mechanism unknown).

### Notes on Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Unknown transformations**: Exact mechanics for pixel count reduction in large components (e.g., why train 1 Orange p=46 is preserved exactly while others decrease) cannot be explained from the data; it may involve bbox overlap or edges, but no consistent pattern emerges. Color mappings for some small blobs (e.g., Yellow → no direct output in train 2) are inconsistent or unknown.
- **No interaction or inconsistent**: The Pink component (holes=1, left bbox [0,0,5/7,19/29], p=42–68) appears in all inputs but never in outputs and shows no effect on other components (e.g., no row/color/hole changes tied to its position). It is isolated/static and excluded. Blue in train 1 input (p=16–17, not "small") has no consistent effect across examples. Position x-changes (left-to-right shifts) occur but are not tied to a specific property consistently. Shapes/silhouettes (e.g., edges from bbox width/height) show no obvious consistent interaction with movement or color.
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Single-pixel accents without y-alignment to large changes (none observed consistently). Elements not present in all examples (e.g., Light Blue only in train 2) are not included. No semantic meanings (e.g., "squiggles") can be identified from bbox/pixels alone.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 00:49:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties (e.g., position via bbox y-coordinates, color, holes, pixel count) and components (e.g., small vs. large blobs) that show clear effects or dependencies in transformations from input to output. Only consistent patterns are included; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., those without changes or effects) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Where a transformation cannot be explained with the available data (e.g., exact mechanics), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Small left-side blobs (bbox x-start <6, pixels ≤17) y-position → large right-side components (bbox x-start ≥6, pixels ≥46) row transformation (bbox y-range)**  
   - Consistent effect: The y-coordinates of small blobs directly influence which rows (y-ranges) of large components are modified, expanded, or newly formed in the output. Small blobs at specific y act as "triggers" for row-level changes in large components.  
     - Train 1: Small blobs at y=2–3 (top) and y=15–19 (bottom) → output large Green/Maroon/Yellow modified in top (y=0–9) and bottom (y=9–19) rows.  
     - Train 2: Small blobs clustered at y=1–3, 5–10, 13, 17–18 → output Red/Blue/Maroon/Light Blue modified or added in matching row clusters (y=0–2, 3–8, 9–14, 15–19).  
     - Train 3: Small blobs at y=1–3 (top), 6–10, 13, 18 (bottom) → output Maroon/Orange/Yellow modified in top (y=0–9) and bottom (y=10–19) rows.  
   - No exceptions; y-alignment is exact or adjacent across all examples.

2. **Small left-side blobs color → introduced or changed color in output small/medium blobs (pixels 1–12) within affected rows**  
   - Consistent effect: Colors from small input blobs appear or dominate in new/expanded small or medium output blobs in the rows they trigger (from interaction 1). This suggests color "propagation" from left small blobs to output details.  
     - Train 1: Input small Dark Red/Yellow → output small Dark Red (many p=1) and Yellow (p=1) in triggered rows.  
     - Train 2: Input small Red/Blue/Yellow → output small Red (p=6–12) and Blue (p=1–2) in triggered rows (Yellow propagation unknown, as it does not appear directly).  
     - Train 3: Input small Green/Maroon/Red/Yellow/Dark Red → output small Green (p=1–3) and Maroon-integrated elements in triggered rows (Red/Dark Red propagation unknown, as they do not appear directly).  
   - Pixels in these output blobs are typically 1–12, matching input small scale; consistent color influence, though some inputs (e.g., Yellow in train 2) have unknown direct mapping.

3. **Small left-side blobs pixel count and holes (always 0) → modification of holes in large right-side components**  
   - Consistent effect: Presence and density (pixel count) of small blobs in a row trigger hole creation, reduction, or alteration in large components' affected rows (from interaction 1). Input small blobs have holes=0, but correlate with output hole changes.  
     - Train 1: 3 small blobs (total p=4, clustered top/bottom) → large Green holes=1→0, new Yellow holes=17 in affected rows.  
     - Train 2: 10 small blobs (total p=11, spread across rows) → all large Maroon/Light Blue remain holes=0, but new medium Red/Blue have holes=0 (no new holes created).  
     - Train 3: 5 small blobs (total p=20, top/bottom) → new large Maroon holes=1 in top affected rows (original large Orange/Yellow holes=0 preserved).  
   - Effect is consistent (holes only change in triggered rows), but exact rule (e.g., pixel density threshold for hole creation) is unknown.

4. **Large right-side components original color and pixel count → preservation or partial transfer to output large components (pixels ≥16)**  
   - Consistent effect: Large input components' colors and approximate pixel counts are retained or split into output large components, but only in non-triggered rows (unaffected by small blobs) or as bases for modification. Small blobs do not fully override but adjust these.  
     - Train 1: Input large Green (p=183, holes=1), Maroon (p=226, holes=1), Orange (p=46) → output large Green (p=130, holes=0), Maroon (p=94+29=123, holes=0), Orange (p=46 preserved exactly).  
     - Train 2: Input large Maroon (p=100×3+80=380 total), Light Blue (p=100×2=200) → output large Maroon (p=100+80+12+19+18=229 partial), Light Blue (p=100+55+6+3=164 partial).  
     - Train 3: Input large Orange (p=120×2=240), Yellow (p=120×2=240) → output large Orange (p=75+6+120=201 partial), Yellow (p=78+120=198 partial).  
   - Pixel counts are not exactly preserved (often reduced by 20–50%), but colors and scale are; interaction with small blobs (from 1–2) causes the reduction/splitting in affected rows (exact loss mechanism unknown).

### Notes on Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Unknown transformations**: Exact mechanics for pixel count reduction in large components (e.g., why train 1 Orange p=46 is preserved exactly while others decrease) cannot be explained from the data; it may involve bbox overlap or edges, but no consistent pattern emerges. Color mappings for some small blobs (e.g., Yellow → no direct output in train 2) are inconsistent or unknown.
- **No interaction or inconsistent**: The Pink component (holes=1, left bbox [0,0,5/7,19/29], p=42–68) appears in all inputs but never in outputs and shows no effect on other components (e.g., no row/color/hole changes tied to its position). It is isolated/static and excluded. Blue in train 1 input (p=16–17, not "small") has no consistent effect across examples. Position x-changes (left-to-right shifts) occur but are not tied to a specific property consistently. Shapes/silhouettes (e.g., edges from bbox width/height) show no obvious consistent interaction with movement or color.
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Single-pixel accents without y-alignment to large changes (none observed consistently). Elements not present in all examples (e.g., Light Blue only in train 2) are not included. No semantic meanings (e.g., "squiggles") can be identified from bbox/pixels alone.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 01:01:30] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where small "blobs" or non-zero patterns in the leftmost columns (0-5) of an input grid influence modifications to a base canvas extracted from the right side (columns 6+), such as color propagation, hole filling, and patterned interleaving or replacement in affected rows, ultimately producing a stylized or rule-based output grid of the same dimensions. The goal is to infer and apply consistent rules from training examples to correctly transform unseen test inputs, focusing on preserving large components while adapting small ones based on left-side cues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Affected rows are those with non-zero values in columns 0-4 (or possibly 0-5), indicating "small blobs" that trigger changes only in those rows, while unaffected rows remain mostly as in the base canvas.
 * Base canvas is typically the right 24 columns (starting from column 6), preserving large connected components (e.g., long horizontal runs of the same number) unless modified by left-side influences.
 * Propagation of colors from left blobs: Small left patterns (e.g., 1-2 cells) often replicate or extend into the left edge of the canvas in affected rows, but not always as simple fills—may involve matching shapes or alternating with dominant canvas colors.
 * Hole filling in large components: Zeros (0s) in affected rows' large blobs should be filled with the row's dominant color, but only within connected large structures; over-filling entire rows or ignoring connectivity leads to mismatches.
 * Y-range transformations: Changes vary by row position or groups (e.g., interleaving patterns like every 3rd cell with a secondary color such as 4,7, or 8), but must respect specific sequences seen in expectations (e.g., repeating triplets like 4-4-7 or 3-8-3); simple modulo-3 interleaving often distorts lengths or positions.
 * Subtle elements: Left blobs can indicate specific patterns (e.g., a single non-zero might trigger minimal changes, while pairs like 6-6 suggest extensions); large canvas components (e.g., runs of 8s or 9s) should not be fully overwritten unless explicitly cued; zeros in expectations are rare and purposeful, not always filled; row groups (e.g., upper vs. lower halves) may have thematic colors (5s top, 4s bottom); connectivity matters—treat horizontal runs as objects, but vertical alignment across rows can influence propagation.
 * Easy-to-miss: Dominant color calculation should consider only non-zero cells in the canvas row, not including left blobs initially; secondary colors for interleaving should be chosen from present canvas colors (prioritizing 4>7>8), not hardcoded; transformations must maintain exact 24-column width without truncation or padding errors; some rows in expectations show asymmetric patterns (e.g., longer runs on one side), suggesting non-uniform application.
 * All considerations: Avoid global changes—modifications are row-specific and only for affected rows; test for blob sizes (small: 1-3 cells, medium: 4-6, large: 7+ in row); potential for shape mirroring (e.g., left blob [1,1] mirrors to canvas edge); handle cases where left has no blobs (copy base unchanged); zeros might represent transparency or errors to preserve in some contexts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt structured the program modularly with functions for base extraction, affected row detection, color propagation, hole filling, and y-range transformations, which is helpful for debugging but overall incorrect as all training examples failed.
 * What worked: Correctly identified affected rows based on left non-zeros (e.g., in training 1, rows with 7s or 5s on left were targeted); base canvas extraction preserved right-side structure initially; dominant color calculation for filling was conceptually sound but over-applied (e.g., filled entire rows instead of holes only).
 * What didn't work: Propagation was too simplistic (replicated first left color to first 3 canvas positions, but expectations show more nuanced extensions like matching blob size or interleaving with canvas colors, e.g., training 1 row 1 expected all 5s extended but generated mixed 7-3); hole filling ignored connectivity, filling all 0s row-wide (e.g., training 1 row 3 generated 8s where expected has specific 4-7-8 patterns); y-range transformations used flawed modulo-3 interleaving that skipped indices incorrectly, leading to length mismatches and wrong secondary colors (e.g., forced 4/7/8 without checking presence, distorting patterns like expected 3-4-4-7 in training 1); no blob size classification, treating all left non-zeros uniformly.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated heavy 7-3 repetition in upper rows (e.g., row 1: [7,7,3,7,7,...] vs expected [5,5,5,5,3,...] with 5-extension); lower rows filled 8s/1s incorrectly (e.g., row 9: extra 1s at end vs expected mixed 4-7-8 without trailing 1); interleaving created uneven triplets, e.g., row 3 generated [7,7,3,7,7,7,...] but expected [5,5,5,3,3,3,3,...] with no 7s.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Upper rows incorrectly propagated 1/2 to canvas left without pattern matching (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,8,8,9,...] vs expected [2,2,1,8,8,9,...] showing left blob [2,2,1?] influencing specific positions); repeated 4s/8s/9s in middle but ignored expected 1-2-1 triplets (e.g., row 2 generated uniform 8-9 but expected [1,2,1,8,8,9,...]); lower rows over-filled 6s into 9-patterns without alternation.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Top rows incorrectly introduced 3s/8s where expected solid 5s or minimal changes (e.g., row 1: [8,8,5,3,3,...] vs expected [5,5,5,5,5,...] with 3-8 only in specific right positions); bottom 4-rows filled 6s uniformly but expected preserved 4s with inserted 3-8 patterns (e.g., row 6: [4,4,4,2,2,...] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,...3,8,8,...]); no handling for unaffected rows staying solid (e.g., rows 11-14 expected all 5s but generated mixed).
 * Function `propagate_small_colors` is broken (over-replicates to fixed 3 positions, ignores blob shape/size—don't use as-is). 
 * Function `modify_holes_in_large` is partially helpful but overzealous (fills all 0s, not just holes in large blobs—refine with connectivity check). 
 * Function `apply_y_range_transformations` is unhelpful (modulo-3 logic distorts lengths and chooses wrong secondaries—replace with pattern matching from expectations). 
 * Function `identify_affected_rows` and `extract_base_canvas` are correct and essential (keep and build on them). 
 * No object extraction function was used effectively; adding blob extraction (as in helpful tools above) is needed for better propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it relies on the same flawed program that failed all training examples, producing repetitive patterns (e.g., heavy 8-9-6/1/4/7 blocks with sudden 0s in rows 13-16) that don't align with expected subtlety from training (e.g., no nuanced interleaving like 3-8-3 or 4-7-4, instead uniform fills).
 * Upper rows show over-propagation of 6/1 into 8/9/4 backgrounds (e.g., row 0: [8,8,9,6,6,...] likely from left blob influence, but too uniform vs. training's varied extensions); middle rows introduce unexplained 0s (e.g., row 13: [7,7,0,7,7,...] suggesting failed hole filling, but expectations rarely have 0s—should be filled with dominant 7 or 9).
 * Lower rows repeat upper patterns without variation (e.g., rows 17-20 mirror rows 0-3 with 8-9-6, but training shows row-specific y-range differences like upper 5s vs. lower 4s—test lacks this stratification).
 * Overall, test output lacks the patterned insertions (e.g., triplets or alternations) seen in training expectations, instead showing blocky repetitions that ignore blob sizes; it makes sense as an extension of the program's errors but is incorrect because it doesn't mentally match inferred rules (e.g., for test's apparent left 9-6/1 patterns, expect something like 9-extended with 6-6 inserted into 8/4 runs, not full left fills).

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Colored pixelated shapes**: Includes squares, rectangles, circles, and irregular forms in hues like purple, yellow, blue, green, orange, magenta, black, and cyan, arranged in vertical stacks, nested structures (e.g., circles within circles or squares), and grid-like patterns.
- **Borders and outlines**: Solid or segmented edges in contrasting colors (e.g., black, orange, pink) enclosing or separating regions, often forming frames around central elements.
- **Central motifs**: Prominent features such as a purple circle with blue interior (input-style), a cross or plus sign in blue with colored extensions (output-style), and scattered dots or small blocks (e.g., yellow dots, green pixels) as accents.
- **Backgrounds and fills**: Uniform or gradient fills in green, blue, or transparent styles, with layered overlaps creating depth, generalized across simple (input) to complex (output) compositions.
- **Positional elements**: Vertical alignments on the left, horizontal spreads on the right, and symmetric or asymmetric distributions of pixels, applicable to both input (stacked figures) and output (transformed grids).

[2025-10-03 01:03:55] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data across all 3 training input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically in **every** training example (no assumptions from test inputs, as they lack outputs). I focused only on elements with direct, repeatable links (e.g., one property affecting another's position, color, or structure), ignoring isolated or varying elements (e.g., specific small Yellow placements vary by y-coordinate and do not consistently affect outputs). Irrelevant elements (e.g., scattered single-pixel accents without cross-example ties) are excluded. No high-level puzzle-solving is attempted; unknown transformations are noted explicitly.

- **Pink component (holes=1, left border position bbox starting at x=0, full height, pixels ≈42-68) → removal in output**: In every input, a single Pink component acts as a left-side enclosing border (bbox [0,0,5-ish,full height], holes=1). It is consistently absent in all outputs, with no corresponding Pink pixels, color, or structure. This suggests a positional interaction where the border frames/encloses other components but does not transform or carry over (effect: discarded entirely). No holes or pixels from Pink appear in any output component.

- **Small Dark Red bottom bar (holes=0, position y≈18-19, x≈2, horizontal bbox width=1-2, pixels=2) → unknown transformation (no consistent output counterpart)**: Every input has this exact small Dark Red component as a 2-pixel horizontal bar near the bottom-left (bbox [2,17-18,2-3,18-19]). It does not consistently map to a similar bar, color, or position in outputs (e.g., train1 outputs many scattered Dark Red 1-pixel items, but no matching bottom bar; train2/3 similar variance). Possible interaction with overall bottom positioning of large components, but transformation is unknown—no clear effect on color, holes, or bbox in outputs.

- **Large right-side components (colors: Green/Orange/Maroon/Light Blue/Yellow/Blue, position x≥6, vertical/full-height bbox, variable holes=0-1, pixels ≥46) → leftward positional shift and partial area preservation in output**: In every input, multiple large components occupy the right side (x≥6 to 29, often stacked or nested vertically/full height). Outputs consistently relocate same-color large components to the left side (x=0 to ≈23, same approximate height ranges), with some preserving exact pixel counts (e.g., Orange pixels=46 in train1 input/output; lower Orange/Yellow pixels=120 in train3 input/output). Interaction: input right position (x≥6) effects output left position (x≈0-4 start); no consistent hole change (input holes=0-1 → output holes=0-1 variably). Nested/overlapping input bboxes (e.g., Maroon inside Green in train1) lead to split/resized output versions of the same color, but exact split mechanism unknown.

- **Holes=1 in large input components (Green/Maroon/Pink, enclosed regions via bbox overlaps) → hole reduction or redistribution in output (holes=0 dominant for same colors)**: Every input features at least one large component with holes=1 (often nested/enclosed by others, e.g., Maroon inside Green). Outputs consistently show same colors with holes=0 for large versions (e.g., train1 Green/Maroon input holes=1 → output holes=0; train3 Maroon input holes=0 but gains holes=1 in one large output—wait, inconsistent for creation, but reduction from 1→0 holds in train1/2). Interaction: input hole count (1) and enclosure (via bbox overlap) effects output hole count (→0 for preserved large areas), possibly "filling" holes during transformation. High hole counts (e.g., output Yellow holes=17 in train1) are not tied to input holes consistently—unknown origin.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., small non-Dark Red components like Yellow/Red/Blue singles vary in position/color count and do not reliably affect specific output properties across all examples; no clear color→color mappings beyond large components; no consistent edge/silhouette effects on movement). Test inputs show similar structures (e.g., Pink borders, bottom Dark Red-ish bars, right large components) but cannot confirm interactions without outputs.

[2025-10-03 01:03:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data across all 3 training input/output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically in **every** training example (no assumptions from test inputs, as they lack outputs). I focused only on elements with direct, repeatable links (e.g., one property affecting another's position, color, or structure), ignoring isolated or varying elements (e.g., specific small Yellow placements vary by y-coordinate and do not consistently affect outputs). Irrelevant elements (e.g., scattered single-pixel accents without cross-example ties) are excluded. No high-level puzzle-solving is attempted; unknown transformations are noted explicitly.

- **Pink component (holes=1, left border position bbox starting at x=0, full height, pixels ≈42-68) → removal in output**: In every input, a single Pink component acts as a left-side enclosing border (bbox [0,0,5-ish,full height], holes=1). It is consistently absent in all outputs, with no corresponding Pink pixels, color, or structure. This suggests a positional interaction where the border frames/encloses other components but does not transform or carry over (effect: discarded entirely). No holes or pixels from Pink appear in any output component.

- **Small Dark Red bottom bar (holes=0, position y≈18-19, x≈2, horizontal bbox width=1-2, pixels=2) → unknown transformation (no consistent output counterpart)**: Every input has this exact small Dark Red component as a 2-pixel horizontal bar near the bottom-left (bbox [2,17-18,2-3,18-19]). It does not consistently map to a similar bar, color, or position in outputs (e.g., train1 outputs many scattered Dark Red 1-pixel items, but no matching bottom bar; train2/3 similar variance). Possible interaction with overall bottom positioning of large components, but transformation is unknown—no clear effect on color, holes, or bbox in outputs.

- **Large right-side components (colors: Green/Orange/Maroon/Light Blue/Yellow/Blue, position x≥6, vertical/full-height bbox, variable holes=0-1, pixels ≥46) → leftward positional shift and partial area preservation in output**: In every input, multiple large components occupy the right side (x≥6 to 29, often stacked or nested vertically/full height). Outputs consistently relocate same-color large components to the left side (x=0 to ≈23, same approximate height ranges), with some preserving exact pixel counts (e.g., Orange pixels=46 in train1 input/output; lower Orange/Yellow pixels=120 in train3 input/output). Interaction: input right position (x≥6) effects output left position (x≈0-4 start); no consistent hole change (input holes=0-1 → output holes=0-1 variably). Nested/overlapping input bboxes (e.g., Maroon inside Green in train1) lead to split/resized output versions of the same color, but exact split mechanism unknown.

- **Holes=1 in large input components (Green/Maroon/Pink, enclosed regions via bbox overlaps) → hole reduction or redistribution in output (holes=0 dominant for same colors)**: Every input features at least one large component with holes=1 (often nested/enclosed by others, e.g., Maroon inside Green). Outputs consistently show same colors with holes=0 for large versions (e.g., train1 Green/Maroon input holes=1 → output holes=0; train3 Maroon input holes=0 but gains holes=1 in one large output—wait, inconsistent for creation, but reduction from 1→0 holds in train1/2). Interaction: input hole count (1) and enclosure (via bbox overlap) effects output hole count (→0 for preserved large areas), possibly "filling" holes during transformation. High hole counts (e.g., output Yellow holes=17 in train1) are not tied to input holes consistently—unknown origin.

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., small non-Dark Red components like Yellow/Red/Blue singles vary in position/color count and do not reliably affect specific output properties across all examples; no clear color→color mappings beyond large components; no consistent edge/silhouette effects on movement). Test inputs show similar structures (e.g., Pink borders, bottom Dark Red-ish bars, right large components) but cannot confirm interactions without outputs.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 01:21:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images composed of numerical values (likely representing colors, pixels, or pattern elements), where the goal is to transform or extract specific patterns, shapes, or objects from the input grid to produce a modified output grid that matches complex expected arrangements, possibly simulating rendering, cropping, or object manipulation in a stylized or symbolic way (e.g., letters, icons, or layered designs).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are 20x24 (rows x columns), with numbers like 0-9 representing distinct visual elements (e.g., 5 might be background/white, 3/4/8 patterns for shapes, 1/2 for accents or holes); patterns form asymmetric shapes that suggest letters (e.g., train1 expected looks like a stylized "A" or "H" with internal divisions using 4/7/8).
 * Subtle elements include irregular boundaries, internal fills, and overlays (e.g., train1 has nested 4/7/8 within 3/5 borders; train2 has repeating 1/2 motifs in a 8/9 field like a patterned border; train3 has sparse 3/8 intrusions into uniform 5/4 blocks, possibly like dotted lines or accents).
 * Outputs preserve grid dimensions but alter values selectively— not simple uniform fills or crops; must handle asymmetry (e.g., diagonal shifts in train1 row 2-3) and repetitions (e.g., train2's periodic 1/2/8/9 cycles every few rows).
 * Easy to miss: Non-contiguous regions (e.g., isolated 1s in train1 row11-12), vertical/horizontal mirroring or staggering (e.g., train2's 1/2 placements alternate), and background preservation (e.g., train3 keeps large 5/4 areas but inserts 3/8 precisely).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction yet, but patterns imply identifying blobs/regions (e.g., connected components of same number); cropping ignores left-side context which may contain keys or mirrors (e.g., train1 generated misses left 5/3 buildup); uniform outputs (like train3 generated) fail to capture sparse changes; test input has dense 9/0 with sparse 2/3/4/6/7, suggesting need for pattern recognition beyond slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Basic grid utility (potentially helpful for future, but not used effectively here)
def get_grid_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    """Returns (rows, cols) of the grid."""
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else (0, 0)
```

```python
# Potential for object extraction (not implemented in attempt, but essential based on patterns; could identify connected regions)
def find_connected_regions(g: List[List[int]], start_val: int, directions: List[tuple] = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]) -> List[List[tuple[int,int]]]:
    """Extracts connected components (blobs) of a given value; returns list of region coordinates. Unimplemented in attempt but key for shape detection."""
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in g]
    regions = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] == start_val and not visited[i][j]:
                region = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if 0 <= x < len(g) and 0 <= y < len(g[0]) and g[x][y] == start_val and not visited[x][y]:
                        visited[x][y] = True
                        region.append((x, y))
                        for dx, dy in directions:
                            stack.append((x + dx, y + dy))
                regions.append(region)
    return regions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt used simple cropping (remove left 6 columns) assuming main content is right-shifted, but this failed all training examples by producing sliced inputs without transformation (e.g., retained raw patterns like 5/3/8/1 in train1 but ignored expected 4/7 insertions).
 * What worked: Preserved relative row lengths and some right-side details (e.g., train1 generated correctly shows 8-heavy lower sections), but this is coincidental and not rule-based.
 * What didn't work: Completely mismatched expected outputs—train1 generated has uniform 3/8 bands without 4/7 accents (e.g., row3 generated [5,5,5,3,...] vs expected [5,5,5,3,...,4,4,4,...] with internal 4s); train2 generated uniform 8/9 stripes ignoring 1/2 motifs (e.g., all rows identical 8/9 blocks vs expected alternating 1/2 insertions every 3 rows); train3 generated solid 5/4 blocks missing sparse 3/8 (e.g., row1 all 5s vs expected mixed 5/8 at end); no understanding of pattern rules, just mechanical slice.
 * Cropping function `crop_right_part` is broken/not helpful (arbitrary 6-column cut; left side likely contains setup/context, e.g., train1 input implied to have more left structure); don't use in future without validation.
 * No object extraction attempted, but needed—patterns suggest manipulating detected shapes (e.g., filling holes with 1s in train1, or overlaying 3/8 in train3).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes (e.g., expected has irregular 4/7/8 clusters, generated keeps input 8/1 without change; unknown why, possibly no region detection).
 * Train2 omits periodic accents (1/2 as "dots" in 8/9 field; generated uniform, missing cycle).
 * Train3 ignores intrusions (3/8 as sparse overlays; generated solid, no subtlety in placement).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a naive crop (removing ~left 6-8 columns variably, retaining raw 9/0/6 with minor 2/3/4/7), producing repetitive 9/0 bands and isolated changes (e.g., row2-3 has 2/4 swaps, row10 has 3s) without transformation, which mismatches puzzle's need for pattern synthesis (e.g., expected likely reorganizes sparse elements like 2/3/4/6/7 into structured motifs within 9/0/6 background, similar to train3's 3/8 dots; current output looks like unprocessed input slice, missing any shape detection or overlay rules).
 * Test has vertical repetitions (e.g., rows 0-5 identical 9/0/6), horizontal sparsity (e.g., 2/4 only in cols 22-23 rows 2-3), and bottom variations (e.g., row23 has 4/6), suggesting rules for propagating or mirroring these (e.g., fill regions or alternate like train2), but generated ignores this for raw dump.
 * To handle test, account for background dominance (9/0 as fill) and accent propagation (e.g., extend 6s or insert based on neighbors); current output fails as it doesn't demonstrate puzzle understanding.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 01:22:13] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (no exceptions). I focused solely on properties like color, position (bbox), holes, and pixel count that demonstrably affect or connect to other elements in a repeatable way across all cases. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone small components without clear ties to larger structures) are excluded. Transformations that cannot be explained consistently (e.g., exact pixel count changes or non-obvious color shifts like Yellow → Blue in train 2 only) are noted as unknown rather than speculated. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is implied or attempted.

1. **Pink (left border) position → large right components' position transformation**  
   - The Pink component (color=Pink, holes=1, bbox x-start=0, width ~5-6 units, y-span full height ~0-19, pixels ~42) is consistently present in all inputs as a left-edge enclosure.  
   - It interacts with large block components (pixels >100, various colors like Green/Maroon/Orange/Yellow/Light Blue, bbox x-start ≥6, full or near-full y-height) by enabling a leftward bbox x-shift (~ -6 units, matching Pink's width). This moves the large blocks into the Pink's space (x=0+).  
   - Consistent effect: Pink disappears entirely in all outputs; large blocks preserve color and approximate y-bbox but adjust x-bbox leftward (e.g., x-start 6→0, x-end shortens proportionally). Pixel count may decrease (unknown cause, e.g., due to unmodeled overlap).  
   - No effect on small components (<20 pixels).

2. **Large right components' holes → loss/reduction in output**  
   - Large blocks (as above, x-start ≥6, pixels >100) with holes=1 in inputs (e.g., Green or Maroon) consistently interact with the shift (tied to Pink position).  
   - Effect: Holes reduce to 0 in outputs for these components (or their split parts). Pixel count and color preserved, but structure simplifies (no new holes created from these). Consistent in cases where input holes=1 (trains 1 and 3); no holes in input train 2 yields no holes in output.

3. **Small left components (position/color) → repositioning to right in output**  
   - Small components (pixels 1-17, colors like Yellow/Dark Red/Green/Red/Blue, bbox x<6, scattered y-positions) in inputs consistently interact via position (left x<6) and color.  
   - Effect: They are relocated to right-side positions (output bbox x ≥15-20, often near x-end ~23) while preserving approximate y-bbox clusters. Color usually preserved (e.g., Green → Green in train 3, Dark Red → Dark Red in train 1), but occasional unknown changes occur (e.g., some Yellow disappear or shift to Blue in train 2). Number of small components increases (replication/splitting, e.g., 1-3 input → 5+ output), pixel count per component stays low (~1-6). No interaction with large blocks' shift.

4. **Small left components' pixel count → grouping in output**  
   - Small components (as above, left x<6, low pixels) consistently interact based on input pixel count (1-17).  
   - Effect: Low-pixel singles (1-2 pixels) group or replicate into multiple similar small components in output right-side positions (total pixels increase slightly, e.g., input total ~10-20 → output ~20-50 across group). Higher input small pixels (6-17) may split into 2-3 output smalls of similar color/position. Unknown if this affects holes (none in these smalls consistently).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-color mappings beyond preservation; no consistent hole creation from smalls; y-position mappings vary too much to explain; test inputs show variations like dual Pink or taller height, but analysis is train-only). Elements like nested shapes or symmetrical patterns in the descriptions do not show clear, consistent ties to transformations across all trains.

[2025-10-03 01:25:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images composed of numerical values (likely representing colors, pixels, or pattern elements), where the goal is to transform or extract specific patterns, shapes, or objects from the input grid to produce a modified output grid that matches complex expected arrangements, possibly simulating rendering, cropping, or object manipulation in a stylized or symbolic way (e.g., letters, icons, or layered designs).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are 20x24 (rows x columns), with numbers like 0-9 representing distinct visual elements (e.g., 5 might be background/white, 3/4/8 patterns for shapes, 1/2 for accents or holes); patterns form asymmetric shapes that suggest letters (e.g., train1 expected looks like a stylized "A" or "H" with internal divisions using 4/7/8).
 * Subtle elements include irregular boundaries, internal fills, and overlays (e.g., train1 has nested 4/7/8 within 3/5 borders; train2 has repeating 1/2 motifs in a 8/9 field like a patterned border; train3 has sparse 3/8 intrusions into uniform 5/4 blocks, possibly like dotted lines or accents).
 * Outputs preserve grid dimensions but alter values selectively— not simple uniform fills or crops; must handle asymmetry (e.g., diagonal shifts in train1 row 2-3) and repetitions (e.g., train2's periodic 1/2/8/9 cycles every few rows).
 * Easy to miss: Non-contiguous regions (e.g., isolated 1s in train1 row11-12), vertical/horizontal mirroring or staggering (e.g., train2's 1/2 placements alternate), and background preservation (e.g., train3 keeps large 5/4 areas but inserts 3/8 precisely).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction yet, but patterns imply identifying blobs/regions (e.g., connected components of same number); cropping ignores left-side context which may contain keys or mirrors (e.g., train1 generated misses left 5/3 buildup); uniform outputs (like train3 generated) fail to capture sparse changes; test input has dense 9/0 with sparse 2/3/4/6/7, suggesting need for pattern recognition beyond slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Basic grid utility (potentially helpful for future, but not used effectively here)
def get_grid_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    """Returns (rows, cols) of the grid."""
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else (0, 0)
```

```python
# Potential for object extraction (not implemented in attempt, but essential based on patterns; could identify connected regions)
def find_connected_regions(g: List[List[int]], start_val: int, directions: List[tuple] = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]) -> List[List[tuple[int,int]]]:
    """Extracts connected components (blobs) of a given value; returns list of region coordinates. Unimplemented in attempt but key for shape detection."""
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in g]
    regions = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] == start_val and not visited[i][j]:
                region = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if 0 <= x < len(g) and 0 <= y < len(g[0]) and g[x][y] == start_val and not visited[x][y]:
                        visited[x][y] = True
                        region.append((x, y))
                        for dx, dy in directions:
                            stack.append((x + dx, y + dy))
                regions.append(region)
    return regions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt used simple cropping (remove left 6 columns) assuming main content is right-shifted, but this failed all training examples by producing sliced inputs without transformation (e.g., retained raw patterns like 5/3/8/1 in train1 but ignored expected 4/7 insertions).
 * What worked: Preserved relative row lengths and some right-side details (e.g., train1 generated correctly shows 8-heavy lower sections), but this is coincidental and not rule-based.
 * What didn't work: Completely mismatched expected outputs—train1 generated has uniform 3/8 bands without 4/7 accents (e.g., row3 generated [5,5,5,3,...] vs expected [5,5,5,3,...,4,4,4,...] with internal 4s); train2 generated uniform 8/9 stripes ignoring 1/2 motifs (e.g., all rows identical 8/9 blocks vs expected alternating 1/2 insertions every 3 rows); train3 generated solid 5/4 blocks missing sparse 3/8 (e.g., row1 all 5s vs expected mixed 5/8 at end); no understanding of pattern rules, just mechanical slice.
 * Cropping function `crop_right_part` is broken/not helpful (arbitrary 6-column cut; left side likely contains setup/context, e.g., train1 input implied to have more left structure); don't use in future without validation.
 * No object extraction attempted, but needed—patterns suggest manipulating detected shapes (e.g., filling holes with 1s in train1, or overlaying 3/8 in train3).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes (e.g., expected has irregular 4/7/8 clusters, generated keeps input 8/1 without change; unknown why, possibly no region detection).
 * Train2 omits periodic accents (1/2 as "dots" in 8/9 field; generated uniform, missing cycle).
 * Train3 ignores intrusions (3/8 as sparse overlays; generated solid, no subtlety in placement).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a naive crop (removing ~left 6-8 columns variably, retaining raw 9/0/6 with minor 2/3/4/7), producing repetitive 9/0 bands and isolated changes (e.g., row2-3 has 2/4 swaps, row10 has 3s) without transformation, which mismatches puzzle's need for pattern synthesis (e.g., expected likely reorganizes sparse elements like 2/3/4/6/7 into structured motifs within 9/0/6 background, similar to train3's 3/8 dots; current output looks like unprocessed input slice, missing any shape detection or overlay rules).
 * Test has vertical repetitions (e.g., rows 0-5 identical 9/0/6), horizontal sparsity (e.g., 2/4 only in cols 22-23 rows 2-3), and bottom variations (e.g., row23 has 4/6), suggesting rules for propagating or mirroring these (e.g., fill regions or alternate like train2), but generated ignores this for raw dump.
 * To handle test, account for background dominance (9/0 as fill) and accent propagation (e.g., extend 6s or insert based on neighbors); current output fails as it doesn't demonstrate puzzle understanding.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors, patterns, or elements in a bordered frame, and the task is to process the input grid to output a cleaned or transformed version of the interior puzzle content, preserving the overall structure but correctly interpreting or extracting the main visual elements while removing framing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * All inputs appear to have a consistent left border (first 6 columns) consisting of frame elements like 6's or other consistent values that frame the puzzle, which must be cropped to access the 24-column interior; however, simply cropping without further processing leaves the interior numbers unchanged, which does not match expectations.
 * Interiors contain patterns of numbers (e.g., 3's, 8's, 4's, 7's, 1's, 9's, 0's) that likely represent shapes, objects, or encoded visuals; expected outputs show transformations or replacements in these areas (e.g., blocks of 8's become mixed 4's/7's in train 1, uniform 9's become patterned 1's/2's in train 2), suggesting rules for decoding, filling, or recognizing connected components/blobs rather than literal copying.
 * Top and bottom rows often retain border-like values (e.g., 5's in train 1 and 3), indicating that horizontal borders may be part of the output or need selective preservation, while vertical frames (left/right) are fully removed; right borders (e.g., 6's in test) may also need cropping or handling.
 * Subtle patterns include non-uniform interiors: train 1 has irregular shapes with 1's and 8's that become more complex with 4's/7's; train 2 has repeating horizontal bands that resolve into vertical motifs with 1's/2's interrupting 9's; train 3 has solid blocks (5's and 4's) that embed finer 3/8 patterns, implying hierarchical structure or overlay rules.
 * Grids are consistently 20 rows by 24 columns post-crop, but inputs are likely 30 columns wide; no rotation, scaling, or dimension changes are needed, but connected regions (e.g., blobs of same numbers) may need extraction or replacement based on size, shape, or position.
 * Easy-to-miss: Uniform generated outputs (e.g., all 8's/9's in bands) ignore subtle interruptions or encodings in the original (e.g., 1's/2's as separators or holes); right-side elements like 6's in test may be frame remnants needing removal; 0's in test could be empty space or background, but without transformation, they persist incorrectly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, focused solely on left cropping; future attempts must address interior decoding (e.g., pattern recognition for shapes like letters/symbols); handle variable border thicknesses if present; ensure output matches exact expected values, not just dimensions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def crop_left_border(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Crops the left 6 columns (frame) from each row, assuming 30-column input, to yield 24-column interior.
    This is a necessary first step as it correctly removes the consistent left frame in all examples,
    but must be combined with interior processing for full correctness.
    """
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```

No other functions from the attempt; no extraction tools for blobs/objects were provided, but they would be essential for identifying and transforming patterns (e.g., connected components of numbers like 8's into decoded shapes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and removes the left border (6 columns of frame), which aligns with the positioning of main content in all training examples and produces the right dimensions (24 columns), but fails entirely on interior content by copying values verbatim without transformation.
 * Train 1: Generated a simple diagonal/rectangular shape of 3's filled with 8's and isolated 1's, but expected a more intricate pattern with 4's/7's replacing many 8's, 1's repositioned or expanded, and additional 4's/7's in non-8 areas (e.g., row 2 expected has 4's/3's mix where generated has all 3's; unknown why 8's map to 4/7 but likely shape decoding).
 * Train 2: Generated uniform horizontal bands of 8's interrupted only by 9's, but expected inserts 1's/2's in specific positions (e.g., row 0 expected starts [2,2,1,...] where generated has all 8's/9's; this misses patterned motifs like checkerboard or symbols in the 8/9 areas).
 * Train 3: Generated solid horizontal blocks of 5's (top/bottom) and 4's (middle), but expected embeds 3/8 patterns within those blocks (e.g., row 1 expected has 3/8 interruptions in 5's where generated is uniform 5's; row 6 expected mixes 3/8 in 4's area).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but naive cropping alone is insufficient and broken for the full problem (do not use without adding pattern recognition or mapping rules).
 * Extracting objects/blobs (not implemented) seems essential for future attempts to handle shape-based transformations, as generated outputs ignore connected regions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it merely crops the left 6 columns, resulting in a grid of 9's (likely background/frame), 0's (empty or interior space), 6's (right frame remnants), and scattered 2/3/4/7's, but based on training examples, this unchanged interior likely needs transformation (e.g., 9/0/6 patterns should decode into mixed numbers like 1/2/3/4/7/8 as in trains; scattered digits like 2/4 in row 2 may be part of shapes that get filled or replaced).
 * It preserves right-side 6's (e.g., column 19 in many rows), which may be a right border needing cropping (e.g., to 24 columns total, but test shows 24 values with 6's at end, suggesting incomplete frame removal); uniform 9's and 0's bands resemble train 2/3 generated failures, missing subtle embeddings (e.g., row 10 has 3's that might expand into patterns).
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exactly, but it does not make sense as a final puzzle solution since training shows interiors must be actively processed, not copied; account for potential right-cropping (e.g., remove last 0-6 columns if 6's are frame) and blob detection to handle isolated 0/3/7 as object starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of input grids (2D lists of integers representing colored pixels, likely 0=background, 1-9=colors) into output grids that follow specific spatial and structural rules derived from patterns in the examples. The transformations preserve certain elements like large colored blocks, small clusters, and holes while removing frames, redistributing pixels, and adjusting positions/sizes to fit a standard 20x24 canvas, often reducing complexity or pixel density.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Inputs appear to have a left-side "pink frame" (possibly color 6 or background with holes=1 property) spanning ~6 columns that must be removed by shifting the main content left, but without losing overlap or cluster details—subtlety: the frame might not always be uniform, and ignoring it can cause misalignment in subsequent steps.
 * Top-left small pixel clusters (1-5 pixels, colors like 3,4,5) need to be extracted, their colors inferred, and redistributed into sparse 1-3 pixel patterns across the top rows or canvas edges, approximating original pixel count but not exactly—easy to miss: redistribution should avoid overwriting large blocks and preserve color variety, not just cycle through one color.
 * Large colored blocks (e.g., solid regions of 4,5,8,9) must be repositioned leftward (slicing and expanding to fill ~x=0-23), split/combined if needed, and reduced in pixel count by 10-20% through overlaps or trimming, while maintaining color and hole properties (holes=0 or increased via filling)—subtlety: expansion shouldn't fill gaps with arbitrary colors (e.g., propagating previous color blindly); instead, resolve overlaps by priority (e.g., foreground over background) and ensure no uniform filling with a single color like 3.
 * Bottom small dark red elements (color 7, often 2-4 pixels in pairs) from input bottom rows should be placed/shifted rightward into the output's bottom 1-2 rows, typically 2-4 instances—key: count and position based on input occurrences, but avoid overplacing or ignoring row overlaps.
 * Shapes with holes (especially large ones with holes=1) need modification: map to outputs with holes=0 or more, propagate/fill using nearby cluster colors, and reduce pixel count by 20-50% via overwriting or trimming—subtlety: filling shouldn't use arbitrary colors (e.g., hard-coded 3); instead, use context from input (e.g., green=3 or 5), and avoid global overwrites that turn everything uniform.
 * Overall canvas is consistently 20 rows x 24 columns; background is often 3 (light green?) or 0, but outputs mix backgrounds strategically—easy to miss: preserve asymmetry and patterns (e.g., interspersed 1's,2's for holes or dividers); pixel reduction is approximate, not exact; rules interact (e.g., redistribution after frame removal, before block repositioning).
 * Common pitfalls: Over-filling with background color 3 (seen in all attempts, creating solid top rows); introducing 0's in test output (likely invalid, as expected outputs avoid raw 0's); ignoring hole propagation (e.g., 1's in expected as hole markers); not handling variable block sizes/splits (e.g., expected has dotted patterns like 4-7-4, not solid blocks).
 * Considerations across attempts: Rules must be applied sequentially but with input references preserved (e.g., don't modify g in place); count pixels/holes accurately (e.g., sum non-0/6 in regions); handle no-cluster cases gracefully; subtle color mappings (e.g., 7= dark red, 6=pink/frame, 8/9=large blocks, 4/5=medium shapes).

* Note: extract_large_blocks is a helpful skeleton but needs full flood-fill implementation for accuracy (current program lacks this, leading to blind slicing).
* count_bottom_elements is useful and partially correct in the original place_bottom_dark_red, but ignores rightward shift logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, producing grids with excessive uniform 3's in top 4 rows (generated solid [3]*24, expected has patterned 5's,3's,4's,2's,1's), indicating broken remove_pink_frame or initial out creation—likely assumes wrong width (out_w = w-6) without padding to 24 cols.
 * redistribute_top_left_cluster worked partially in extracting colors but failed in placement: cycles colors into fixed starts [0,6,12,18] creating repetitive 1-3 pixel groups, but overwrites large areas incorrectly (e.g., Train1 generated scattered 3's/5's/4's in top, expected has structured top-left 5's block); num_pix logic is arbitrary and doesn't approximate count.
 * reposition_large_blocks is broken: simulates expansion by propagating colors left-to-right (filling 0's with prev), but introduces uniform fills (e.g., Train1 has solid 3's propagating, expected has irregular 8's/4's with 7's holes); pixel loss via arbitrary 10% overwrite to neighbor is unhelpful and creates artifacts (e.g., Train2 solid 8/9 blocks without 1/2 dividers); doesn't actually split/combine or handle overlaps properly.
 * place_bottom_dark_red partially works: counts bottom 7's correctly but places too many (min(4,max(2,count))) in fixed right position (start_j=24-num_place), duplicating in two rows—Train1 placed [7,7] at end but expected has scattered 7's integrated into patterns; Train3 placed [7,7] but expected has no bottom 7's, showing over-placement when input lacks them.
 * modify_shape_holes is unhelpful/broken: hard-codes fill to 3 (green), overwrites ~20% non-zero globally without hole detection, leading to uniform reduction (e.g., Train1 overwrote to 3's everywhere, expected preserves detailed 1's/7's; Train2/3 similar uniform 4's/5's); ignores input holes=1 mapping, causing loss of structure (e.g., expected holes via 1's or gaps not filled arbitrarily).
 * Overall: Program assumes fixed 6-col frame removal without verification (works if present, but test has no clear frame); sequential application loses input context (e.g., g not passed consistently); no object extraction, so rules are blind operations—essential for handling variable inputs; Train1 mismatches blob shapes (e.g., expected complex 4-7-8 weave, generated solid 8's with wrong 1's); Train2 misses small 1/2 patterns (generated solid 8/9, expected dotted 2-1-2 dividers); Train3 ignores top 5's patterning (generated solid 5's row, expected interspersed 3/8 holes); subtle: all generated have trailing 3's on right, expected fills canvas fully without them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Top 6 rows are solid 3's (likely from unhandled empty space post-frame removal or bad init), while expected should start with patterned large blocks (e.g., similar to Train3's top 5's with 8's holes)—this uniform fill ignores any top clusters. Middle has solid 9's blocks (rows 6-12,18-31? but grid is 20x24, output shows 32 rows? likely formatting error, but assumes solid expansion without splits/holes). Rows 13-16 have 0's (raw background, invalid as expected avoids 0's, using 3 instead), breaking continuity. Bottom has 6's blocks with stray 4's and 7's (e.g., row 30 has 6,6,4,4,6,6; rows 31-32 have 7's), but placement seems arbitrary—not right-shifted bottom 7's, and 6's (pink?) shouldn't persist post-frame removal. Overall, lacks reduction (solid blocks > expected sparse), no hole filling (0's unfilled), and doesn't match expected style of integrated patterns (e.g., 9's with 6/7/4 interspersions); test input has vertical 9's tower left, horizontal 6's right/mid, bottom 0's and 7's—output should shift 9's left, redistribute any top clusters into top, fill 0's with 3 or clusters, place 2-4 7's bottom-right, reduce 9/6 density by 20%.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where the left portion of each row (likely columns 0-5) encodes a pattern or rule that must be extracted and applied as an overlay or transformation to the cropped main content area (likely columns 6-29, producing 24 elements per row). The goal is to generate a modified output grid that matches expected transformations, involving header normalizations, pattern cycling for empty rows, and periodic overlays, but the current approach misapplies these rules leading to mismatches in pattern propagation, header extensions, and overlay positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 columns, ignoring or framing with specific values like 0,6,7; leading frames determine repetition, and non-zero values after form the core pattern, but this fails when patterns shift or cycle incorrectly across consecutive empty rows.
 * Header normalization extends initial runs of 5's to exactly 3 cells and 3's to 6 cells by overwriting subsequent cells, but this is applied universally without checking row context, leading to over-extension or incorrect starts (e.g., turning partial 5's into full 3's prematurely).
 * Overlays apply a 3-element pattern (padded/repeated if short, with 1's mapped to 4's) starting at index 9 of the crop, repeating every 6 positions for the first 3 slots of each block, but this ignores varying block structures, deeper pattern rotations (e.g., [1:] + [0] for cycles), and doesn't handle cases where patterns evolve mid-grid or interact with existing content like 8's or 9's.
 * Consecutive empty patterns (no non-frame values in left) carry the previous pattern but cycle it (e.g., rotate left by 1), resetting counter on new patterns; however, the cycle logic only triggers after >1 empty, which misses single-empty carries and fails on long sequences.
 * Crop is always row[6:30] (24 elements), assuming fixed width; outputs must preserve this length without introducing 0's unless they are part of the expected transformation.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may need to be derived from cumulative or row-spanning logic (e.g., vertical alignment across rows), 1's specifically map to 4's in overlays but not elsewhere, and certain values like 8's or 9's act as backgrounds that overlays replace selectively; empty lefts don't always cycle but may default to all-5 or all-3 headers.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show progressive shifts (e.g., 5's shrinking, 3's expanding, overlays inserting 4/7/8 blocks), suggesting rules tied to row index or global progression, not just per-row left extraction.
 * Avoid universal normalization—some rows in expected have irregular headers (e.g., single 5's or mixed 3/8 without extension); overlays may start earlier/later or apply to different strides based on pattern length.
 * 0's in left indicate frames/empties but should not propagate to output crops unless expected; test inputs have 0's in crops, which generated outputs retain incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract pattern from left 5 columns based on leading frame colors (0,6,7)."""
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    leading = 0
    i = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []  # Empty pattern
    first = left[i]
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function partially works for identifying leading repeats but fails on complex lefts with mixed non-frames; useful as a starting point for extraction but needs refinement for cycling.)

```python
def normalize_header(crop: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extend initial runs of 5 and 3 to 3 and 6 respectively by overwriting next cells."""
    crop = crop[:]  # Copy
    # Extend 5's to 3
    num5 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 5
    # Re-find and extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(crop) and crop[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    num3 = 0
    i = start3
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 3
    return crop
```
(This is broken for rows without initial 5/3 runs, as it forces extensions where expected outputs have different starts like 8's or 4's; not helpful without conditional application based on left pattern.)

```python
def apply_overlay(crop: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Apply pattern overlay starting from position 9, every 6 positions, replacing first 3."""
    p = pattern[:]
    while len(p) < 3 and p:
        p.append(p[-1])
    p = p[:3]
    result = crop[:]
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Map 1's to 4's
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(3):
            if start + k < 24:
                result[start + k] = p[k]
    return result
```
(This overlays too rigidly at fixed starts/stride, ignoring expected variations like shifting to positions 0-8 or different repeats; unhelpful for dynamic patterns, e.g., rotating 7/8 blocks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the crop as row[6:30] and handles basic pattern extraction from left, with consecutive empty logic attempting carry-over, but fails overall as all training examples are incorrect.
 * For Training 1: Rows 0-1 match expected headers exactly ([5x5 + 3x22 +5x2] and [5x4 +3x20]), but row 2 mismatches from pos 9-11 (generated 4,4,4 vs expected 3,3,3) and pos 18-20 (3,3,3 vs 4,4,4), showing overlay wrongly inserts 4's where 3's should persist; row 4 mismatches pos 10 (7 vs nothing, expected has 4,7,4 but generated shifts); row 5 major mismatch (generated 4,7,4,8x3 vs expected 5,5,3x5,8x2 + all 4's), indicating failed header shrink and wrong overlay cycle; later rows like 8-12 insert 1's/4's incorrectly where expected has 8's/3's evolving vertically; row 17 has 6's where expected has 3's/8's, suggesting pattern misderivation from left.
 * For Training 2: Almost no matches—row 0 generated [5x3,3x6,9,8x5,9x4,8x4] vs expected [2x2,1,8x2,9,2x2,1,9,8x5,9x4,8x4], wrong headers and overlays (9/8 blocks overwritten incorrectly); row 1 has 4's/2's where expected has 2's/9's, showing 1->4 map applied wrongly and pattern [4,4,2] not matching expected [2,2,2]; repetitive 4/8/9 blocks in rows 5-12 ignore expected cycling of 1/2 patterns; row 13 introduces 6's mismatched to expected 2's, indicating broken cycling for empties.
 * For Training 3: Row 0 all 5's matches, but row 1 generated [5x9,3x3,5x3,3x3,5x3,3x3] vs expected [5x15,3,8,3x2,8,3x2,8,3], wrong extension of 3's and missing 8 insertions; row 2 has 8,3,8 repeats where expected has 3,8x2,3 etc., close but shifted; rows 5-9 mismatch overlays (e.g., row 5 generated 3x6 +8,4x3 etc. vs expected 4x15,3,8x2,4x3,3,8x2), failing to propagate 4's fully; rows 15-19 repetitive 4/6 but expected all 4's, showing over-application of patterns.
 * get_pattern is somewhat helpful for simple lefts but broken for frames with embedded non-zeros or when leading != repeat count.
 * normalize_header is not helpful—overwrites too aggressively, causing header mismatches in all examples where expected has non-extended or alternative starts (e.g., direct 8's in train3).
 * apply_overlay is incorrect—fixed range(9,24,6) misses early overlays (e.g., pos 0 in some expected) and doesn't rotate patterns per row, leading to static repeats; don't use without dynamic start/stride.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of cropping and left extraction but misses vertical/global pattern evolution, conditional normalization, and flexible overlays; consecutive_empty >1 for cycling is too strict, as some expected carries happen on first empty.
 * No functions for vertical alignment or cumulative patterns, which seems essential given row-to-row progressions in expected (e.g., shrinking 5's, expanding 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it retains many 0's from the input crop (e.g., row 0 pos 9-11=0,0,9... but ends with 6,0x4, introducing artifacts not in training expecteds, which avoid 0's in structured blocks), suggesting failed overwriting or pattern application leaves empties untouched.
 * Headers are mostly [5x3,3x6] which may be right for some rows, but overlays insert inconsistent 4/6/3/9 blocks (e.g., row 1: 4,4,6,9x3,4,4,6,9,6,0,4,4,6 with lingering 0's and mismatched 6's where patterns cycle wrongly); row 4 has 3,6,4 repeats but expected likely needs full 9/6 propagation without 0's.
 * Later rows like 13-17 have 0's in pos 12-14/18 (e.g., 3,6,4,0x3,3,6,4,0,6,0,3,6,4), which looks like incomplete overlays or failed normalization, not matching clean block structures in training expecteds (e.g., no 0's, full 3/4/8/9 fills).
 * Row 26 has [5x3,3x6,4x3,9x3,4x3,4,9,6,0,4x3] with 0's and partial 6's, indicating the cycling/overlay logic breaks on long sequences, producing messy outputs unlike expected uniform transformations.
 * Overall, test output makes no sense as a solved puzzle—too many 0's and irregularities suggest the program doesn't fully transform the crop, missing core rules like complete replacement or background filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors, shapes, or symbols in a larger image) where the left margin (first 5-6 columns) of each row encodes instructions or patterns that must be extracted, processed (e.g., rotated, mapped, normalized), and overlaid onto the main body of the grid (columns 6-30, cropped to 24 elements) to complete or transform the image according to repeating or propagating rules. The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, such as extending headers, filling sections with rotated motifs, or applying cyclic overlays, while handling special cases like empty patterns or frame elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 elements of each row; elements 0,6,7 seem to act as "frame" or ignore markers that skip leading positions, but only if they don't fill the entire left side—subtlety: if the entire left is frame, return empty and rotate the previous row's pattern.
 * Empty patterns (all frame or invalid) inherit and rotate the previous row's pattern leftward (cycle shift), but this rotation must preserve length and only apply when needed; easy to miss: rotation happens before mapping/padding, and original length tracks for header normalization.
 * Mapping rule: 1 specifically maps to 4, while other values pass through—subtlety: this is likely a color/symbol substitution, but only for certain extracted elements; don't apply globally.
 * Padding: Patterns shorter than 3 are padded by repeating the last element (or 0 if empty), then truncated to exactly 3—key: this ensures consistent overlay size, but over-padding can cause repetition errors in longer sections.
 * Normalization for headers: Rows with empty patterns (original_len==0) extend leading 5's to exactly 3 positions (overwriting if needed), then extend following 3's to exactly 6 positions—subtlety: this only applies to "header" rows without patterns; it doesn't touch other numbers, and extensions stop at row length (24 after crop).
 * Overlay application: Patterns (padded to 3) are stamped starting at positions 9,15,21 (0-indexed in the 24-element cropped row), overwriting existing values—easy to miss: this creates 3 repeating sections per row, but only if pos <24; it ignores the first 9 positions (likely a fixed left area) and assumes crop starts at original index 6.
 * Grid structure: Input g has rows of at least 30 elements; output is cropped to [6:30] (24 elems) per row, height preserved; patterns propagate vertically via previous_pattern, so row dependencies are crucial—subtlety: no horizontal propagation, but vertical inheritance can create staggered or rotating motifs across rows.
 * Special numbers: 5 often acts as a header/start marker (extends to 3), 3 as a filler/extender (to 6), 8/9 as backgrounds or walls; 4,6,7 as pattern elements; 0/1/2 as placeholders or holes—key: overlays can overwrite these, but extractions must avoid frame pollution.
 * Edge cases: Full-empty rows rotate prior; leading non-frame starts pattern immediately; if leading==0, pattern is just [first]; append non-zero from rest of left—subtlety: this skips 0's in extraction but includes them in patterns sometimes, leading to 0-padding issues.
 * Overall rules: Transform preserves structure but fills/completes sections based on left cues; mismatches often from incorrect extraction (e.g., including frame), wrong rotation timing, or overlay positions; consider vertical continuity and exact length enforcement to avoid spillover.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This extracts patterns by skipping leading frame elements and building from first non-frame, appending non-zeros; useful for left-margin parsing, but buggy on full-frame or mixed 0/non-0.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cycle shift for inheritance; helpful for propagating patterns vertically, but needs careful application only on empties.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads to fixed overlay size; useful, but repetition can amplify errors if pattern is wrong.)

```python
def normalize_header(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    row = row[:]
    # Extend 5's to 3
    i = 0
    num5 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 5
    # Extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(row) and row[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    i = start3
    num3 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 3
    return row
```
(Handles header extension for empty-pattern rows; partially useful for 5/3 rules, but limited to leading sequences and doesn't handle other fillers like 8/9.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(len(p)):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Stamps pattern in sections 9-11,15-17,21-23; core for filling, but assumes p len=3 and fixed starts—helpful if positions are correct.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of left-extraction and overlay but incorrect pattern building, rotation, and normalization.
 * Train 1: Generated short/incomplete 3-extensions (e.g., first row has only four 3's then 0's, but expected 20+ 3's across sections with trailing 5's); mismatched overlays like row 5 having scattered 7/8 instead of uniform 4's, row 8 having 1's in wrong spots vs expected 4's/8's; row 9 has 1's and 4's but expected mixed 8/4/7 with 3-end; unknown why 1's appear (from unmapped extraction?) and rotations don't align vertical motifs.
 * Train 2: Generated repetitive 4's/2's/6's in overlays but ignores left patterns like 2/1/8/9; first row starts with 5/3 but expected 2/1/8/9 blocks; many rows have uniform 4's where expected cyclic 2/1/9/8 sections—missed vertical pattern variation and header omission; 0's and 9's not propagated correctly.
 * Train 3: Generated inconsistent 5/3/8 overlays with 0's and 4's, but expected structured 5-headers then 3/8 motifs in sections; row 1 has 3/8 but expected all-5 then 8's; row 6 has 3/8/3 but expected uniform 4's then 3/8/8; lower rows have 2's/4's/6's where expected all-5 or all-4—rotation and padding over-applied, frame skipping wrong.
 * get_pattern is helpful for extraction but broken: includes leading repeats incorrectly (e.g., * leading but if leading=0 just [first]), skips 0's but not always, and fails on full-frame without proper empty check.
 * rotate_left is useful but applied too broadly (e.g., on non-empties), causing pattern drift.
 * pad_pattern and map_pattern (1->4) are directionally correct but amplify errors (e.g., padding 0's leads to blank sections).
 * normalize_header only for empties but buggy: extends 5 to 3 and 3 to 6, but doesn't handle longer sequences or other numbers like 8/9; unhelpful for non-header rows.
 * apply_overlay positions (9,15,21) seem right for 3-section repeat but overwrites too much/too little, missing first 9 cols and not aligning with expected full-row fills.
 * Overall: No training passed; understanding shows vertical inheritance and sectional overlays, but misses exact extension rules, full pattern cycling, and background preservation—avoid global mapping or fixed paddings without checks.
 * Function map_pattern is simple/subtle-useful (1->4), but normalize_header is partially broken (wrong start3 calc after 5's, limited scope).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it features heavy repetition of 9's and 0's in early columns (likely unprocessed left area), with cyclic overlays of [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] in positions ~9-11/15-17/21-23 across many rows, but introduces inconsistencies like scattered 6's/3's in row 10+ and 0-blocks in rows 13-16, suggesting faulty rotation/padding on varying left inputs (e.g., test left has 9/0 mixes not extracted well).
 * It mismatches puzzle logic: Expected likely has structured 9-backgrounds with rotating 3/4/6 motifs filling sections uniformly (similar to train 2's cycles), but generated has partial overwrites (e.g., row 1 has 9,6,0 at end vs probable full pattern) and abrupt 0-rows (13-16) that should propagate prior patterns; lower rows revert to 4/3/6 cycles but with extra 6's/4's, indicating over-rotation or wrong inheritance—looks messy/incomplete, not matching vertical continuity in trainings.
 * No expected provided, but based on trainings, it should avoid 0-spillover and ensure overlays align across rows (e.g., staggering like train 1's 4/7/8); current output has too many isolated 6's and unnormalized headers, so incorrect—account for 9/6 as potential frames or mappers to fix.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (first 5 cells per row) encodes patterns or instructions (possibly frames, leading indicators, or sequences) that determine transformations or overlays applied to the main content area (crop from index 6 to 29, output as 24 elements). The goal is to process each row independently or with carry-over (e.g., rotation from previous patterns) to produce a modified grid matching expected visual structures, with final blank/edge filling using 9.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Left side (row[0:5]) uses a "frame" set {0,6,7} to detect leading non-content (e.g., borders or spacers); count leading frame elements to determine repetition of the first non-frame value, then append non-zero values from the remaining left cells—subtlety: if all left is frame or empty pattern, rotate from previous row's pattern, but this can propagate errors across rows.
 * Patterns are padded to exactly 3 elements (repeat last or use 0 if empty), then mapped (1 becomes 4, others unchanged) before overlay—easy to miss: overlay applies only to specific positions in crop (starting at index 9, then every 6 steps: 9-11, 15-17, 21-23), suggesting a 4x6 subgrid or column-wise insertion, but ignores earlier crop indices (0-8 stay as-is).
 * Carry-over via previous_pattern update only when a new pattern is detected, else use rotated version—subtlety: rotation is left-cyclic (p[1:] + [p[0]]), which may simulate shifting motifs, but fails if initial patterns are wrong, leading to cascading mismatches.
 * Final post-processing replaces 0 or 6 with 9 across the entire output row (not just crop), implying 0/6 are blanks/edges to be filled uniformly—key: this happens after overlay, so overlays can introduce non-9 values, but expected outputs show structured fills (e.g., solid 3s, 8s, or mixed 4/7/8) rather than sparse insertions.
 * Grid is 20-24 rows high, each row 30+ elements internally but cropped/output to 24; patterns seem to represent colors/shapes (e.g., 3=fill, 4=border, 7/8=patterns, 1=transformed to 4), with expectations showing symmetric or repeating motifs (e.g., rows of uniform 3s, checker-like 4/7/8).
 * Subtle across examples: Training 1 has evolving patterns (3s to 4/7/8 overlays on 3-base), Training 2 cycles 1/2 motifs into 9-base with 4/2 overlays, Training 3 mixes 5-base with 3/8 and 4/2 overlays—common: left encodes short sequences (1-3 elems), but program over-repeats or mis-rotates, leading to uniform 9-fills where structure expected.
 * Easy to miss: No global grid interactions (row-independent except pattern carry), but test input lacks provided left/crop details, so assumptions about input structure (e.g., all-9 base) may fail; outputs must preserve some original crop content while overlaying.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame 'leading' times
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function attempts to extract repeating motifs from left, useful for identifying sequence starts after frames, but flawed in repetition logic and empty handling—keep but fix for non-zero appends and frame edge cases.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cyclic shift for pattern carry-over; helpful for simulating rotation in multi-row motifs, but only useful if base patterns are correct.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads short patterns by repetition or 0; essential for consistent 3-element overlays, but 0-padding may introduce unwanted blanks before final 9-fill.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    p = pad_pattern(pattern)
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Transform 1 to 4 (possible color/shape map)
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):  # Overlays at 9-11, 15-17, 21-23 in crop
        for k in range(3):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Core overlay logic targeting right-side columns; helpful for inserting patterns into specific sub-areas, but misses left crop (0-8) and assumes crop len=24—adjust range if input varies.)

(The main program function ties these together with previous_pattern tracking and final 9-replacement; partially helpful for structure, but broken in pattern propagation and overlay scope.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs showing excessive 9-fills and misapplied overlays (e.g., sparse 4/3/7/8 insertions where expected solid blocks of 3/8 or repeating 4/7/8 patterns).
 * What worked: Basic left extraction via get_pattern correctly identifies some non-frame starts (e.g., in Train1 row3, detects 3 after leading, overlays 4s matching expected positions); overlay positions (9+) align with right-side motifs in partial matches (e.g., Train1 rows 3-5 have correct 4/7/8 spots but wrong values/context); final 9-replacement fills blanks appropriately in uniform areas (e.g., Train1 row1 ends with 9s like expected 3/5 but mismatched).
 * What didn't work: Pattern repetition over-applies leading count (e.g., Train1 row1 generates [5,5,5,...] but expected uniform 3/5 without repetition); rotation/empty handling propagates wrong patterns (e.g., Train1 rows 9-16 show repeated 4/1/8 but expected varied 4/7/8/1 with 3-edges); mapping 1->4 is inconsistent (Train2 expects 1/2 preserved in left, but overlays 4/2 wrongly); ignores original crop content fully in some rows, leading to all-9 where structure needed (e.g., Train3 rows 10-14 generate uniform 2s/4s but expected all-5s or 4-blocks).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated has fragmented 4/7/8 (e.g., row6: 7,4,4,8,8,8 but expected solid 4s); row9: 4,4,4,1,1,1 but expected 8,8,8,4,4,4 with trailing 8/3; row17: 4,4,9,8,8,8 but expected 8,8,8,4,7,4; unknown why 1s appear untransformed in some spots.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated cycles 4/2 overlays on 9-base but expected left-side 1/2/8 motifs with right 9-fills (e.g., row1: generated all-9/4/2 but expected 2,2,1,8,8,9,...); rows 14-20 show repeated 4/9 but expected repeating 2/2/1 blocks; function apply_overlay overwrites too aggressively, losing original 8/9 structure.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated mixes 5/3/8 overlays but expected symmetric 5/3/8 in specific patterns (e.g., row2: generated 3,3,3 but expected 3,8,3,3,8,3); rows 6-9: 3,8,3 repeats but expected 8,8,8 blocks with 3 edges; rows 16-20: sparse 4/9 but expected uniform 4s—pad_pattern's 0-append + 9-replace creates excess 9s.
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but broken for all-frame left (returns [] too eagerly, leading to rotations); rotate_left is neutral but unhelpful without correct base; apply_overlay positions are useful but scope too narrow (starts at 9, misses 0-8); overall program shows understanding of left->overlay flow but fails on pattern fidelity and carry-over.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken beyond flaws noted, but the previous_pattern update logic (sets to get_pattern even if rotated) creates loops of bad data—avoid in future without reset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it consists mostly of 9-fills (blank/edge) with sparse, repeating 4/3 overlays in right positions (e.g., rows 2/6/8/10 have 4,3 patterns at 9-11/15-17/21-23), suggesting over-reliance on rotation/mis-extraction from presumed left input, but lacks the structured motifs seen in training expectations (e.g., no solid blocks or symmetric 1/2/8 like Train2, instead fragmented 3/4 on 9-base).
 * Does not make sense: All rows start/end with 9s, implying heavy blank-filling or failed pattern detection (possibly test left is all-frame, triggering endless rotations of empty/3/4), but expected should mirror training variety (e.g., evolving overlays on base colors like 5/8/9); mismatches subtlety of preserving left-crop content (positions 0-8 are 9s everywhere, but training shows varied starts like 5/8/2).
 * Missing elements: No carry-over diversity (patterns stuck in 4/3 cycle, e.g., rows 4/7/12/15 repeat 9,4,3 but no 7/8/1 transforms); final 9-replace over-applies, creating uniform rows where subtle patterns (e.g., Train3's 3,8,3) expected—likely doesn't handle test's unique left sequences, leading to incorrect sparse output vs. dense expected structures.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where patterns or symbols extracted from a left border (first few columns of each row) are used to overlay, rotate, or decode elements in the main body of the grid, likely representing some form of symbolic or patterned transformation across rows, with repeating motifs like numbers 3,4,7,8 in example 1, 1,2,9 in example 2, and 3,8 in example 3.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The left border (first 5 columns per row) seems to encode patterns, but leading frames like 0,6,7 may indicate no new pattern or continuation, requiring detection of the first non-frame value to start extraction; however, this leads to incorrect overlays if rotation or padding is misapplied.
 * Patterns are short sequences (e.g., 3 elements like [4,7,8] or rotations thereof) that get applied periodically across the row (e.g., every 6 positions starting from index 9 in the cropped grid), but must preserve or interact with existing grid values rather than fully overwriting, as seen in mismatches where overlays ignore underlying structures.
 * Rotation of previous patterns occurs when a row has no new pattern (all frame values), but the rotation direction, frequency, or condition is off—e.g., in example 1, rotations should produce specific sequences like [4,4,4] then [7,4,4] but instead generate incorrect [4,4,7] variants.
 * Mapping rules are subtle: e.g., 1 maps to 4 in some contexts, but not universally, and padding with repeats (e.g., last value) fails when patterns vary in length or when empty patterns should propagate differently.
 * Grid cropping ignores the first 6 columns consistently, assuming they are borders, but this may crop too much or too little, leading to positional errors in overlays (e.g., applying at starts 9,15,21 but missing alignments).
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may reset or cycle independently per "section" of the grid (e.g., upper vs lower in example 1), and empty rows or all-5/8/9 borders indicate solid fills without overlays; also, some rows in expectations show blended values (e.g., 4's overlaying on 3's but retaining shapes), suggesting non-destructive application.
 * Across attempts, failures in propagating patterns across blank left borders cause cascading errors, like in example 2 where rotations should cycle [1,2] motifs but produce static 4's; example 3 shows failure to handle vertical alignments or section breaks.
 * Considerations: Grids have consistent width (24 after crop?), height varies (20 rows in ex1/2, but code assumes full len(g)); numbers represent colors/symbols (e.g., 3=background, 4=pattern element, 7/8=extensions); test input has repeating cycles in left (e.g., [4,3,6] rotations) suggesting a cyclic pattern puzzle.

    if not p:
        return p

    p = p[:3]
    while len(p) < 3:
        p.append(p[-1] if p else 0)
    return p  # Somewhat helpful for standardizing to 3 elements, but unhelpful if patterns are >3 or need exact lengths; causes repeats where expectations vary (e.g., [4] pads to [4,4,4] but sometimes should be [4,0,0]).
```

```python
def map_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Specific to mapping 1->4, helpful for example 1/2 where 1 appears, but irrelevant/broken for example 3 (no 1's) and test (no 1's); don't use broadly.
```

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(3):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result  # Core but broken: Overwrites absolutely without blending (e.g., expectations show partial fills like 4 on 3 but retaining 3's); starts at 9 too late/ignores offsets; step 6 assumes fixed motif width.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, with no rows matching expectations, indicating fundamental misunderstanding of pattern extraction, rotation, and overlay logic.
 * In training example 1: Generated overlays incorrect from row 5 onward—e.g., row 5 has [4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4] vs expected [4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4] (wait, similar but row 6 generated [8,8,7,4,4,4,8,8,8,7,4,4,8,8,8,7,4,4] vs expected all 4's, missing full fill; row 8 generated [4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4] vs expected [8,8,8,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4]—rotation off by one, and no blending with 8's; lower rows like 12 generated [1,1,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,8,...], mapping 1->4 but positions wrong; overall, too many 4/7/8 mixes where expectations have solid sections or different rotations (e.g., row 18 expected all 4's overlay but generated partial 3's).
 * In training example 2: Generated mostly static 4's and incorrect 2/6 inserts—e.g., row 1 [8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,2,8,8,8,4,4,2,9,9,8,4,4,2] vs expected [2,2,2,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8] (ignores left pattern [2,2,2] entirely, overlays 4/2 wrongly; rows 13-20 generate cycling 4/6 but expectations cycle [2,2,1]/[1,2,1] motifs without 4/6, suggesting no mapping needed and rotation direction wrong—generated left-rotates to 6/4/3 but expected right-cycles 1/2 patterns).
 * In training example 3: Generated inconsistent overlays and wrong fills—e.g., row 1 all 5's vs expected partial 8's on right; row 5 [3,3,8,5,...] vs expected [3,8,3,5,...] (positions swapped); row 6 [2,2,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,...] (wrong pattern start, 2 instead of 8); lower rows like 10 all 2's vs expected all 4's (rotation/padding fails to switch); function get_pattern prepends wrongly for left borders like [0,3,8], producing [3,8,3?] instead of [3,8]; crop_left_border assumes fixed 6-col border but example 3 has varying 5's/8's that should propagate as fills.
 * Missed rotation on empty left borders consistently, causing static patterns (e.g., ex1 rows 12-13 stay [1,1,1] mapped to [4,4,4] but should rotate to [8,1,1] etc.); apply_overlay overwrites without checking existing values, leading to loss of background like 3's in ex1.
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but broken for non-leading patterns (e.g., skips too many or repeats first wrongly); map_pattern is unhelpful/irrelevant for ex3 and test (no 1's, causes false 4's); pad_pattern forces 3-len but expectations have variable (e.g., ex2 [1,2] cycles without padding).
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better left parsing; previous logic assumes universal 3-element motifs but ex2 has 3-element [1,2,1] that repeats without rotation in blocks.
 * Train 1 mismatches in mid-section (rows 6-9) where generated has scattered 4/7/8 but expected solid 4's then 7-interspersed, unknown reason but likely wrong rotation trigger.
 * Train 2 has complete failure to detect [1,2,1]/[2,2,1] from left, generating 4's instead—mapping over-applied.
 * Train 3 upper half generated partial 3/8 but expected mirrored/aligned 3/8 blocks; lower half wrong fills (2's vs 4's/5's).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears nonsensical—e.g., rows 0-3 cycle [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] overlays starting at pos 9, but with inconsistent 0's and 6's in left/mid (row 0: [9's,0's,9's,6,0's]; row 10: inserts 3's wrongly at end); repeating blocks (rows 5-7 mirror 1-3 but expectations likely need cyclic rotation without overwriting 9's/0's fully, as test left has rotating [4,3,6] suggesting output should propagate that cycle across right sections without introducing extra 3's/4's in non-pattern spots (e.g., row 13 all 0's base but overlays [6,4,3] cleanly); lower rows (14-17) have 0-base with overlays, but row 18+ revert to 9-base with cycles, mismatched to expected solid sections or blended 0/6/9; overall, too many forced 4's/mappings where test has no 1's, and positions like pos 20-23 have erratic 0/3/4/6 vs likely clean cycle [4,3,6,9's]; does not account for section breaks (e.g., row 13-17 as 0-block needing different handling), making it look like over-rotated junk rather than patterned output.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where small "blobs" or non-zero patterns in the leftmost columns (0-5) of an input grid influence modifications to a base canvas extracted from the right side (columns 6+), such as color propagation, hole filling, and patterned interleaving or replacement in affected rows, ultimately producing a stylized or rule-based output grid of the same dimensions. The goal is to infer and apply consistent rules from training examples to correctly transform unseen test inputs, focusing on preserving large components while adapting small ones based on left-side cues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Affected rows are those with non-zero values in columns 0-4 (or possibly 0-5), indicating "small blobs" that trigger changes only in those rows, while unaffected rows remain mostly as in the base canvas.
 * Base canvas is typically the right 24 columns (starting from column 6), preserving large connected components (e.g., long horizontal runs of the same number) unless modified by left-side influences.
 * Propagation of colors from left blobs: Small left patterns (e.g., 1-2 cells) often replicate or extend into the left edge of the canvas in affected rows, but not always as simple fills—may involve matching shapes or alternating with dominant canvas colors.
 * Hole filling in large components: Zeros (0s) in affected rows' large blobs should be filled with the row's dominant color, but only within connected large structures; over-filling entire rows or ignoring connectivity leads to mismatches.
 * Y-range transformations: Changes vary by row position or groups (e.g., interleaving patterns like every 3rd cell with a secondary color such as 4,7, or 8), but must respect specific sequences seen in expectations (e.g., repeating triplets like 4-4-7 or 3-8-3); simple modulo-3 interleaving often distorts lengths or positions.
 * Subtle elements: Left blobs can indicate specific patterns (e.g., a single non-zero might trigger minimal changes, while pairs like 6-6 suggest extensions); large canvas components (e.g., runs of 8s or 9s) should not be fully overwritten unless explicitly cued; zeros in expectations are rare and purposeful, not always filled; row groups (e.g., upper vs. lower halves) may have thematic colors (5s top, 4s bottom); connectivity matters—treat horizontal runs as objects, but vertical alignment across rows can influence propagation.
 * Easy-to-miss: Dominant color calculation should consider only non-zero cells in the canvas row, not including left blobs initially; secondary colors for interleaving should be chosen from present canvas colors (prioritizing 4>7>8), not hardcoded; transformations must maintain exact 24-column width without truncation or padding errors; some rows in expectations show asymmetric patterns (e.g., longer runs on one side), suggesting non-uniform application.
 * All considerations: Avoid global changes—modifications are row-specific and only for affected rows; test for blob sizes (small: 1-3 cells, medium: 4-6, large: 7+ in row); potential for shape mirroring (e.g., left blob [1,1] mirrors to canvas edge); handle cases where left has no blobs (copy base unchanged); zeros might represent transparency or errors to preserve in some contexts.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt structured the program modularly with functions for base extraction, affected row detection, color propagation, hole filling, and y-range transformations, which is helpful for debugging but overall incorrect as all training examples failed.
 * What worked: Correctly identified affected rows based on left non-zeros (e.g., in training 1, rows with 7s or 5s on left were targeted); base canvas extraction preserved right-side structure initially; dominant color calculation for filling was conceptually sound but over-applied (e.g., filled entire rows instead of holes only).
 * What didn't work: Propagation was too simplistic (replicated first left color to first 3 canvas positions, but expectations show more nuanced extensions like matching blob size or interleaving with canvas colors, e.g., training 1 row 1 expected all 5s extended but generated mixed 7-3); hole filling ignored connectivity, filling all 0s row-wide (e.g., training 1 row 3 generated 8s where expected has specific 4-7-8 patterns); y-range transformations used flawed modulo-3 interleaving that skipped indices incorrectly, leading to length mismatches and wrong secondary colors (e.g., forced 4/7/8 without checking presence, distorting patterns like expected 3-4-4-7 in training 1); no blob size classification, treating all left non-zeros uniformly.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated heavy 7-3 repetition in upper rows (e.g., row 1: [7,7,3,7,7,...] vs expected [5,5,5,5,3,...] with 5-extension); lower rows filled 8s/1s incorrectly (e.g., row 9: extra 1s at end vs expected mixed 4-7-8 without trailing 1); interleaving created uneven triplets, e.g., row 3 generated [7,7,3,7,7,7,...] but expected [5,5,5,3,3,3,3,...] with no 7s.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Upper rows incorrectly propagated 1/2 to canvas left without pattern matching (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,8,8,9,...] vs expected [2,2,1,8,8,9,...] showing left blob [2,2,1?] influencing specific positions); repeated 4s/8s/9s in middle but ignored expected 1-2-1 triplets (e.g., row 2 generated uniform 8-9 but expected [1,2,1,8,8,9,...]); lower rows over-filled 6s into 9-patterns without alternation.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Top rows incorrectly introduced 3s/8s where expected solid 5s or minimal changes (e.g., row 1: [8,8,5,3,3,...] vs expected [5,5,5,5,5,...] with 3-8 only in specific right positions); bottom 4-rows filled 6s uniformly but expected preserved 4s with inserted 3-8 patterns (e.g., row 6: [4,4,4,2,2,...] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,...3,8,8,...]); no handling for unaffected rows staying solid (e.g., rows 11-14 expected all 5s but generated mixed).
 * Function `propagate_small_colors` is broken (over-replicates to fixed 3 positions, ignores blob shape/size—don't use as-is). 
 * Function `modify_holes_in_large` is partially helpful but overzealous (fills all 0s, not just holes in large blobs—refine with connectivity check). 
 * Function `apply_y_range_transformations` is unhelpful (modulo-3 logic distorts lengths and chooses wrong secondaries—replace with pattern matching from expectations). 
 * Function `identify_affected_rows` and `extract_base_canvas` are correct and essential (keep and build on them). 
 * No object extraction function was used effectively; adding blob extraction (as in helpful tools above) is needed for better propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it relies on the same flawed program that failed all training examples, producing repetitive patterns (e.g., heavy 8-9-6/1/4/7 blocks with sudden 0s in rows 13-16) that don't align with expected subtlety from training (e.g., no nuanced interleaving like 3-8-3 or 4-7-4, instead uniform fills).
 * Upper rows show over-propagation of 6/1 into 8/9/4 backgrounds (e.g., row 0: [8,8,9,6,6,...] likely from left blob influence, but too uniform vs. training's varied extensions); middle rows introduce unexplained 0s (e.g., row 13: [7,7,0,7,7,...] suggesting failed hole filling, but expectations rarely have 0s—should be filled with dominant 7 or 9).
 * Lower rows repeat upper patterns without variation (e.g., rows 17-20 mirror rows 0-3 with 8-9-6, but training shows row-specific y-range differences like upper 5s vs. lower 4s—test lacks this stratification).
 * Overall, test output lacks the patterned insertions (e.g., triplets or alternations) seen in training expectations, instead showing blocky repetitions that ignore blob sizes; it makes sense as an extension of the program's errors but is incorrect because it doesn't mentally match inferred rules (e.g., for test's apparent left 9-6/1 patterns, expect something like 9-extended with 6-6 inserted into 8/4 runs, not full left fills).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (no exceptions). I focused solely on properties like color, position (bbox), holes, and pixel count that demonstrably affect or connect to other elements in a repeatable way across all cases. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone small components without clear ties to larger structures) are excluded. Transformations that cannot be explained consistently (e.g., exact pixel count changes or non-obvious color shifts like Yellow → Blue in train 2 only) are noted as unknown rather than speculated. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is implied or attempted.

1. **Pink (left border) position → large right components' position transformation**  
   - The Pink component (color=Pink, holes=1, bbox x-start=0, width ~5-6 units, y-span full height ~0-19, pixels ~42) is consistently present in all inputs as a left-edge enclosure.  
   - It interacts with large block components (pixels >100, various colors like Green/Maroon/Orange/Yellow/Light Blue, bbox x-start ≥6, full or near-full y-height) by enabling a leftward bbox x-shift (~ -6 units, matching Pink's width). This moves the large blocks into the Pink's space (x=0+).  
   - Consistent effect: Pink disappears entirely in all outputs; large blocks preserve color and approximate y-bbox but adjust x-bbox leftward (e.g., x-start 6→0, x-end shortens proportionally). Pixel count may decrease (unknown cause, e.g., due to unmodeled overlap).  
   - No effect on small components (<20 pixels).

2. **Large right components' holes → loss/reduction in output**  
   - Large blocks (as above, x-start ≥6, pixels >100) with holes=1 in inputs (e.g., Green or Maroon) consistently interact with the shift (tied to Pink position).  
   - Effect: Holes reduce to 0 in outputs for these components (or their split parts). Pixel count and color preserved, but structure simplifies (no new holes created from these). Consistent in cases where input holes=1 (trains 1 and 3); no holes in input train 2 yields no holes in output.

3. **Small left components (position/color) → repositioning to right in output**  
   - Small components (pixels 1-17, colors like Yellow/Dark Red/Green/Red/Blue, bbox x<6, scattered y-positions) in inputs consistently interact via position (left x<6) and color.  
   - Effect: They are relocated to right-side positions (output bbox x ≥15-20, often near x-end ~23) while preserving approximate y-bbox clusters. Color usually preserved (e.g., Green → Green in train 3, Dark Red → Dark Red in train 1), but occasional unknown changes occur (e.g., some Yellow disappear or shift to Blue in train 2). Number of small components increases (replication/splitting, e.g., 1-3 input → 5+ output), pixel count per component stays low (~1-6). No interaction with large blocks' shift.

4. **Small left components' pixel count → grouping in output**  
   - Small components (as above, left x<6, low pixels) consistently interact based on input pixel count (1-17).  
   - Effect: Low-pixel singles (1-2 pixels) group or replicate into multiple similar small components in output right-side positions (total pixels increase slightly, e.g., input total ~10-20 → output ~20-50 across group). Higher input small pixels (6-17) may split into 2-3 output smalls of similar color/position. Unknown if this affects holes (none in these smalls consistently).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-color mappings beyond preservation; no consistent hole creation from smalls; y-position mappings vary too much to explain; test inputs show variations like dual Pink or taller height, but analysis is train-only). Elements like nested shapes or symmetrical patterns in the descriptions do not show clear, consistent ties to transformations across all trains.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 01:39:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing a visual layout like a calendar, diagram, or patterned image) by extracting patterns from a left border area, applying rules for mapping, padding, rotation, and special accents based on global elements like the presence of 8, and then overlaying these patterns onto the main content area while handling headers and empty sections differently. The goal is to normalize and decorate the grid to match expected outputs, possibly simulating visual effects like borders, fills, or accents in a puzzle image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a left border (first 5-6 columns) that encodes patterns for each row, with frame values {0,6,7} to skip, and non-zero values indicating the pattern (e.g., leading frames repeat the first non-frame value).
 * Crop the left 6 columns to focus on the main 24-column content area.
 * Global check for 8 in the entire cropped grid to trigger mappings (e.g., 1 -> 4).
 * For non-empty patterns, pad to exactly 3 elements by repeating the last; for empty left borders (all frames or zeros), use consecutive empty count: rotate previous pattern if 1 empty, [4,4,4] if >1, or empty if none.
 * Headers (rows with empty patterns) need normalization: extend leading 5s to exactly 3 positions, and following 3s to exactly 6 positions.
 * Special accent rule: If pattern is all 4s and grid has 8, change to [4,4,7] only if the row contains 8 (subtle: row-specific check, not global).
 * Overlay the 3-element pattern starting at column 9 (0-indexed in cropped grid), repeating every 6 columns (positions 9-11, 15-17, 21-23).
 * Subtleties: Patterns can be short (1-4 elements), leading zeros/frames create repetitions; consecutive empties propagate rotated or filled patterns; 1s only map to 4s if 8 exists globally, but this interacts with accents; headers might appear mid-grid, not just top; empty patterns don't overlay but normalize; rotations are left-shifts; padding uses last element or 0 if empty.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution), consider that patterns might not always start immediately after frames, and non-pattern values (e.g., 9,2 in ex2) require different handling than assumed (e.g., no universal mapping); empty sections can be long and need consistent filling; overlays don't affect all columns (e.g., 0-8 and 12-14 untouched except in headers).
 * Other considerations: Grids vary in theme (ex1: 3/4/5/7/8 heavy, ex2: 2/8/9 heavy, ex3: 3/5/8 heavy, test: 0/1/3/4/6/9 heavy), so rules must generalize beyond 8-specific logic; test has many 0s and 9s, suggesting borders/frames and fillers that might need ignoring or special empty handling; subtle mismatches in positions (e.g., overlays starting too early/late) break symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt shows partial understanding of left-border pattern extraction and overlay mechanics but fails all training examples due to incorrect handling of non-8 grids (ex2/ex3) and misapplied rules like accents/mappings where 8 isn't dominant.
 * Train 1: Generated extends 5s/3s correctly in header (row0 matches), applies [4,4,7] overlays well in some rows (e.g., row3/4 match accents), but mismatches in row1 (uses [4,4,7] overlay too early, expected plain 3s); row2 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected [4,4,4]); row5 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected all 4s fill); row6 ( [4,4,7] but expected [4,4,7] with 4s in non-overlay); row7 similar but expected more 4s/7s shifted; row8 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected all 8s then 4s); row9-12 (1s not fully mapped or patterned wrong, expected varied 1/4/7/8); row13 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected all 8s then [4,7,4]); row14 (similar, expected all 8s then 4s); row15-20 mismatches in 3/5 extensions and overlays (e.g., row17 expected all 4s fill, got partial overlay).
 * Train 2: Completely mismatches, as it assumes 8-presence mapping but ex2 has no 1s/4s dominance; generated overlays [4,4,7]/[4,4,2] etc. on 9/8 areas, but expected uses left patterns like [2,2,1] directly without mapping, and overlays only in specific blocks (e.g., row0 expected [2,2,1] in positions 0-2/6-8 but got 5/3/9); entire grid generated with wrong base fills (e.g., row1 got [4,4,2] but expected [2,2,2] in left/mid); no recognition of repeating [2,2,1]/[2,2,2]/[1,2,1] cycles from left border.
 * Train 3: Fails to handle 5/8/3 patterns properly; generated all-5 headers and [2,2,2]/[4,4,4] overlays, but expected mixes 3/8 in overlays/headers (e.g., row1 expected [3,8,3] repeating but got [3,3,3]); row2 expected [3,8,8] but got [8,3,8]; row5 expected [3,8,8] overlay on 4s but got all 4s; lower rows (11-15) got plain 5s/4s but expected plain 5s; bottom all-4s match but upper mismatches show poor pattern extraction for 3/8.
 * Function `normalize_header` works for ex1 row0 but overextends in ex3 (applies to non-headers); `get_pattern` skips frames ok but misses repeating non-zeros in ex2 (e.g., treats 2/1 as single); `special_accent` applies [4,4,7] too broadly in ex1 (where not all rows have 8); `map_1_to_4` irrelevant/unhelpful for ex2/ex3 (no 1s, causes wrong 4-fills); overall program composition tracks consecutive empties well but fails when patterns aren't 1/4-based.
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better left-pattern parsing beyond current `get_pattern` (e.g., handle 2/9 as direct patterns without 4-mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies [4,4,4] overlays consistently from row5 onward, but leaves many 0s/9s/6s untouched or partially overlaid (e.g., row0 has [0,0,9] in mid but expected likely normalized 9s or patterned fills based on left 0s indicating empty/header); row1-4 show rotating [1,1,6]/[1,3,6]/[3,6,1]/[4,4,4] but with 9/6/0 remnants, suggesting incomplete overlay (expected full block fills like all-9s with pattern accents, similar to ex2's 8/9 blocks); rows 14-17 all-0 left leads to [4,4,4] but with 0/6 scattered, not a clean fill (expected perhaps all-0 or propagated pattern like ex1 empties); later rows revert to [4,4,4] on 9s but end with mismatched 3/6 (e.g., row22 has 6,4,4,4 but likely expected uniform); overall, too many 0/6/9 persist, no header normalization on top 0-left rows, and no global 8 so 1s stay 1s but overlays ignore left variety (e.g., row10 left implies [4,4,4] ok, but row1's [1,1,6] not rotated properly); doesn't make sense as it looks patchy, not symmetric/blocky like expecteds.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 01:40:10] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear to interact (e.g., one affecting position, color, size, or structure of another) in **every** train example. I focused only on patterns that hold across all three pairs, ignoring isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific colors like Light Blue appear only in train 2, so excluded). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted; unexplained aspects are noted as unknown. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated large blocks without apparent ties to small elements or frames) are omitted.

1. **Pink holed frame (left border) interacts with adjacent small pixel elements via position**:
   - Consistent in all inputs: Pink (holes=1, bbox starting at [0,0,...], pixels ≈42) forms a left vertical border (x=0-5, y=0-19).
   - Interaction: Always adjacent to small (1-6 pixel, holes=0) elements in Red/Dark Red, Yellow, Green, or Blue at top-left or bottom-left positions (e.g., bbox like [1,1,3,3] or [2,17,2,19]).
   - Effect in all outputs: The Pink frame is consistently removed or transformed into a new left border strip (x=0 to ≈4-5, y=0-19, holes=0, pixels ≈19-75 per segment), with position preserved but color changed (to Orange in train 1 and 3; mixed Red/Maroon in train 2). The adjacent small elements' positions appear to "anchor" this transformation, as output border segments align with input small element y-ranges (top/mid/bottom). Specific color mapping from small elements to border is unknown.

2. **Small pixel elements (1-6 pixels, holes=0) interact with larger regions via replication and position spreading**:
   - Consistent in all inputs: 5-10 small elements (colors: Yellow, Red/Dark Red, Green, Blue, or Maroon; bbox often single points or short lines like [1,5,1,5] or [2,18,3,18]; total pixels <10 per element) clustered near left border (x=1-3, y=1-18).
   - Interaction: These always neighbor the Pink frame and/or initial large blocks (e.g., Green/Maroon/Orange with bbox starting x≥6).
   - Effect in all outputs: Small elements are consistently replicated into 10-20 new single-pixel (pixels=1, holes=0) elements, spread across the full width (x=0-23, y=0-19), often changing color (to Dark Red in train 1; Blue in train 2; Green in train 3). Positions expand rightward from input locations (e.g., input top-left Yellow at y=2-3 becomes output scattered at y=0-7; bottom Dark Red at y=18 becomes output at y=15-19). This spreading affects nearby larger regions by filling gaps or outlining them. Pixel count increase (e.g., input total small pixels ≈20-30 to output ≈30-50) is consistent, but exact replication rule (e.g., based on input pixel count or color) is unknown.

3. **Large holed regions (holes≥1) interact with small pixel elements via hole/structure modification**:
   - Consistent in all inputs: 1-2 large regions (colors: Green, Maroon; holes=1; bbox mid-right like [7,0,29,19] or [10,3,28,17]; pixels >100) with internal "holes" (likely circular/oval motifs from description), positioned right of small elements and Pink frame.
   - Interaction: Always separated from left small elements by a thin buffer (x=6-10), but overlapping in y-range (0-19).
   - Effect in all outputs: Hooled regions are consistently resized/shifted leftward (bbox x-start to 0-4, y-ranges preserved), with hole count modified (e.g., input holes=1 becomes output holes=0 in train 1 and 2; holes=1 in train 3 for Maroon). Small elements' positions correlate with new hole placements or fills (e.g., output single-pixel spreads align with former hole areas, reducing effective holes). This interaction also changes color occasionally (Green input to Yellow output in train 1; preserved in train 3). Specific trigger for hole increase/decrease (e.g., small element count) is unknown, but modification is consistent.

4. **Bottom-left Dark Red small element (2 pixels, holes=0) interacts with overall bottom row via color propagation**:
   - Consistent in all inputs: Dark Red (or Red) vertical pair (pixels=2, bbox like [2,17,2,19] or [2,18,3,18], x=2, y=17-19) at bottom-left, adjacent to Pink frame.
   - Interaction: Always at the bottom edge, near or overlapping y=18-19 of larger regions/frames.
   - Effect in all outputs: Consistently propagates to 3-6 single-pixel elements (color shifts: Dark Red in train 1; Red in train 2; absorbed into Green/Yellow in train 3) along the bottom row (y=17-19, x spread to 10-23). This affects bottom edges of large regions by adding "dots" or outlines, consistent across pairs. Color shift pattern (e.g., to match nearby large region) is unknown.

No other interactions (e.g., direct color-to-color mappings like Yellow -> Green, or position-to-hole count without small elements) were consistent across all three pairs; these often varied or lacked clear ties. Circular motifs (implied by holes) seem to interact only indirectly via the holed regions above. Grid arrangements appear emergent from the spreading in #2 but are not directly tied in every case.

[2025-10-03 01:44:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images composed of numerical values (likely representing colors, pixels, or pattern elements), where the goal is to transform or extract specific patterns, shapes, or objects from the input grid to produce a modified output grid that matches complex expected arrangements, possibly simulating rendering, cropping, or object manipulation in a stylized or symbolic way (e.g., letters, icons, or layered designs).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are 20x24 (rows x columns), with numbers like 0-9 representing distinct visual elements (e.g., 5 might be background/white, 3/4/8 patterns for shapes, 1/2 for accents or holes); patterns form asymmetric shapes that suggest letters (e.g., train1 expected looks like a stylized "A" or "H" with internal divisions using 4/7/8).
 * Subtle elements include irregular boundaries, internal fills, and overlays (e.g., train1 has nested 4/7/8 within 3/5 borders; train2 has repeating 1/2 motifs in a 8/9 field like a patterned border; train3 has sparse 3/8 intrusions into uniform 5/4 blocks, possibly like dotted lines or accents).
 * Outputs preserve grid dimensions but alter values selectively— not simple uniform fills or crops; must handle asymmetry (e.g., diagonal shifts in train1 row 2-3) and repetitions (e.g., train2's periodic 1/2/8/9 cycles every few rows).
 * Easy to miss: Non-contiguous regions (e.g., isolated 1s in train1 row11-12), vertical/horizontal mirroring or staggering (e.g., train2's 1/2 placements alternate), and background preservation (e.g., train3 keeps large 5/4 areas but inserts 3/8 precisely).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction yet, but patterns imply identifying blobs/regions (e.g., connected components of same number); cropping ignores left-side context which may contain keys or mirrors (e.g., train1 generated misses left 5/3 buildup); uniform outputs (like train3 generated) fail to capture sparse changes; test input has dense 9/0 with sparse 2/3/4/6/7, suggesting need for pattern recognition beyond slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Basic grid utility (potentially helpful for future, but not used effectively here)
def get_grid_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    """Returns (rows, cols) of the grid."""
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else (0, 0)
```

```python
# Potential for object extraction (not implemented in attempt, but essential based on patterns; could identify connected regions)
def find_connected_regions(g: List[List[int]], start_val: int, directions: List[tuple] = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]) -> List[List[tuple[int,int]]]:
    """Extracts connected components (blobs) of a given value; returns list of region coordinates. Unimplemented in attempt but key for shape detection."""
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in g]
    regions = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] == start_val and not visited[i][j]:
                region = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if 0 <= x < len(g) and 0 <= y < len(g[0]) and g[x][y] == start_val and not visited[x][y]:
                        visited[x][y] = True
                        region.append((x, y))
                        for dx, dy in directions:
                            stack.append((x + dx, y + dy))
                regions.append(region)
    return regions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt used simple cropping (remove left 6 columns) assuming main content is right-shifted, but this failed all training examples by producing sliced inputs without transformation (e.g., retained raw patterns like 5/3/8/1 in train1 but ignored expected 4/7 insertions).
 * What worked: Preserved relative row lengths and some right-side details (e.g., train1 generated correctly shows 8-heavy lower sections), but this is coincidental and not rule-based.
 * What didn't work: Completely mismatched expected outputs—train1 generated has uniform 3/8 bands without 4/7 accents (e.g., row3 generated [5,5,5,3,...] vs expected [5,5,5,3,...,4,4,4,...] with internal 4s); train2 generated uniform 8/9 stripes ignoring 1/2 motifs (e.g., all rows identical 8/9 blocks vs expected alternating 1/2 insertions every 3 rows); train3 generated solid 5/4 blocks missing sparse 3/8 (e.g., row1 all 5s vs expected mixed 5/8 at end); no understanding of pattern rules, just mechanical slice.
 * Cropping function `crop_right_part` is broken/not helpful (arbitrary 6-column cut; left side likely contains setup/context, e.g., train1 input implied to have more left structure); don't use in future without validation.
 * No object extraction attempted, but needed—patterns suggest manipulating detected shapes (e.g., filling holes with 1s in train1, or overlaying 3/8 in train3).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes (e.g., expected has irregular 4/7/8 clusters, generated keeps input 8/1 without change; unknown why, possibly no region detection).
 * Train2 omits periodic accents (1/2 as "dots" in 8/9 field; generated uniform, missing cycle).
 * Train3 ignores intrusions (3/8 as sparse overlays; generated solid, no subtlety in placement).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a naive crop (removing ~left 6-8 columns variably, retaining raw 9/0/6 with minor 2/3/4/7), producing repetitive 9/0 bands and isolated changes (e.g., row2-3 has 2/4 swaps, row10 has 3s) without transformation, which mismatches puzzle's need for pattern synthesis (e.g., expected likely reorganizes sparse elements like 2/3/4/6/7 into structured motifs within 9/0/6 background, similar to train3's 3/8 dots; current output looks like unprocessed input slice, missing any shape detection or overlay rules).
 * Test has vertical repetitions (e.g., rows 0-5 identical 9/0/6), horizontal sparsity (e.g., 2/4 only in cols 22-23 rows 2-3), and bottom variations (e.g., row23 has 4/6), suggesting rules for propagating or mirroring these (e.g., fill regions or alternate like train2), but generated ignores this for raw dump.
 * To handle test, account for background dominance (9/0 as fill) and accent propagation (e.g., extend 6s or insert based on neighbors); current output fails as it doesn't demonstrate puzzle understanding.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors, patterns, or elements in a bordered frame, and the task is to process the input grid to output a cleaned or transformed version of the interior puzzle content, preserving the overall structure but correctly interpreting or extracting the main visual elements while removing framing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * All inputs appear to have a consistent left border (first 6 columns) consisting of frame elements like 6's or other consistent values that frame the puzzle, which must be cropped to access the 24-column interior; however, simply cropping without further processing leaves the interior numbers unchanged, which does not match expectations.
 * Interiors contain patterns of numbers (e.g., 3's, 8's, 4's, 7's, 1's, 9's, 0's) that likely represent shapes, objects, or encoded visuals; expected outputs show transformations or replacements in these areas (e.g., blocks of 8's become mixed 4's/7's in train 1, uniform 9's become patterned 1's/2's in train 2), suggesting rules for decoding, filling, or recognizing connected components/blobs rather than literal copying.
 * Top and bottom rows often retain border-like values (e.g., 5's in train 1 and 3), indicating that horizontal borders may be part of the output or need selective preservation, while vertical frames (left/right) are fully removed; right borders (e.g., 6's in test) may also need cropping or handling.
 * Subtle patterns include non-uniform interiors: train 1 has irregular shapes with 1's and 8's that become more complex with 4's/7's; train 2 has repeating horizontal bands that resolve into vertical motifs with 1's/2's interrupting 9's; train 3 has solid blocks (5's and 4's) that embed finer 3/8 patterns, implying hierarchical structure or overlay rules.
 * Grids are consistently 20 rows by 24 columns post-crop, but inputs are likely 30 columns wide; no rotation, scaling, or dimension changes are needed, but connected regions (e.g., blobs of same numbers) may need extraction or replacement based on size, shape, or position.
 * Easy-to-miss: Uniform generated outputs (e.g., all 8's/9's in bands) ignore subtle interruptions or encodings in the original (e.g., 1's/2's as separators or holes); right-side elements like 6's in test may be frame remnants needing removal; 0's in test could be empty space or background, but without transformation, they persist incorrectly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, focused solely on left cropping; future attempts must address interior decoding (e.g., pattern recognition for shapes like letters/symbols); handle variable border thicknesses if present; ensure output matches exact expected values, not just dimensions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def crop_left_border(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Crops the left 6 columns (frame) from each row, assuming 30-column input, to yield 24-column interior.
    This is a necessary first step as it correctly removes the consistent left frame in all examples,
    but must be combined with interior processing for full correctness.
    """
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```

No other functions from the attempt; no extraction tools for blobs/objects were provided, but they would be essential for identifying and transforming patterns (e.g., connected components of numbers like 8's into decoded shapes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and removes the left border (6 columns of frame), which aligns with the positioning of main content in all training examples and produces the right dimensions (24 columns), but fails entirely on interior content by copying values verbatim without transformation.
 * Train 1: Generated a simple diagonal/rectangular shape of 3's filled with 8's and isolated 1's, but expected a more intricate pattern with 4's/7's replacing many 8's, 1's repositioned or expanded, and additional 4's/7's in non-8 areas (e.g., row 2 expected has 4's/3's mix where generated has all 3's; unknown why 8's map to 4/7 but likely shape decoding).
 * Train 2: Generated uniform horizontal bands of 8's interrupted only by 9's, but expected inserts 1's/2's in specific positions (e.g., row 0 expected starts [2,2,1,...] where generated has all 8's/9's; this misses patterned motifs like checkerboard or symbols in the 8/9 areas).
 * Train 3: Generated solid horizontal blocks of 5's (top/bottom) and 4's (middle), but expected embeds 3/8 patterns within those blocks (e.g., row 1 expected has 3/8 interruptions in 5's where generated is uniform 5's; row 6 expected mixes 3/8 in 4's area).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but naive cropping alone is insufficient and broken for the full problem (do not use without adding pattern recognition or mapping rules).
 * Extracting objects/blobs (not implemented) seems essential for future attempts to handle shape-based transformations, as generated outputs ignore connected regions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it merely crops the left 6 columns, resulting in a grid of 9's (likely background/frame), 0's (empty or interior space), 6's (right frame remnants), and scattered 2/3/4/7's, but based on training examples, this unchanged interior likely needs transformation (e.g., 9/0/6 patterns should decode into mixed numbers like 1/2/3/4/7/8 as in trains; scattered digits like 2/4 in row 2 may be part of shapes that get filled or replaced).
 * It preserves right-side 6's (e.g., column 19 in many rows), which may be a right border needing cropping (e.g., to 24 columns total, but test shows 24 values with 6's at end, suggesting incomplete frame removal); uniform 9's and 0's bands resemble train 2/3 generated failures, missing subtle embeddings (e.g., row 10 has 3's that might expand into patterns).
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exactly, but it does not make sense as a final puzzle solution since training shows interiors must be actively processed, not copied; account for potential right-cropping (e.g., remove last 0-6 columns if 6's are frame) and blob detection to handle isolated 0/3/7 as object starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of input grids (2D lists of integers representing colored pixels, likely 0=background, 1-9=colors) into output grids that follow specific spatial and structural rules derived from patterns in the examples. The transformations preserve certain elements like large colored blocks, small clusters, and holes while removing frames, redistributing pixels, and adjusting positions/sizes to fit a standard 20x24 canvas, often reducing complexity or pixel density.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Inputs appear to have a left-side "pink frame" (possibly color 6 or background with holes=1 property) spanning ~6 columns that must be removed by shifting the main content left, but without losing overlap or cluster details—subtlety: the frame might not always be uniform, and ignoring it can cause misalignment in subsequent steps.
 * Top-left small pixel clusters (1-5 pixels, colors like 3,4,5) need to be extracted, their colors inferred, and redistributed into sparse 1-3 pixel patterns across the top rows or canvas edges, approximating original pixel count but not exactly—easy to miss: redistribution should avoid overwriting large blocks and preserve color variety, not just cycle through one color.
 * Large colored blocks (e.g., solid regions of 4,5,8,9) must be repositioned leftward (slicing and expanding to fill ~x=0-23), split/combined if needed, and reduced in pixel count by 10-20% through overlaps or trimming, while maintaining color and hole properties (holes=0 or increased via filling)—subtlety: expansion shouldn't fill gaps with arbitrary colors (e.g., propagating previous color blindly); instead, resolve overlaps by priority (e.g., foreground over background) and ensure no uniform filling with a single color like 3.
 * Bottom small dark red elements (color 7, often 2-4 pixels in pairs) from input bottom rows should be placed/shifted rightward into the output's bottom 1-2 rows, typically 2-4 instances—key: count and position based on input occurrences, but avoid overplacing or ignoring row overlaps.
 * Shapes with holes (especially large ones with holes=1) need modification: map to outputs with holes=0 or more, propagate/fill using nearby cluster colors, and reduce pixel count by 20-50% via overwriting or trimming—subtlety: filling shouldn't use arbitrary colors (e.g., hard-coded 3); instead, use context from input (e.g., green=3 or 5), and avoid global overwrites that turn everything uniform.
 * Overall canvas is consistently 20 rows x 24 columns; background is often 3 (light green?) or 0, but outputs mix backgrounds strategically—easy to miss: preserve asymmetry and patterns (e.g., interspersed 1's,2's for holes or dividers); pixel reduction is approximate, not exact; rules interact (e.g., redistribution after frame removal, before block repositioning).
 * Common pitfalls: Over-filling with background color 3 (seen in all attempts, creating solid top rows); introducing 0's in test output (likely invalid, as expected outputs avoid raw 0's); ignoring hole propagation (e.g., 1's in expected as hole markers); not handling variable block sizes/splits (e.g., expected has dotted patterns like 4-7-4, not solid blocks).
 * Considerations across attempts: Rules must be applied sequentially but with input references preserved (e.g., don't modify g in place); count pixels/holes accurately (e.g., sum non-0/6 in regions); handle no-cluster cases gracefully; subtle color mappings (e.g., 7= dark red, 6=pink/frame, 8/9=large blocks, 4/5=medium shapes).

* Note: extract_large_blocks is a helpful skeleton but needs full flood-fill implementation for accuracy (current program lacks this, leading to blind slicing).
* count_bottom_elements is useful and partially correct in the original place_bottom_dark_red, but ignores rightward shift logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, producing grids with excessive uniform 3's in top 4 rows (generated solid [3]*24, expected has patterned 5's,3's,4's,2's,1's), indicating broken remove_pink_frame or initial out creation—likely assumes wrong width (out_w = w-6) without padding to 24 cols.
 * redistribute_top_left_cluster worked partially in extracting colors but failed in placement: cycles colors into fixed starts [0,6,12,18] creating repetitive 1-3 pixel groups, but overwrites large areas incorrectly (e.g., Train1 generated scattered 3's/5's/4's in top, expected has structured top-left 5's block); num_pix logic is arbitrary and doesn't approximate count.
 * reposition_large_blocks is broken: simulates expansion by propagating colors left-to-right (filling 0's with prev), but introduces uniform fills (e.g., Train1 has solid 3's propagating, expected has irregular 8's/4's with 7's holes); pixel loss via arbitrary 10% overwrite to neighbor is unhelpful and creates artifacts (e.g., Train2 solid 8/9 blocks without 1/2 dividers); doesn't actually split/combine or handle overlaps properly.
 * place_bottom_dark_red partially works: counts bottom 7's correctly but places too many (min(4,max(2,count))) in fixed right position (start_j=24-num_place), duplicating in two rows—Train1 placed [7,7] at end but expected has scattered 7's integrated into patterns; Train3 placed [7,7] but expected has no bottom 7's, showing over-placement when input lacks them.
 * modify_shape_holes is unhelpful/broken: hard-codes fill to 3 (green), overwrites ~20% non-zero globally without hole detection, leading to uniform reduction (e.g., Train1 overwrote to 3's everywhere, expected preserves detailed 1's/7's; Train2/3 similar uniform 4's/5's); ignores input holes=1 mapping, causing loss of structure (e.g., expected holes via 1's or gaps not filled arbitrarily).
 * Overall: Program assumes fixed 6-col frame removal without verification (works if present, but test has no clear frame); sequential application loses input context (e.g., g not passed consistently); no object extraction, so rules are blind operations—essential for handling variable inputs; Train1 mismatches blob shapes (e.g., expected complex 4-7-8 weave, generated solid 8's with wrong 1's); Train2 misses small 1/2 patterns (generated solid 8/9, expected dotted 2-1-2 dividers); Train3 ignores top 5's patterning (generated solid 5's row, expected interspersed 3/8 holes); subtle: all generated have trailing 3's on right, expected fills canvas fully without them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Top 6 rows are solid 3's (likely from unhandled empty space post-frame removal or bad init), while expected should start with patterned large blocks (e.g., similar to Train3's top 5's with 8's holes)—this uniform fill ignores any top clusters. Middle has solid 9's blocks (rows 6-12,18-31? but grid is 20x24, output shows 32 rows? likely formatting error, but assumes solid expansion without splits/holes). Rows 13-16 have 0's (raw background, invalid as expected avoids 0's, using 3 instead), breaking continuity. Bottom has 6's blocks with stray 4's and 7's (e.g., row 30 has 6,6,4,4,6,6; rows 31-32 have 7's), but placement seems arbitrary—not right-shifted bottom 7's, and 6's (pink?) shouldn't persist post-frame removal. Overall, lacks reduction (solid blocks > expected sparse), no hole filling (0's unfilled), and doesn't match expected style of integrated patterns (e.g., 9's with 6/7/4 interspersions); test input has vertical 9's tower left, horizontal 6's right/mid, bottom 0's and 7's—output should shift 9's left, redistribute any top clusters into top, fill 0's with 3 or clusters, place 2-4 7's bottom-right, reduce 9/6 density by 20%.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where the left portion of each row (likely columns 0-5) encodes a pattern or rule that must be extracted and applied as an overlay or transformation to the cropped main content area (likely columns 6-29, producing 24 elements per row). The goal is to generate a modified output grid that matches expected transformations, involving header normalizations, pattern cycling for empty rows, and periodic overlays, but the current approach misapplies these rules leading to mismatches in pattern propagation, header extensions, and overlay positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 columns, ignoring or framing with specific values like 0,6,7; leading frames determine repetition, and non-zero values after form the core pattern, but this fails when patterns shift or cycle incorrectly across consecutive empty rows.
 * Header normalization extends initial runs of 5's to exactly 3 cells and 3's to 6 cells by overwriting subsequent cells, but this is applied universally without checking row context, leading to over-extension or incorrect starts (e.g., turning partial 5's into full 3's prematurely).
 * Overlays apply a 3-element pattern (padded/repeated if short, with 1's mapped to 4's) starting at index 9 of the crop, repeating every 6 positions for the first 3 slots of each block, but this ignores varying block structures, deeper pattern rotations (e.g., [1:] + [0] for cycles), and doesn't handle cases where patterns evolve mid-grid or interact with existing content like 8's or 9's.
 * Consecutive empty patterns (no non-frame values in left) carry the previous pattern but cycle it (e.g., rotate left by 1), resetting counter on new patterns; however, the cycle logic only triggers after >1 empty, which misses single-empty carries and fails on long sequences.
 * Crop is always row[6:30] (24 elements), assuming fixed width; outputs must preserve this length without introducing 0's unless they are part of the expected transformation.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may need to be derived from cumulative or row-spanning logic (e.g., vertical alignment across rows), 1's specifically map to 4's in overlays but not elsewhere, and certain values like 8's or 9's act as backgrounds that overlays replace selectively; empty lefts don't always cycle but may default to all-5 or all-3 headers.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show progressive shifts (e.g., 5's shrinking, 3's expanding, overlays inserting 4/7/8 blocks), suggesting rules tied to row index or global progression, not just per-row left extraction.
 * Avoid universal normalization—some rows in expected have irregular headers (e.g., single 5's or mixed 3/8 without extension); overlays may start earlier/later or apply to different strides based on pattern length.
 * 0's in left indicate frames/empties but should not propagate to output crops unless expected; test inputs have 0's in crops, which generated outputs retain incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract pattern from left 5 columns based on leading frame colors (0,6,7)."""
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    leading = 0
    i = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []  # Empty pattern
    first = left[i]
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function partially works for identifying leading repeats but fails on complex lefts with mixed non-frames; useful as a starting point for extraction but needs refinement for cycling.)

```python
def normalize_header(crop: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extend initial runs of 5 and 3 to 3 and 6 respectively by overwriting next cells."""
    crop = crop[:]  # Copy
    # Extend 5's to 3
    num5 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 5
    # Re-find and extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(crop) and crop[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    num3 = 0
    i = start3
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 3
    return crop
```
(This is broken for rows without initial 5/3 runs, as it forces extensions where expected outputs have different starts like 8's or 4's; not helpful without conditional application based on left pattern.)

```python
def apply_overlay(crop: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Apply pattern overlay starting from position 9, every 6 positions, replacing first 3."""
    p = pattern[:]
    while len(p) < 3 and p:
        p.append(p[-1])
    p = p[:3]
    result = crop[:]
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Map 1's to 4's
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(3):
            if start + k < 24:
                result[start + k] = p[k]
    return result
```
(This overlays too rigidly at fixed starts/stride, ignoring expected variations like shifting to positions 0-8 or different repeats; unhelpful for dynamic patterns, e.g., rotating 7/8 blocks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the crop as row[6:30] and handles basic pattern extraction from left, with consecutive empty logic attempting carry-over, but fails overall as all training examples are incorrect.
 * For Training 1: Rows 0-1 match expected headers exactly ([5x5 + 3x22 +5x2] and [5x4 +3x20]), but row 2 mismatches from pos 9-11 (generated 4,4,4 vs expected 3,3,3) and pos 18-20 (3,3,3 vs 4,4,4), showing overlay wrongly inserts 4's where 3's should persist; row 4 mismatches pos 10 (7 vs nothing, expected has 4,7,4 but generated shifts); row 5 major mismatch (generated 4,7,4,8x3 vs expected 5,5,3x5,8x2 + all 4's), indicating failed header shrink and wrong overlay cycle; later rows like 8-12 insert 1's/4's incorrectly where expected has 8's/3's evolving vertically; row 17 has 6's where expected has 3's/8's, suggesting pattern misderivation from left.
 * For Training 2: Almost no matches—row 0 generated [5x3,3x6,9,8x5,9x4,8x4] vs expected [2x2,1,8x2,9,2x2,1,9,8x5,9x4,8x4], wrong headers and overlays (9/8 blocks overwritten incorrectly); row 1 has 4's/2's where expected has 2's/9's, showing 1->4 map applied wrongly and pattern [4,4,2] not matching expected [2,2,2]; repetitive 4/8/9 blocks in rows 5-12 ignore expected cycling of 1/2 patterns; row 13 introduces 6's mismatched to expected 2's, indicating broken cycling for empties.
 * For Training 3: Row 0 all 5's matches, but row 1 generated [5x9,3x3,5x3,3x3,5x3,3x3] vs expected [5x15,3,8,3x2,8,3x2,8,3], wrong extension of 3's and missing 8 insertions; row 2 has 8,3,8 repeats where expected has 3,8x2,3 etc., close but shifted; rows 5-9 mismatch overlays (e.g., row 5 generated 3x6 +8,4x3 etc. vs expected 4x15,3,8x2,4x3,3,8x2), failing to propagate 4's fully; rows 15-19 repetitive 4/6 but expected all 4's, showing over-application of patterns.
 * get_pattern is somewhat helpful for simple lefts but broken for frames with embedded non-zeros or when leading != repeat count.
 * normalize_header is not helpful—overwrites too aggressively, causing header mismatches in all examples where expected has non-extended or alternative starts (e.g., direct 8's in train3).
 * apply_overlay is incorrect—fixed range(9,24,6) misses early overlays (e.g., pos 0 in some expected) and doesn't rotate patterns per row, leading to static repeats; don't use without dynamic start/stride.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of cropping and left extraction but misses vertical/global pattern evolution, conditional normalization, and flexible overlays; consecutive_empty >1 for cycling is too strict, as some expected carries happen on first empty.
 * No functions for vertical alignment or cumulative patterns, which seems essential given row-to-row progressions in expected (e.g., shrinking 5's, expanding 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it retains many 0's from the input crop (e.g., row 0 pos 9-11=0,0,9... but ends with 6,0x4, introducing artifacts not in training expecteds, which avoid 0's in structured blocks), suggesting failed overwriting or pattern application leaves empties untouched.
 * Headers are mostly [5x3,3x6] which may be right for some rows, but overlays insert inconsistent 4/6/3/9 blocks (e.g., row 1: 4,4,6,9x3,4,4,6,9,6,0,4,4,6 with lingering 0's and mismatched 6's where patterns cycle wrongly); row 4 has 3,6,4 repeats but expected likely needs full 9/6 propagation without 0's.
 * Later rows like 13-17 have 0's in pos 12-14/18 (e.g., 3,6,4,0x3,3,6,4,0,6,0,3,6,4), which looks like incomplete overlays or failed normalization, not matching clean block structures in training expecteds (e.g., no 0's, full 3/4/8/9 fills).
 * Row 26 has [5x3,3x6,4x3,9x3,4x3,4,9,6,0,4x3] with 0's and partial 6's, indicating the cycling/overlay logic breaks on long sequences, producing messy outputs unlike expected uniform transformations.
 * Overall, test output makes no sense as a solved puzzle—too many 0's and irregularities suggest the program doesn't fully transform the crop, missing core rules like complete replacement or background filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors, shapes, or symbols in a larger image) where the left margin (first 5-6 columns) of each row encodes instructions or patterns that must be extracted, processed (e.g., rotated, mapped, normalized), and overlaid onto the main body of the grid (columns 6-30, cropped to 24 elements) to complete or transform the image according to repeating or propagating rules. The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, such as extending headers, filling sections with rotated motifs, or applying cyclic overlays, while handling special cases like empty patterns or frame elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 elements of each row; elements 0,6,7 seem to act as "frame" or ignore markers that skip leading positions, but only if they don't fill the entire left side—subtlety: if the entire left is frame, return empty and rotate the previous row's pattern.
 * Empty patterns (all frame or invalid) inherit and rotate the previous row's pattern leftward (cycle shift), but this rotation must preserve length and only apply when needed; easy to miss: rotation happens before mapping/padding, and original length tracks for header normalization.
 * Mapping rule: 1 specifically maps to 4, while other values pass through—subtlety: this is likely a color/symbol substitution, but only for certain extracted elements; don't apply globally.
 * Padding: Patterns shorter than 3 are padded by repeating the last element (or 0 if empty), then truncated to exactly 3—key: this ensures consistent overlay size, but over-padding can cause repetition errors in longer sections.
 * Normalization for headers: Rows with empty patterns (original_len==0) extend leading 5's to exactly 3 positions (overwriting if needed), then extend following 3's to exactly 6 positions—subtlety: this only applies to "header" rows without patterns; it doesn't touch other numbers, and extensions stop at row length (24 after crop).
 * Overlay application: Patterns (padded to 3) are stamped starting at positions 9,15,21 (0-indexed in the 24-element cropped row), overwriting existing values—easy to miss: this creates 3 repeating sections per row, but only if pos <24; it ignores the first 9 positions (likely a fixed left area) and assumes crop starts at original index 6.
 * Grid structure: Input g has rows of at least 30 elements; output is cropped to [6:30] (24 elems) per row, height preserved; patterns propagate vertically via previous_pattern, so row dependencies are crucial—subtlety: no horizontal propagation, but vertical inheritance can create staggered or rotating motifs across rows.
 * Special numbers: 5 often acts as a header/start marker (extends to 3), 3 as a filler/extender (to 6), 8/9 as backgrounds or walls; 4,6,7 as pattern elements; 0/1/2 as placeholders or holes—key: overlays can overwrite these, but extractions must avoid frame pollution.
 * Edge cases: Full-empty rows rotate prior; leading non-frame starts pattern immediately; if leading==0, pattern is just [first]; append non-zero from rest of left—subtlety: this skips 0's in extraction but includes them in patterns sometimes, leading to 0-padding issues.
 * Overall rules: Transform preserves structure but fills/completes sections based on left cues; mismatches often from incorrect extraction (e.g., including frame), wrong rotation timing, or overlay positions; consider vertical continuity and exact length enforcement to avoid spillover.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This extracts patterns by skipping leading frame elements and building from first non-frame, appending non-zeros; useful for left-margin parsing, but buggy on full-frame or mixed 0/non-0.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cycle shift for inheritance; helpful for propagating patterns vertically, but needs careful application only on empties.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads to fixed overlay size; useful, but repetition can amplify errors if pattern is wrong.)

```python
def normalize_header(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    row = row[:]
    # Extend 5's to 3
    i = 0
    num5 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 5
    # Extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(row) and row[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    i = start3
    num3 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 3
    return row
```
(Handles header extension for empty-pattern rows; partially useful for 5/3 rules, but limited to leading sequences and doesn't handle other fillers like 8/9.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(len(p)):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Stamps pattern in sections 9-11,15-17,21-23; core for filling, but assumes p len=3 and fixed starts—helpful if positions are correct.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of left-extraction and overlay but incorrect pattern building, rotation, and normalization.
 * Train 1: Generated short/incomplete 3-extensions (e.g., first row has only four 3's then 0's, but expected 20+ 3's across sections with trailing 5's); mismatched overlays like row 5 having scattered 7/8 instead of uniform 4's, row 8 having 1's in wrong spots vs expected 4's/8's; row 9 has 1's and 4's but expected mixed 8/4/7 with 3-end; unknown why 1's appear (from unmapped extraction?) and rotations don't align vertical motifs.
 * Train 2: Generated repetitive 4's/2's/6's in overlays but ignores left patterns like 2/1/8/9; first row starts with 5/3 but expected 2/1/8/9 blocks; many rows have uniform 4's where expected cyclic 2/1/9/8 sections—missed vertical pattern variation and header omission; 0's and 9's not propagated correctly.
 * Train 3: Generated inconsistent 5/3/8 overlays with 0's and 4's, but expected structured 5-headers then 3/8 motifs in sections; row 1 has 3/8 but expected all-5 then 8's; row 6 has 3/8/3 but expected uniform 4's then 3/8/8; lower rows have 2's/4's/6's where expected all-5 or all-4—rotation and padding over-applied, frame skipping wrong.
 * get_pattern is helpful for extraction but broken: includes leading repeats incorrectly (e.g., * leading but if leading=0 just [first]), skips 0's but not always, and fails on full-frame without proper empty check.
 * rotate_left is useful but applied too broadly (e.g., on non-empties), causing pattern drift.
 * pad_pattern and map_pattern (1->4) are directionally correct but amplify errors (e.g., padding 0's leads to blank sections).
 * normalize_header only for empties but buggy: extends 5 to 3 and 3 to 6, but doesn't handle longer sequences or other numbers like 8/9; unhelpful for non-header rows.
 * apply_overlay positions (9,15,21) seem right for 3-section repeat but overwrites too much/too little, missing first 9 cols and not aligning with expected full-row fills.
 * Overall: No training passed; understanding shows vertical inheritance and sectional overlays, but misses exact extension rules, full pattern cycling, and background preservation—avoid global mapping or fixed paddings without checks.
 * Function map_pattern is simple/subtle-useful (1->4), but normalize_header is partially broken (wrong start3 calc after 5's, limited scope).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it features heavy repetition of 9's and 0's in early columns (likely unprocessed left area), with cyclic overlays of [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] in positions ~9-11/15-17/21-23 across many rows, but introduces inconsistencies like scattered 6's/3's in row 10+ and 0-blocks in rows 13-16, suggesting faulty rotation/padding on varying left inputs (e.g., test left has 9/0 mixes not extracted well).
 * It mismatches puzzle logic: Expected likely has structured 9-backgrounds with rotating 3/4/6 motifs filling sections uniformly (similar to train 2's cycles), but generated has partial overwrites (e.g., row 1 has 9,6,0 at end vs probable full pattern) and abrupt 0-rows (13-16) that should propagate prior patterns; lower rows revert to 4/3/6 cycles but with extra 6's/4's, indicating over-rotation or wrong inheritance—looks messy/incomplete, not matching vertical continuity in trainings.
 * No expected provided, but based on trainings, it should avoid 0-spillover and ensure overlays align across rows (e.g., staggering like train 1's 4/7/8); current output has too many isolated 6's and unnormalized headers, so incorrect—account for 9/6 as potential frames or mappers to fix.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (first 5 cells per row) encodes patterns or instructions (possibly frames, leading indicators, or sequences) that determine transformations or overlays applied to the main content area (crop from index 6 to 29, output as 24 elements). The goal is to process each row independently or with carry-over (e.g., rotation from previous patterns) to produce a modified grid matching expected visual structures, with final blank/edge filling using 9.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Left side (row[0:5]) uses a "frame" set {0,6,7} to detect leading non-content (e.g., borders or spacers); count leading frame elements to determine repetition of the first non-frame value, then append non-zero values from the remaining left cells—subtlety: if all left is frame or empty pattern, rotate from previous row's pattern, but this can propagate errors across rows.
 * Patterns are padded to exactly 3 elements (repeat last or use 0 if empty), then mapped (1 becomes 4, others unchanged) before overlay—easy to miss: overlay applies only to specific positions in crop (starting at index 9, then every 6 steps: 9-11, 15-17, 21-23), suggesting a 4x6 subgrid or column-wise insertion, but ignores earlier crop indices (0-8 stay as-is).
 * Carry-over via previous_pattern update only when a new pattern is detected, else use rotated version—subtlety: rotation is left-cyclic (p[1:] + [p[0]]), which may simulate shifting motifs, but fails if initial patterns are wrong, leading to cascading mismatches.
 * Final post-processing replaces 0 or 6 with 9 across the entire output row (not just crop), implying 0/6 are blanks/edges to be filled uniformly—key: this happens after overlay, so overlays can introduce non-9 values, but expected outputs show structured fills (e.g., solid 3s, 8s, or mixed 4/7/8) rather than sparse insertions.
 * Grid is 20-24 rows high, each row 30+ elements internally but cropped/output to 24; patterns seem to represent colors/shapes (e.g., 3=fill, 4=border, 7/8=patterns, 1=transformed to 4), with expectations showing symmetric or repeating motifs (e.g., rows of uniform 3s, checker-like 4/7/8).
 * Subtle across examples: Training 1 has evolving patterns (3s to 4/7/8 overlays on 3-base), Training 2 cycles 1/2 motifs into 9-base with 4/2 overlays, Training 3 mixes 5-base with 3/8 and 4/2 overlays—common: left encodes short sequences (1-3 elems), but program over-repeats or mis-rotates, leading to uniform 9-fills where structure expected.
 * Easy to miss: No global grid interactions (row-independent except pattern carry), but test input lacks provided left/crop details, so assumptions about input structure (e.g., all-9 base) may fail; outputs must preserve some original crop content while overlaying.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame 'leading' times
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function attempts to extract repeating motifs from left, useful for identifying sequence starts after frames, but flawed in repetition logic and empty handling—keep but fix for non-zero appends and frame edge cases.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cyclic shift for pattern carry-over; helpful for simulating rotation in multi-row motifs, but only useful if base patterns are correct.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads short patterns by repetition or 0; essential for consistent 3-element overlays, but 0-padding may introduce unwanted blanks before final 9-fill.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    p = pad_pattern(pattern)
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Transform 1 to 4 (possible color/shape map)
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):  # Overlays at 9-11, 15-17, 21-23 in crop
        for k in range(3):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Core overlay logic targeting right-side columns; helpful for inserting patterns into specific sub-areas, but misses left crop (0-8) and assumes crop len=24—adjust range if input varies.)

(The main program function ties these together with previous_pattern tracking and final 9-replacement; partially helpful for structure, but broken in pattern propagation and overlay scope.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs showing excessive 9-fills and misapplied overlays (e.g., sparse 4/3/7/8 insertions where expected solid blocks of 3/8 or repeating 4/7/8 patterns).
 * What worked: Basic left extraction via get_pattern correctly identifies some non-frame starts (e.g., in Train1 row3, detects 3 after leading, overlays 4s matching expected positions); overlay positions (9+) align with right-side motifs in partial matches (e.g., Train1 rows 3-5 have correct 4/7/8 spots but wrong values/context); final 9-replacement fills blanks appropriately in uniform areas (e.g., Train1 row1 ends with 9s like expected 3/5 but mismatched).
 * What didn't work: Pattern repetition over-applies leading count (e.g., Train1 row1 generates [5,5,5,...] but expected uniform 3/5 without repetition); rotation/empty handling propagates wrong patterns (e.g., Train1 rows 9-16 show repeated 4/1/8 but expected varied 4/7/8/1 with 3-edges); mapping 1->4 is inconsistent (Train2 expects 1/2 preserved in left, but overlays 4/2 wrongly); ignores original crop content fully in some rows, leading to all-9 where structure needed (e.g., Train3 rows 10-14 generate uniform 2s/4s but expected all-5s or 4-blocks).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated has fragmented 4/7/8 (e.g., row6: 7,4,4,8,8,8 but expected solid 4s); row9: 4,4,4,1,1,1 but expected 8,8,8,4,4,4 with trailing 8/3; row17: 4,4,9,8,8,8 but expected 8,8,8,4,7,4; unknown why 1s appear untransformed in some spots.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated cycles 4/2 overlays on 9-base but expected left-side 1/2/8 motifs with right 9-fills (e.g., row1: generated all-9/4/2 but expected 2,2,1,8,8,9,...); rows 14-20 show repeated 4/9 but expected repeating 2/2/1 blocks; function apply_overlay overwrites too aggressively, losing original 8/9 structure.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated mixes 5/3/8 overlays but expected symmetric 5/3/8 in specific patterns (e.g., row2: generated 3,3,3 but expected 3,8,3,3,8,3); rows 6-9: 3,8,3 repeats but expected 8,8,8 blocks with 3 edges; rows 16-20: sparse 4/9 but expected uniform 4s—pad_pattern's 0-append + 9-replace creates excess 9s.
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but broken for all-frame left (returns [] too eagerly, leading to rotations); rotate_left is neutral but unhelpful without correct base; apply_overlay positions are useful but scope too narrow (starts at 9, misses 0-8); overall program shows understanding of left->overlay flow but fails on pattern fidelity and carry-over.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken beyond flaws noted, but the previous_pattern update logic (sets to get_pattern even if rotated) creates loops of bad data—avoid in future without reset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it consists mostly of 9-fills (blank/edge) with sparse, repeating 4/3 overlays in right positions (e.g., rows 2/6/8/10 have 4,3 patterns at 9-11/15-17/21-23), suggesting over-reliance on rotation/mis-extraction from presumed left input, but lacks the structured motifs seen in training expectations (e.g., no solid blocks or symmetric 1/2/8 like Train2, instead fragmented 3/4 on 9-base).
 * Does not make sense: All rows start/end with 9s, implying heavy blank-filling or failed pattern detection (possibly test left is all-frame, triggering endless rotations of empty/3/4), but expected should mirror training variety (e.g., evolving overlays on base colors like 5/8/9); mismatches subtlety of preserving left-crop content (positions 0-8 are 9s everywhere, but training shows varied starts like 5/8/2).
 * Missing elements: No carry-over diversity (patterns stuck in 4/3 cycle, e.g., rows 4/7/12/15 repeat 9,4,3 but no 7/8/1 transforms); final 9-replace over-applies, creating uniform rows where subtle patterns (e.g., Train3's 3,8,3) expected—likely doesn't handle test's unique left sequences, leading to incorrect sparse output vs. dense expected structures.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where patterns or symbols extracted from a left border (first few columns of each row) are used to overlay, rotate, or decode elements in the main body of the grid, likely representing some form of symbolic or patterned transformation across rows, with repeating motifs like numbers 3,4,7,8 in example 1, 1,2,9 in example 2, and 3,8 in example 3.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The left border (first 5 columns per row) seems to encode patterns, but leading frames like 0,6,7 may indicate no new pattern or continuation, requiring detection of the first non-frame value to start extraction; however, this leads to incorrect overlays if rotation or padding is misapplied.
 * Patterns are short sequences (e.g., 3 elements like [4,7,8] or rotations thereof) that get applied periodically across the row (e.g., every 6 positions starting from index 9 in the cropped grid), but must preserve or interact with existing grid values rather than fully overwriting, as seen in mismatches where overlays ignore underlying structures.
 * Rotation of previous patterns occurs when a row has no new pattern (all frame values), but the rotation direction, frequency, or condition is off—e.g., in example 1, rotations should produce specific sequences like [4,4,4] then [7,4,4] but instead generate incorrect [4,4,7] variants.
 * Mapping rules are subtle: e.g., 1 maps to 4 in some contexts, but not universally, and padding with repeats (e.g., last value) fails when patterns vary in length or when empty patterns should propagate differently.
 * Grid cropping ignores the first 6 columns consistently, assuming they are borders, but this may crop too much or too little, leading to positional errors in overlays (e.g., applying at starts 9,15,21 but missing alignments).
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may reset or cycle independently per "section" of the grid (e.g., upper vs lower in example 1), and empty rows or all-5/8/9 borders indicate solid fills without overlays; also, some rows in expectations show blended values (e.g., 4's overlaying on 3's but retaining shapes), suggesting non-destructive application.
 * Across attempts, failures in propagating patterns across blank left borders cause cascading errors, like in example 2 where rotations should cycle [1,2] motifs but produce static 4's; example 3 shows failure to handle vertical alignments or section breaks.
 * Considerations: Grids have consistent width (24 after crop?), height varies (20 rows in ex1/2, but code assumes full len(g)); numbers represent colors/symbols (e.g., 3=background, 4=pattern element, 7/8=extensions); test input has repeating cycles in left (e.g., [4,3,6] rotations) suggesting a cyclic pattern puzzle.

    return p  # Somewhat helpful for standardizing to 3 elements, but unhelpful if patterns are >3 or need exact lengths; causes repeats where expectations vary (e.g., [4] pads to [4,4,4] but sometimes should be [4,0,0]).
```

```python
def map_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Specific to mapping 1->4, helpful for example 1/2 where 1 appears, but irrelevant/broken for example 3 (no 1's) and test (no 1's); don't use broadly.

    return result  # Core but broken: Overwrites absolutely without blending (e.g., expectations show partial fills like 4 on 3 but retaining 3's); starts at 9 too late/ignores offsets; step 6 assumes fixed motif width.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, with no rows matching expectations, indicating fundamental misunderstanding of pattern extraction, rotation, and overlay logic.
 * In training example 1: Generated overlays incorrect from row 5 onward—e.g., row 5 has [4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4] vs expected [4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4] (wait, similar but row 6 generated [8,8,7,4,4,4,8,8,8,7,4,4,8,8,8,7,4,4] vs expected all 4's, missing full fill; row 8 generated [4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4] vs expected [8,8,8,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4]—rotation off by one, and no blending with 8's; lower rows like 12 generated [1,1,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,8,...], mapping 1->4 but positions wrong; overall, too many 4/7/8 mixes where expectations have solid sections or different rotations (e.g., row 18 expected all 4's overlay but generated partial 3's).
 * In training example 2: Generated mostly static 4's and incorrect 2/6 inserts—e.g., row 1 [8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,2,8,8,8,4,4,2,9,9,8,4,4,2] vs expected [2,2,2,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8] (ignores left pattern [2,2,2] entirely, overlays 4/2 wrongly; rows 13-20 generate cycling 4/6 but expectations cycle [2,2,1]/[1,2,1] motifs without 4/6, suggesting no mapping needed and rotation direction wrong—generated left-rotates to 6/4/3 but expected right-cycles 1/2 patterns).
 * In training example 3: Generated inconsistent overlays and wrong fills—e.g., row 1 all 5's vs expected partial 8's on right; row 5 [3,3,8,5,...] vs expected [3,8,3,5,...] (positions swapped); row 6 [2,2,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,...] (wrong pattern start, 2 instead of 8); lower rows like 10 all 2's vs expected all 4's (rotation/padding fails to switch); function get_pattern prepends wrongly for left borders like [0,3,8], producing [3,8,3?] instead of [3,8]; crop_left_border assumes fixed 6-col border but example 3 has varying 5's/8's that should propagate as fills.
 * Missed rotation on empty left borders consistently, causing static patterns (e.g., ex1 rows 12-13 stay [1,1,1] mapped to [4,4,4] but should rotate to [8,1,1] etc.); apply_overlay overwrites without checking existing values, leading to loss of background like 3's in ex1.
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but broken for non-leading patterns (e.g., skips too many or repeats first wrongly); map_pattern is unhelpful/irrelevant for ex3 and test (no 1's, causes false 4's); pad_pattern forces 3-len but expectations have variable (e.g., ex2 [1,2] cycles without padding).
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better left parsing; previous logic assumes universal 3-element motifs but ex2 has 3-element [1,2,1] that repeats without rotation in blocks.
 * Train 1 mismatches in mid-section (rows 6-9) where generated has scattered 4/7/8 but expected solid 4's then 7-interspersed, unknown reason but likely wrong rotation trigger.
 * Train 2 has complete failure to detect [1,2,1]/[2,2,1] from left, generating 4's instead—mapping over-applied.
 * Train 3 upper half generated partial 3/8 but expected mirrored/aligned 3/8 blocks; lower half wrong fills (2's vs 4's/5's).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears nonsensical—e.g., rows 0-3 cycle [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] overlays starting at pos 9, but with inconsistent 0's and 6's in left/mid (row 0: [9's,0's,9's,6,0's]; row 10: inserts 3's wrongly at end); repeating blocks (rows 5-7 mirror 1-3 but expectations likely need cyclic rotation without overwriting 9's/0's fully, as test left has rotating [4,3,6] suggesting output should propagate that cycle across right sections without introducing extra 3's/4's in non-pattern spots (e.g., row 13 all 0's base but overlays [6,4,3] cleanly); lower rows (14-17) have 0-base with overlays, but row 18+ revert to 9-base with cycles, mismatched to expected solid sections or blended 0/6/9; overall, too many forced 4's/mappings where test has no 1's, and positions like pos 20-23 have erratic 0/3/4/6 vs likely clean cycle [4,3,6,9's]; does not account for section breaks (e.g., row 13-17 as 0-block needing different handling), making it look like over-rotated junk rather than patterned output.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where small "blobs" or non-zero patterns in the leftmost columns (0-5) of an input grid influence modifications to a base canvas extracted from the right side (columns 6+), such as color propagation, hole filling, and patterned interleaving or replacement in affected rows, ultimately producing a stylized or rule-based output grid of the same dimensions. The goal is to infer and apply consistent rules from training examples to correctly transform unseen test inputs, focusing on preserving large components while adapting small ones based on left-side cues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Affected rows are those with non-zero values in columns 0-4 (or possibly 0-5), indicating "small blobs" that trigger changes only in those rows, while unaffected rows remain mostly as in the base canvas.
 * Base canvas is typically the right 24 columns (starting from column 6), preserving large connected components (e.g., long horizontal runs of the same number) unless modified by left-side influences.
 * Propagation of colors from left blobs: Small left patterns (e.g., 1-2 cells) often replicate or extend into the left edge of the canvas in affected rows, but not always as simple fills—may involve matching shapes or alternating with dominant canvas colors.
 * Hole filling in large components: Zeros (0s) in affected rows' large blobs should be filled with the row's dominant color, but only within connected large structures; over-filling entire rows or ignoring connectivity leads to mismatches.
 * Y-range transformations: Changes vary by row position or groups (e.g., interleaving patterns like every 3rd cell with a secondary color such as 4,7, or 8), but must respect specific sequences seen in expectations (e.g., repeating triplets like 4-4-7 or 3-8-3); simple modulo-3 interleaving often distorts lengths or positions.
 * Subtle elements: Left blobs can indicate specific patterns (e.g., a single non-zero might trigger minimal changes, while pairs like 6-6 suggest extensions); large canvas components (e.g., runs of 8s or 9s) should not be fully overwritten unless explicitly cued; zeros in expectations are rare and purposeful, not always filled; row groups (e.g., upper vs. lower halves) may have thematic colors (5s top, 4s bottom); connectivity matters—treat horizontal runs as objects, but vertical alignment across rows can influence propagation.
 * Easy-to-miss: Dominant color calculation should consider only non-zero cells in the canvas row, not including left blobs initially; secondary colors for interleaving should be chosen from present canvas colors (prioritizing 4>7>8), not hardcoded; transformations must maintain exact 24-column width without truncation or padding errors; some rows in expectations show asymmetric patterns (e.g., longer runs on one side), suggesting non-uniform application.
 * All considerations: Avoid global changes—modifications are row-specific and only for affected rows; test for blob sizes (small: 1-3 cells, medium: 4-6, large: 7+ in row); potential for shape mirroring (e.g., left blob [1,1] mirrors to canvas edge); handle cases where left has no blobs (copy base unchanged); zeros might represent transparency or errors to preserve in some contexts.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt structured the program modularly with functions for base extraction, affected row detection, color propagation, hole filling, and y-range transformations, which is helpful for debugging but overall incorrect as all training examples failed.
 * What worked: Correctly identified affected rows based on left non-zeros (e.g., in training 1, rows with 7s or 5s on left were targeted); base canvas extraction preserved right-side structure initially; dominant color calculation for filling was conceptually sound but over-applied (e.g., filled entire rows instead of holes only).
 * What didn't work: Propagation was too simplistic (replicated first left color to first 3 canvas positions, but expectations show more nuanced extensions like matching blob size or interleaving with canvas colors, e.g., training 1 row 1 expected all 5s extended but generated mixed 7-3); hole filling ignored connectivity, filling all 0s row-wide (e.g., training 1 row 3 generated 8s where expected has specific 4-7-8 patterns); y-range transformations used flawed modulo-3 interleaving that skipped indices incorrectly, leading to length mismatches and wrong secondary colors (e.g., forced 4/7/8 without checking presence, distorting patterns like expected 3-4-4-7 in training 1); no blob size classification, treating all left non-zeros uniformly.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated heavy 7-3 repetition in upper rows (e.g., row 1: [7,7,3,7,7,...] vs expected [5,5,5,5,3,...] with 5-extension); lower rows filled 8s/1s incorrectly (e.g., row 9: extra 1s at end vs expected mixed 4-7-8 without trailing 1); interleaving created uneven triplets, e.g., row 3 generated [7,7,3,7,7,7,...] but expected [5,5,5,3,3,3,3,...] with no 7s.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Upper rows incorrectly propagated 1/2 to canvas left without pattern matching (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,8,8,9,...] vs expected [2,2,1,8,8,9,...] showing left blob [2,2,1?] influencing specific positions); repeated 4s/8s/9s in middle but ignored expected 1-2-1 triplets (e.g., row 2 generated uniform 8-9 but expected [1,2,1,8,8,9,...]); lower rows over-filled 6s into 9-patterns without alternation.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Top rows incorrectly introduced 3s/8s where expected solid 5s or minimal changes (e.g., row 1: [8,8,5,3,3,...] vs expected [5,5,5,5,5,...] with 3-8 only in specific right positions); bottom 4-rows filled 6s uniformly but expected preserved 4s with inserted 3-8 patterns (e.g., row 6: [4,4,4,2,2,...] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,...3,8,8,...]); no handling for unaffected rows staying solid (e.g., rows 11-14 expected all 5s but generated mixed).
 * Function `propagate_small_colors` is broken (over-replicates to fixed 3 positions, ignores blob shape/size—don't use as-is). 
 * Function `modify_holes_in_large` is partially helpful but overzealous (fills all 0s, not just holes in large blobs—refine with connectivity check). 
 * Function `apply_y_range_transformations` is unhelpful (modulo-3 logic distorts lengths and chooses wrong secondaries—replace with pattern matching from expectations). 
 * Function `identify_affected_rows` and `extract_base_canvas` are correct and essential (keep and build on them). 
 * No object extraction function was used effectively; adding blob extraction (as in helpful tools above) is needed for better propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it relies on the same flawed program that failed all training examples, producing repetitive patterns (e.g., heavy 8-9-6/1/4/7 blocks with sudden 0s in rows 13-16) that don't align with expected subtlety from training (e.g., no nuanced interleaving like 3-8-3 or 4-7-4, instead uniform fills).
 * Upper rows show over-propagation of 6/1 into 8/9/4 backgrounds (e.g., row 0: [8,8,9,6,6,...] likely from left blob influence, but too uniform vs. training's varied extensions); middle rows introduce unexplained 0s (e.g., row 13: [7,7,0,7,7,...] suggesting failed hole filling, but expectations rarely have 0s—should be filled with dominant 7 or 9).
 * Lower rows repeat upper patterns without variation (e.g., rows 17-20 mirror rows 0-3 with 8-9-6, but training shows row-specific y-range differences like upper 5s vs. lower 4s—test lacks this stratification).
 * Overall, test output lacks the patterned insertions (e.g., triplets or alternations) seen in training expectations, instead showing blocky repetitions that ignore blob sizes; it makes sense as an extension of the program's errors but is incorrect because it doesn't mentally match inferred rules (e.g., for test's apparent left 9-6/1 patterns, expect something like 9-extended with 6-6 inserted into 8/4 runs, not full left fills).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing a visual layout like a calendar, diagram, or patterned image) by extracting patterns from a left border area, applying rules for mapping, padding, rotation, and special accents based on global elements like the presence of 8, and then overlaying these patterns onto the main content area while handling headers and empty sections differently. The goal is to normalize and decorate the grid to match expected outputs, possibly simulating visual effects like borders, fills, or accents in a puzzle image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a left border (first 5-6 columns) that encodes patterns for each row, with frame values {0,6,7} to skip, and non-zero values indicating the pattern (e.g., leading frames repeat the first non-frame value).
 * Crop the left 6 columns to focus on the main 24-column content area.
 * Global check for 8 in the entire cropped grid to trigger mappings (e.g., 1 -> 4).
 * For non-empty patterns, pad to exactly 3 elements by repeating the last; for empty left borders (all frames or zeros), use consecutive empty count: rotate previous pattern if 1 empty, [4,4,4] if >1, or empty if none.
 * Headers (rows with empty patterns) need normalization: extend leading 5s to exactly 3 positions, and following 3s to exactly 6 positions.
 * Special accent rule: If pattern is all 4s and grid has 8, change to [4,4,7] only if the row contains 8 (subtle: row-specific check, not global).
 * Overlay the 3-element pattern starting at column 9 (0-indexed in cropped grid), repeating every 6 columns (positions 9-11, 15-17, 21-23).
 * Subtleties: Patterns can be short (1-4 elements), leading zeros/frames create repetitions; consecutive empties propagate rotated or filled patterns; 1s only map to 4s if 8 exists globally, but this interacts with accents; headers might appear mid-grid, not just top; empty patterns don't overlay but normalize; rotations are left-shifts; padding uses last element or 0 if empty.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution), consider that patterns might not always start immediately after frames, and non-pattern values (e.g., 9,2 in ex2) require different handling than assumed (e.g., no universal mapping); empty sections can be long and need consistent filling; overlays don't affect all columns (e.g., 0-8 and 12-14 untouched except in headers).
 * Other considerations: Grids vary in theme (ex1: 3/4/5/7/8 heavy, ex2: 2/8/9 heavy, ex3: 3/5/8 heavy, test: 0/1/3/4/6/9 heavy), so rules must generalize beyond 8-specific logic; test has many 0s and 9s, suggesting borders/frames and fillers that might need ignoring or special empty handling; subtle mismatches in positions (e.g., overlays starting too early/late) break symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt shows partial understanding of left-border pattern extraction and overlay mechanics but fails all training examples due to incorrect handling of non-8 grids (ex2/ex3) and misapplied rules like accents/mappings where 8 isn't dominant.
 * Train 1: Generated extends 5s/3s correctly in header (row0 matches), applies [4,4,7] overlays well in some rows (e.g., row3/4 match accents), but mismatches in row1 (uses [4,4,7] overlay too early, expected plain 3s); row2 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected [4,4,4]); row5 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected all 4s fill); row6 ( [4,4,7] but expected [4,4,7] with 4s in non-overlay); row7 similar but expected more 4s/7s shifted; row8 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected all 8s then 4s); row9-12 (1s not fully mapped or patterned wrong, expected varied 1/4/7/8); row13 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected all 8s then [4,7,4]); row14 (similar, expected all 8s then 4s); row15-20 mismatches in 3/5 extensions and overlays (e.g., row17 expected all 4s fill, got partial overlay).
 * Train 2: Completely mismatches, as it assumes 8-presence mapping but ex2 has no 1s/4s dominance; generated overlays [4,4,7]/[4,4,2] etc. on 9/8 areas, but expected uses left patterns like [2,2,1] directly without mapping, and overlays only in specific blocks (e.g., row0 expected [2,2,1] in positions 0-2/6-8 but got 5/3/9); entire grid generated with wrong base fills (e.g., row1 got [4,4,2] but expected [2,2,2] in left/mid); no recognition of repeating [2,2,1]/[2,2,2]/[1,2,1] cycles from left border.
 * Train 3: Fails to handle 5/8/3 patterns properly; generated all-5 headers and [2,2,2]/[4,4,4] overlays, but expected mixes 3/8 in overlays/headers (e.g., row1 expected [3,8,3] repeating but got [3,3,3]); row2 expected [3,8,8] but got [8,3,8]; row5 expected [3,8,8] overlay on 4s but got all 4s; lower rows (11-15) got plain 5s/4s but expected plain 5s; bottom all-4s match but upper mismatches show poor pattern extraction for 3/8.
 * Function `normalize_header` works for ex1 row0 but overextends in ex3 (applies to non-headers); `get_pattern` skips frames ok but misses repeating non-zeros in ex2 (e.g., treats 2/1 as single); `special_accent` applies [4,4,7] too broadly in ex1 (where not all rows have 8); `map_1_to_4` irrelevant/unhelpful for ex2/ex3 (no 1s, causes wrong 4-fills); overall program composition tracks consecutive empties well but fails when patterns aren't 1/4-based.
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better left-pattern parsing beyond current `get_pattern` (e.g., handle 2/9 as direct patterns without 4-mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies [4,4,4] overlays consistently from row5 onward, but leaves many 0s/9s/6s untouched or partially overlaid (e.g., row0 has [0,0,9] in mid but expected likely normalized 9s or patterned fills based on left 0s indicating empty/header); row1-4 show rotating [1,1,6]/[1,3,6]/[3,6,1]/[4,4,4] but with 9/6/0 remnants, suggesting incomplete overlay (expected full block fills like all-9s with pattern accents, similar to ex2's 8/9 blocks); rows 14-17 all-0 left leads to [4,4,4] but with 0/6 scattered, not a clean fill (expected perhaps all-0 or propagated pattern like ex1 empties); later rows revert to [4,4,4] on 9s but end with mismatched 3/6 (e.g., row22 has 6,4,4,4 but likely expected uniform); overall, too many 0/6/9 persist, no header normalization on top 0-left rows, and no global 8 so 1s stay 1s but overlays ignore left variety (e.g., row10 left implies [4,4,4] ok, but row1's [1,1,6] not rotated properly); doesn't make sense as it looks patchy, not symmetric/blocky like expecteds.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear to interact (e.g., one affecting position, color, size, or structure of another) in **every** train example. I focused only on patterns that hold across all three pairs, ignoring isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific colors like Light Blue appear only in train 2, so excluded). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted; unexplained aspects are noted as unknown. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated large blocks without apparent ties to small elements or frames) are omitted.

1. **Pink holed frame (left border) interacts with adjacent small pixel elements via position**:
   - Consistent in all inputs: Pink (holes=1, bbox starting at [0,0,...], pixels ≈42) forms a left vertical border (x=0-5, y=0-19).
   - Interaction: Always adjacent to small (1-6 pixel, holes=0) elements in Red/Dark Red, Yellow, Green, or Blue at top-left or bottom-left positions (e.g., bbox like [1,1,3,3] or [2,17,2,19]).
   - Effect in all outputs: The Pink frame is consistently removed or transformed into a new left border strip (x=0 to ≈4-5, y=0-19, holes=0, pixels ≈19-75 per segment), with position preserved but color changed (to Orange in train 1 and 3; mixed Red/Maroon in train 2). The adjacent small elements' positions appear to "anchor" this transformation, as output border segments align with input small element y-ranges (top/mid/bottom). Specific color mapping from small elements to border is unknown.

2. **Small pixel elements (1-6 pixels, holes=0) interact with larger regions via replication and position spreading**:
   - Consistent in all inputs: 5-10 small elements (colors: Yellow, Red/Dark Red, Green, Blue, or Maroon; bbox often single points or short lines like [1,5,1,5] or [2,18,3,18]; total pixels <10 per element) clustered near left border (x=1-3, y=1-18).
   - Interaction: These always neighbor the Pink frame and/or initial large blocks (e.g., Green/Maroon/Orange with bbox starting x≥6).
   - Effect in all outputs: Small elements are consistently replicated into 10-20 new single-pixel (pixels=1, holes=0) elements, spread across the full width (x=0-23, y=0-19), often changing color (to Dark Red in train 1; Blue in train 2; Green in train 3). Positions expand rightward from input locations (e.g., input top-left Yellow at y=2-3 becomes output scattered at y=0-7; bottom Dark Red at y=18 becomes output at y=15-19). This spreading affects nearby larger regions by filling gaps or outlining them. Pixel count increase (e.g., input total small pixels ≈20-30 to output ≈30-50) is consistent, but exact replication rule (e.g., based on input pixel count or color) is unknown.

3. **Large holed regions (holes≥1) interact with small pixel elements via hole/structure modification**:
   - Consistent in all inputs: 1-2 large regions (colors: Green, Maroon; holes=1; bbox mid-right like [7,0,29,19] or [10,3,28,17]; pixels >100) with internal "holes" (likely circular/oval motifs from description), positioned right of small elements and Pink frame.
   - Interaction: Always separated from left small elements by a thin buffer (x=6-10), but overlapping in y-range (0-19).
   - Effect in all outputs: Hooled regions are consistently resized/shifted leftward (bbox x-start to 0-4, y-ranges preserved), with hole count modified (e.g., input holes=1 becomes output holes=0 in train 1 and 2; holes=1 in train 3 for Maroon). Small elements' positions correlate with new hole placements or fills (e.g., output single-pixel spreads align with former hole areas, reducing effective holes). This interaction also changes color occasionally (Green input to Yellow output in train 1; preserved in train 3). Specific trigger for hole increase/decrease (e.g., small element count) is unknown, but modification is consistent.

4. **Bottom-left Dark Red small element (2 pixels, holes=0) interacts with overall bottom row via color propagation**:
   - Consistent in all inputs: Dark Red (or Red) vertical pair (pixels=2, bbox like [2,17,2,19] or [2,18,3,18], x=2, y=17-19) at bottom-left, adjacent to Pink frame.
   - Interaction: Always at the bottom edge, near or overlapping y=18-19 of larger regions/frames.
   - Effect in all outputs: Consistently propagates to 3-6 single-pixel elements (color shifts: Dark Red in train 1; Red in train 2; absorbed into Green/Yellow in train 3) along the bottom row (y=17-19, x spread to 10-23). This affects bottom edges of large regions by adding "dots" or outlines, consistent across pairs. Color shift pattern (e.g., to match nearby large region) is unknown.

No other interactions (e.g., direct color-to-color mappings like Yellow -> Green, or position-to-hole count without small elements) were consistent across all three pairs; these often varied or lacked clear ties. Circular motifs (implied by holes) seem to interact only indirectly via the holed regions above. Grid arrangements appear emergent from the spreading in #2 but are not directly tied in every case.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 02:05:11] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where each row has a 5-cell "instruction" or "key" on the left (positions 0-4) that determines a pattern to extract and overlay or modify onto the main 24-cell image area (likely positions 6-29 in a 30-cell row, cropped to 24 elements). The goal is to transform the input grid by applying these per-row patterns, possibly simulating some kind of stamping, filling, or visual completion rule, with patterns carrying over rows under certain conditions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The left 5 cells (row[0:5]) act as a pattern extractor: initial cells matching a "frame" set {0,6,7} are skipped to find a leading non-frame value; if all 5 are frame, no new pattern is extracted and the previous row's pattern is reused.
 * Patterns are built by collecting non-frame, non-zero values after the leading point, then padded to exactly 3 elements (repeating the last if short, or 0 if empty); special case if the original pattern is all 1s, transform it to [4,7,4] and flag for different overlay behavior.
 * Overlay application starts at position 9 in the 24-cell crop (0-based index), repeating the 3-element pattern every 3 positions (step=3) if all_one flag is true, or every 6 positions (step=6) otherwise; only applies up to position 23.
 * Carry-over of patterns across rows when left is all frame (e.g., all 0s or mixtures of 0/6/7) is crucial, but the flag for all_one must also carry over.
 * Grids seem to represent visual elements like shapes, fills, or stamps (e.g., 3s for fills, 4-7 for patterns like borders or waves, 8s for solids, 1s/2s for small details); outputs must preserve unchanged parts of the crop unless overlaid.
 * Subtle: Padding and all_one handling alter the pattern non-trivially (e.g., all 1s becomes [4,7,4], which might represent a specific visual motif like a repeating border); overlays don't affect the first 9 positions of the crop.
 * Row lengths in outputs are fixed at 24, suggesting a consistent cropping from input rows (row[6:30]), ignoring left/right margins.
 * Patterns may represent "objects" or "stamps" that need to be placed at specific offsets, potentially aligning with visual alignments in the expected outputs (e.g., matching columns for shapes).
 * Easy to miss: Non-zero but frame values (like 6/7) in left might indicate boundaries, not patterns; empty patterns lead to no change; overlays can overwrite existing values without blending.
 * Across attempts (this single provided one), considerations include handling variable pattern lengths, row dependencies for carry-over, and position-specific stamping; but ignores potential column-wise interactions or global grid rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    leading = 0
    while leading < 5 and left[leading] in frame:
        leading += 1
    if leading == 5:
        return []
    pattern = []
    first = left[leading]
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Note: This prepends leading repeats of first, but may be incorrect as it doesn't match expectations
    for i in range(leading + 1, 5):
        if left[i] not in frame and left[i] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[i])
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a potential pattern from left, skipping frame; helpful for identifying instructions but buggy in prepending repeats.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads extracted pattern to 3 elements by repeating last or adding 0s; useful for standardizing overlay inputs.)

```python
def is_all_one(p: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(x == 1 for x in p)
```
(Checks for special all-1s case; helpful for triggering pattern transforms like to [4,7,4].)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int], all_one: bool) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    step = 3 if all_one else 6
    for start in range(9, 24, step):
        for k in range(len(p)):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Overlays pattern starting at index 9 in crop, with step based on all_one; core for modification but starts too late/misses alignments in expectations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only provided one) correctly identifies left[0:5] as pattern source and crops to 24 elements, with carry-over logic for empty patterns—worked partially for rows with clear patterns (e.g., in Train 1 rows 7-14, it applies [4,7,4] overlays matching some expected borders).
 * get_pattern prepends leading repeats of first non-frame value, which didn't work (e.g., in Train 1 row 6, leading=2 but prepends two 3s incorrectly, leading to mismatched fills); should likely just start from leading without repeats.
 * Overlay starts at fixed 9 with steps 3/6, which worked for some repeating motifs (e.g., Train 1 rows with 4,7,4) but failed broadly: in Train 1 row 3, generated [4,4,4,8,8,8,...] vs expected [4,4,7,8,8,8,...] (misses 7 insertion, unknown why—possibly wrong step or start pos).
 * All_one handling to [4,7,4] worked in isolated cases (e.g., Train 1 row 7 matches expected [4,7,4] repeats) but over-applied or mis-stepped elsewhere (e.g., Train 1 row 9 generated all [4,7,4] but expected mixes with 8s and 1s).
 * Carry-over helped in sequences of empty lefts (e.g., Train 1 rows 10-14 reuse pattern, partially matching fills) but failed when expectations shift to new motifs (e.g., row 9 expected 8s and 1s, not continued 4,7,4).
 * In Train 2, pattern extraction from lefts like [8,8,8,8,8] (all frame?) led to empty/reuse, generating uniform [4,4,4] overlays that don't match expected small patterns like [2,2,1] or [1,2,1] (misses extracting non-frame details like 1/2).
 * Train 3 generated mostly uniform fills/overlays (e.g., rows 1-2 with [3,3,3] but expected varied [3,8,3]); pad_pattern added repeats incorrectly for short patterns.
 * apply_overlay is helpful for stamping but broken for alignment: starts at 9 (skipping first ~9 cells, which matches some unchanged prefixes) but step=6 misses dense patterns (e.g., Train 2 expects [1,2,1] every few cols, not sparse).
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but incorrect/unhelpful for cases where left has mixed frame/non-frame without clear leading (e.g., ignores potential patterns in frame positions?); don't rely on prepending logic.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of row-wise processing and overlays but misses: variable start positions per row, blending vs overwrite, or extracting patterns from entire left without frame skip; no column-wise or global rules considered.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and seems mostly wrong, as it generates repetitive, uniform overlays (e.g., many rows with [1,3,3] pattern stamped from pos 9 every 6 steps, leading to [...,9,9,9,1,3,3,9,6,0,...]) that don't form coherent visuals; for instance, rows 1-9/18-22 all identical with [1,3,3] despite varying input lefts, suggesting failed pattern extraction/variation.
 * It over-applies carry-over (e.g., rows 3-8/10-13 reuse same [1,3,3] but input lefts differ, e.g., row 2 has potential 4,7,4? Wait, generated row 1 has [4,7,4] briefly but then shifts); expected likely has more varied stamps aligning to visual objects (e.g., filling holes or completing shapes with 0s in cols 7-10/20-23).
 * Rows 13-15 shift to 0-prefix but still stamp [1,3,3], which looks incorrect as it ignores the all-0 left (should carry over but perhaps reset or match expected sparse fills); row 23 has [4,1,3,3] anomaly, possibly from mis-pad.
 * Later rows (26-30) introduce [4,4,4] but with 6s/0s mismatches (e.g., col 19=6 unchanged, but overlays overwrite inconsistently); overall, lacks visual sense—no clear shapes emerge, unlike expectations in trainings (e.g., no matching borders or fills); likely needs dynamic start/step per pattern type to handle test's 0-heavy and 9/6 areas.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 02:05:11] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.


[2025-10-03 02:25:31] Response:
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 02:26:46] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the transformation or extraction of patterns from a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels or shapes in a 2D image), where the goal is to produce a modified output grid that matches specific expected patterns, possibly by cropping, masking, or selectively altering regions based on visual rules like shapes, borders, or object detection. The inputs are large grids (e.g., at least 30 columns wide), and the outputs are 20x24 subgrids or processed versions that reveal hidden images or corrected visuals.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids seem to have consistent widths (around 30+ columns) with potential borders or padding on the left/right; slicing must account for variable widths or non-uniform cropping to avoid distorting inner patterns.
 * Patterns involve repeating numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,7,8,9) that likely represent colors or filled regions; outputs mix these in ways suggesting shape recognition, such as blobs, lines, or symbols (e.g., expected train1 has irregular 4/7 placements forming possible letters or icons, while generated has uniform blocks).
 * Subtle elements include non-uniform changes per row/column (e.g., train1 expected inserts 4/7 in specific positions like row 2 cols 9-12/16-18/22-24, indicating selective replacement or overlay); missing this leads to over-simplification into large uniform blocks.
 * Borders or frames (e.g., 5s on edges in train1/3) must be preserved or adjusted precisely; generated outputs sometimes keep them but fail inner details.
 * Variability across examples: train1 has complex inner mixes (1,3,4,5,7,8), train2 has small inserts (1,2) disrupting 8/9 blocks, train3 has sparse 3/8 overlays on 4/5 bases—rules likely involve detecting and filling "objects" like sparse symbols without affecting backgrounds.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs are always 20 rows by 24 columns; inputs may have extra columns (e.g., slicing 6:30 suggests removing ~6 left columns, but this ignores right-side or vertical adjustments).
 * Consider grid symmetry or repetition (e.g., train2 repeats 20-row patterns in blocks of 4 rows); rules may involve modular or periodic transformations.
 * No global rules like summing or averaging; it's structural (e.g., replace certain regions based on thresholds or patterns).
 * All examples show "background" numbers (e.g., 5/4/8/9) with "foreground" inserts (e.g., 3/1/2/7); puzzle may require identifying and rendering foreground objects correctly.

        self.grid = grid
        self.rows = len(grid)
        self.cols = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
        self.background = self._detect_background()  # e.g., most common number

    """Crop grid by removing columns/rows from edges."""
    cropped_rows = g[top:bottom or len(g)]
    return [row[left:left + 24] if len(row) > left + 24 else row[left:] for row in cropped_rows]

def replace_regions(g: List[List[int]], background: int, regions: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

    output = [row[:] for row in g]

        for r in range(r_start, r_end + 1):
            for c in range(max(0, c_start), min(len(output[r]), c_end + 1)):
                if output[r][c] == background:  # Only replace background
                    output[r][c] = new_val
    return output
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The fixed slicing [row[6:30] for row in g] partially preserved border patterns (e.g., top rows of train1 keep 5/3 sequences matching expected lengths but shift positions incorrectly, leading to uniform 8-blocks where 4/7 should be).
 * Worked for uniform backgrounds (e.g., train3 generated large 5/4 blocks aligning with expected bases, but ignored sparse 3/8 inserts, resulting in no variation).
 * Did not work for inner details: train1 generated has misplaced 1s/8s (e.g., row3 has 8s starting col7 vs expected 4s at col9; row9 has 1s but expected 4s) and misses 4/7 entirely—likely because slicing discards left columns containing pattern cues.
 * Train2 generated uniform 8/9 stripes (repeating every row), but expected inserts small 1/2 clusters (e.g., row0: 2,2,1 at cols0-2 vs generated all 8s)—slicing failed to detect or preserve these sparse objects.
 * Train3 generated solid 5/4 blocks (rows0-4 all 5s, rows5-9 all 4s), but expected mixes 3/8 sparsely (e.g., row1 col15:3 vs 5; row6 col9-14:8s vs 4s)—slicing ignored overlays, treating everything as background.
 * No object detection; attempt assumes static crop, missing dynamic rules like identifying foreground blobs (e.g., 1/2/3/4/7 as objects to reposition or value-swap).
 * Crop width (24 cols) matches output size, but start index 6 is arbitrary and fails when patterns aren't offset consistently (e.g., train2 expects left-edge 1/2s not captured by 6:30).
 * Function is too simplistic; no analysis of grid content—future attempts need pattern detection to handle variations.
 * extract_objects-like function would be essential (as sketched above) to identify mismatches like train1's missing 4/7 shapes, which seem to form non-uniform icons.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be a naive slice (similar to train attempts) producing repetitive 9/0/6 blocks with sporadic 2/4/3/7 inserts (e.g., row2 cols22-23:2,4 vs uniform 0s elsewhere), but lacks cohesion—expected likely needs structured patterns (e.g., symmetric shapes or cleared backgrounds) rather than scattered anomalies.
 * Issues include over-reliance on 9/0 as background without processing (e.g., rows13-16 all 0s suggest empty regions not filled correctly; row23 has 6s at end but test input hints at more integrated 6/7/4 objects).
 * Misses potential rules like merging adjacent same-values (e.g., row10 has 3s clustered but not forming expected blobs) or vertical alignment (e.g., column21 has irregular 0/2/4/0/3/7, probably needs smoothing or replacement).
 * Does not make sense visually: resembles noisy cropped image without puzzle resolution (e.g., no clear shapes emerging from 9/0 sea), unlike expected's deliberate mixes; likely needs object extraction to handle test's unique 0-heavy sparsity and 6/7 accents.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 02:26:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.


[2025-10-03 02:49:08] Response:
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 02:50:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels or segments in a pixel art or ASCII-like image) where the task is to process the input grid to reveal or extract hidden patterns, shapes, or images by removing borders, replacing background/fill values, or applying transformation rules based on number values, resulting in a cleaned or stylized output grid of the same dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids appear to have uniform borders or frames (e.g., repeated 5s on top/bottom, 3s or 8s on sides in train1; 8s and 9s in train2; 5s and 4s in train3), which need to be stripped or modified to reveal inner content, but not via simple uniform cropping as inner patterns vary per row and column.
 * Expected outputs show complex, non-uniform inner structures (e.g., train1 has interspersed 4s, 7s, 8s forming possible shapes like letters or icons; train2 has 1s and 2s creating striped or letter-like patterns amid 8s/9s; train3 mixes 3s and 8s in asymmetric ways suggesting object extraction or overlay).
 * Subtle elements: Numbers like 5, 8, 9 often represent backgrounds or frames that must be preserved in some areas but replaced or removed in others; low numbers (1,2,3,4) seem to form foreground details that aren't uniformly present, requiring detection of "objects" or blobs rather than blind slicing. Grids are consistently 20 rows by 24 columns in outputs, so transformations shouldn't resize but modify in place.
 * Easy-to-miss: Patterns aren't symmetric (e.g., train1 row 2 expected has all 3s at end, but generated has mixed; train2 repeats vertical motifs like [2,2,1] that suggest rule-based replication); test input has irregular intrusions (e.g., 2,4,3,7 scattered in a sea of 9s/0s/6s), implying rules for filling blanks or propagating values.
 * Considerations across attempts: No pattern detection yet—simple slicing ignores value-based logic; must handle varying frame thicknesses (e.g., train1 frames ~5-6 columns of 5/3, but inner varies); potential for conditional replacement (e.g., replace 0s with adjacent values?); outputs must exactly match expected sequences per row, including trailing patterns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions from this attempt, as it only uses basic slicing without analysis.

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```
This is a simple row slice (assuming full rows are 30+ elements long, cropping from column 6 onward to fit 24 elements), but it's broken/not helpful: it blindly extracts a subgrid without value processing, leading to partial border retention but garbled inners (e.g., exposes raw 8s/1s in train1 without forming expected 4/7 patterns). Don't use in future—lacks object detection or rule application.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (slicing columns 6:30) partially worked by removing left borders in all trainings (e.g., train1 generated starts with 5s/3s matching expected top rows partially; train2/3 strip some uniform edges), but failed overall by not modifying inner values, resulting in incorrect patterns everywhere.
 * Train1: Generated retained top 5/3 borders accurately for first 2 rows but mismatched from row 3 onward (e.g., row3 has uniform 3s vs expected 4s/3s mix; row4 introduces unwanted 8s early vs expected 4/7/8; rows 9-13 show 1s/8s blobs not in expected 4/7/1 mixes—difference unknown but likely due to cropping exposing unprocessed raw data).
 * Train2: Generated uniform 8/9 stripes across all rows (no variation), vs expected which has repeating but non-uniform motifs (e.g., row1 expected [2,2,1,8...] vs generated all 8/9; entire grid lacks 1/2 details, making it look like a solid frame instead of patterned text/shapes—slicing didn't detect or insert the 1/2 "accents").
 * Train3: Generated uniform 5s (top/bottom) and 4s (middle), vs expected which has 5/3/8 mixes (e.g., row2 expected [5s then 3,8,3...] vs all 5s; row7 expected 4s with 8s/3s vs all 4s—slicing preserved filler blocks but erased subtle 3/8 intrusions, missing asymmetry).
 * No object extraction attempted, which seems essential for handling scattered low numbers (e.g., 1s in train1/2); slicing alone can't "find" or isolate shapes.
 * Test input isn't directly compared (no expected provided), but generated output shows slicing effects: mostly 9/0/6 with scattered 2/4/3/7 (e.g., row3 has 2,4 intrusions vs uniform 0s elsewhere), which partially strips left 9s but leaves irregular right-side noise—doesn't form coherent shapes like trainings' expecteds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears as a cropped version of a bordered grid with 9s/0s as background, 6s as a right-side frame, and sporadic 2/4/3/7 as unprocessed artifacts (e.g., rows 3-4 have 2/4 swaps, row7 has 3, row10 has 3s block, row24 has 4/6 mix), but lacks the structured patterns of expected trainings (no clear shapes or replacements; looks noisy/random vs stylized). This suggests the slice removed a left border but failed to clean/interpret inners, so it's incomplete—likely needs value-based rules (e.g., flood-fill 0s or detect 6-frame) to match puzzle logic, as raw crop doesn't "reveal" anything meaningful.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 02:50:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images composed of numerical values (likely representing colors, pixels, or pattern elements), where the goal is to transform or extract specific patterns, shapes, or objects from the input grid to produce a modified output grid that matches complex expected arrangements, possibly simulating rendering, cropping, or object manipulation in a stylized or symbolic way (e.g., letters, icons, or layered designs).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are 20x24 (rows x columns), with numbers like 0-9 representing distinct visual elements (e.g., 5 might be background/white, 3/4/8 patterns for shapes, 1/2 for accents or holes); patterns form asymmetric shapes that suggest letters (e.g., train1 expected looks like a stylized "A" or "H" with internal divisions using 4/7/8).
 * Subtle elements include irregular boundaries, internal fills, and overlays (e.g., train1 has nested 4/7/8 within 3/5 borders; train2 has repeating 1/2 motifs in a 8/9 field like a patterned border; train3 has sparse 3/8 intrusions into uniform 5/4 blocks, possibly like dotted lines or accents).
 * Outputs preserve grid dimensions but alter values selectively— not simple uniform fills or crops; must handle asymmetry (e.g., diagonal shifts in train1 row 2-3) and repetitions (e.g., train2's periodic 1/2/8/9 cycles every few rows).
 * Easy to miss: Non-contiguous regions (e.g., isolated 1s in train1 row11-12), vertical/horizontal mirroring or staggering (e.g., train2's 1/2 placements alternate), and background preservation (e.g., train3 keeps large 5/4 areas but inserts 3/8 precisely).
 * Considerations across attempts: No object extraction yet, but patterns imply identifying blobs/regions (e.g., connected components of same number); cropping ignores left-side context which may contain keys or mirrors (e.g., train1 generated misses left 5/3 buildup); uniform outputs (like train3 generated) fail to capture sparse changes; test input has dense 9/0 with sparse 2/3/4/6/7, suggesting need for pattern recognition beyond slicing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

# Basic grid utility (potentially helpful for future, but not used effectively here)
def get_grid_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    """Returns (rows, cols) of the grid."""
    return len(g), len(g[0]) if g else (0, 0)
```

```python
# Potential for object extraction (not implemented in attempt, but essential based on patterns; could identify connected regions)
def find_connected_regions(g: List[List[int]], start_val: int, directions: List[tuple] = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]) -> List[List[tuple[int,int]]]:
    """Extracts connected components (blobs) of a given value; returns list of region coordinates. Unimplemented in attempt but key for shape detection."""
    visited = [[False for _ in row] for row in g]
    regions = []
    for i in range(len(g)):
        for j in range(len(g[0])):
            if g[i][j] == start_val and not visited[i][j]:
                region = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if 0 <= x < len(g) and 0 <= y < len(g[0]) and g[x][y] == start_val and not visited[x][y]:
                        visited[x][y] = True
                        region.append((x, y))
                        for dx, dy in directions:
                            stack.append((x + dx, y + dy))
                regions.append(region)
    return regions
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Attempt used simple cropping (remove left 6 columns) assuming main content is right-shifted, but this failed all training examples by producing sliced inputs without transformation (e.g., retained raw patterns like 5/3/8/1 in train1 but ignored expected 4/7 insertions).
 * What worked: Preserved relative row lengths and some right-side details (e.g., train1 generated correctly shows 8-heavy lower sections), but this is coincidental and not rule-based.
 * What didn't work: Completely mismatched expected outputs—train1 generated has uniform 3/8 bands without 4/7 accents (e.g., row3 generated [5,5,5,3,...] vs expected [5,5,5,3,...,4,4,4,...] with internal 4s); train2 generated uniform 8/9 stripes ignoring 1/2 motifs (e.g., all rows identical 8/9 blocks vs expected alternating 1/2 insertions every 3 rows); train3 generated solid 5/4 blocks missing sparse 3/8 (e.g., row1 all 5s vs expected mixed 5/8 at end); no understanding of pattern rules, just mechanical slice.
 * Cropping function `crop_right_part` is broken/not helpful (arbitrary 6-column cut; left side likely contains setup/context, e.g., train1 input implied to have more left structure); don't use in future without validation.
 * No object extraction attempted, but needed—patterns suggest manipulating detected shapes (e.g., filling holes with 1s in train1, or overlaying 3/8 in train3).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes (e.g., expected has irregular 4/7/8 clusters, generated keeps input 8/1 without change; unknown why, possibly no region detection).
 * Train2 omits periodic accents (1/2 as "dots" in 8/9 field; generated uniform, missing cycle).
 * Train3 ignores intrusions (3/8 as sparse overlays; generated solid, no subtlety in placement).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a naive crop (removing ~left 6-8 columns variably, retaining raw 9/0/6 with minor 2/3/4/7), producing repetitive 9/0 bands and isolated changes (e.g., row2-3 has 2/4 swaps, row10 has 3s) without transformation, which mismatches puzzle's need for pattern synthesis (e.g., expected likely reorganizes sparse elements like 2/3/4/6/7 into structured motifs within 9/0/6 background, similar to train3's 3/8 dots; current output looks like unprocessed input slice, missing any shape detection or overlay rules).
 * Test has vertical repetitions (e.g., rows 0-5 identical 9/0/6), horizontal sparsity (e.g., 2/4 only in cols 22-23 rows 2-3), and bottom variations (e.g., row23 has 4/6), suggesting rules for propagating or mirroring these (e.g., fill regions or alternate like train2), but generated ignores this for raw dump.
 * To handle test, account for background dominance (9/0 as fill) and accent propagation (e.g., extend 6s or insert based on neighbors); current output fails as it doesn't demonstrate puzzle understanding.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where numbers represent colors, patterns, or elements in a bordered frame, and the task is to process the input grid to output a cleaned or transformed version of the interior puzzle content, preserving the overall structure but correctly interpreting or extracting the main visual elements while removing framing artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * All inputs appear to have a consistent left border (first 6 columns) consisting of frame elements like 6's or other consistent values that frame the puzzle, which must be cropped to access the 24-column interior; however, simply cropping without further processing leaves the interior numbers unchanged, which does not match expectations.
 * Interiors contain patterns of numbers (e.g., 3's, 8's, 4's, 7's, 1's, 9's, 0's) that likely represent shapes, objects, or encoded visuals; expected outputs show transformations or replacements in these areas (e.g., blocks of 8's become mixed 4's/7's in train 1, uniform 9's become patterned 1's/2's in train 2), suggesting rules for decoding, filling, or recognizing connected components/blobs rather than literal copying.
 * Top and bottom rows often retain border-like values (e.g., 5's in train 1 and 3), indicating that horizontal borders may be part of the output or need selective preservation, while vertical frames (left/right) are fully removed; right borders (e.g., 6's in test) may also need cropping or handling.
 * Subtle patterns include non-uniform interiors: train 1 has irregular shapes with 1's and 8's that become more complex with 4's/7's; train 2 has repeating horizontal bands that resolve into vertical motifs with 1's/2's interrupting 9's; train 3 has solid blocks (5's and 4's) that embed finer 3/8 patterns, implying hierarchical structure or overlay rules.
 * Grids are consistently 20 rows by 24 columns post-crop, but inputs are likely 30 columns wide; no rotation, scaling, or dimension changes are needed, but connected regions (e.g., blobs of same numbers) may need extraction or replacement based on size, shape, or position.
 * Easy-to-miss: Uniform generated outputs (e.g., all 8's/9's in bands) ignore subtle interruptions or encodings in the original (e.g., 1's/2's as separators or holes); right-side elements like 6's in test may be frame remnants needing removal; 0's in test could be empty space or background, but without transformation, they persist incorrectly.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, focused solely on left cropping; future attempts must address interior decoding (e.g., pattern recognition for shapes like letters/symbols); handle variable border thicknesses if present; ensure output matches exact expected values, not just dimensions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def crop_left_border(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Crops the left 6 columns (frame) from each row, assuming 30-column input, to yield 24-column interior.
    This is a necessary first step as it correctly removes the consistent left frame in all examples,
    but must be combined with interior processing for full correctness.
    """
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```

No other functions from the attempt; no extraction tools for blobs/objects were provided, but they would be essential for identifying and transforming patterns (e.g., connected components of numbers like 8's into decoded shapes).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly identifies and removes the left border (6 columns of frame), which aligns with the positioning of main content in all training examples and produces the right dimensions (24 columns), but fails entirely on interior content by copying values verbatim without transformation.
 * Train 1: Generated a simple diagonal/rectangular shape of 3's filled with 8's and isolated 1's, but expected a more intricate pattern with 4's/7's replacing many 8's, 1's repositioned or expanded, and additional 4's/7's in non-8 areas (e.g., row 2 expected has 4's/3's mix where generated has all 3's; unknown why 8's map to 4/7 but likely shape decoding).
 * Train 2: Generated uniform horizontal bands of 8's interrupted only by 9's, but expected inserts 1's/2's in specific positions (e.g., row 0 expected starts [2,2,1,...] where generated has all 8's/9's; this misses patterned motifs like checkerboard or symbols in the 8/9 areas).
 * Train 3: Generated solid horizontal blocks of 5's (top/bottom) and 4's (middle), but expected embeds 3/8 patterns within those blocks (e.g., row 1 expected has 3/8 interruptions in 5's where generated is uniform 5's; row 6 expected mixes 3/8 in 4's area).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt, but naive cropping alone is insufficient and broken for the full problem (do not use without adding pattern recognition or mapping rules).
 * Extracting objects/blobs (not implemented) seems essential for future attempts to handle shape-based transformations, as generated outputs ignore connected regions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it merely crops the left 6 columns, resulting in a grid of 9's (likely background/frame), 0's (empty or interior space), 6's (right frame remnants), and scattered 2/3/4/7's, but based on training examples, this unchanged interior likely needs transformation (e.g., 9/0/6 patterns should decode into mixed numbers like 1/2/3/4/7/8 as in trains; scattered digits like 2/4 in row 2 may be part of shapes that get filled or replaced).
 * It preserves right-side 6's (e.g., column 19 in many rows), which may be a right border needing cropping (e.g., to 24 columns total, but test shows 24 values with 6's at end, suggesting incomplete frame removal); uniform 9's and 0's bands resemble train 2/3 generated failures, missing subtle embeddings (e.g., row 10 has 3's that might expand into patterns).
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exactly, but it does not make sense as a final puzzle solution since training shows interiors must be actively processed, not copied; account for potential right-cropping (e.g., remove last 0-6 columns if 6's are frame) and blob detection to handle isolated 0/3/7 as object starts.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of input grids (2D lists of integers representing colored pixels, likely 0=background, 1-9=colors) into output grids that follow specific spatial and structural rules derived from patterns in the examples. The transformations preserve certain elements like large colored blocks, small clusters, and holes while removing frames, redistributing pixels, and adjusting positions/sizes to fit a standard 20x24 canvas, often reducing complexity or pixel density.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Inputs appear to have a left-side "pink frame" (possibly color 6 or background with holes=1 property) spanning ~6 columns that must be removed by shifting the main content left, but without losing overlap or cluster details—subtlety: the frame might not always be uniform, and ignoring it can cause misalignment in subsequent steps.
 * Top-left small pixel clusters (1-5 pixels, colors like 3,4,5) need to be extracted, their colors inferred, and redistributed into sparse 1-3 pixel patterns across the top rows or canvas edges, approximating original pixel count but not exactly—easy to miss: redistribution should avoid overwriting large blocks and preserve color variety, not just cycle through one color.
 * Large colored blocks (e.g., solid regions of 4,5,8,9) must be repositioned leftward (slicing and expanding to fill ~x=0-23), split/combined if needed, and reduced in pixel count by 10-20% through overlaps or trimming, while maintaining color and hole properties (holes=0 or increased via filling)—subtlety: expansion shouldn't fill gaps with arbitrary colors (e.g., propagating previous color blindly); instead, resolve overlaps by priority (e.g., foreground over background) and ensure no uniform filling with a single color like 3.
 * Bottom small dark red elements (color 7, often 2-4 pixels in pairs) from input bottom rows should be placed/shifted rightward into the output's bottom 1-2 rows, typically 2-4 instances—key: count and position based on input occurrences, but avoid overplacing or ignoring row overlaps.
 * Shapes with holes (especially large ones with holes=1) need modification: map to outputs with holes=0 or more, propagate/fill using nearby cluster colors, and reduce pixel count by 20-50% via overwriting or trimming—subtlety: filling shouldn't use arbitrary colors (e.g., hard-coded 3); instead, use context from input (e.g., green=3 or 5), and avoid global overwrites that turn everything uniform.
 * Overall canvas is consistently 20 rows x 24 columns; background is often 3 (light green?) or 0, but outputs mix backgrounds strategically—easy to miss: preserve asymmetry and patterns (e.g., interspersed 1's,2's for holes or dividers); pixel reduction is approximate, not exact; rules interact (e.g., redistribution after frame removal, before block repositioning).
 * Common pitfalls: Over-filling with background color 3 (seen in all attempts, creating solid top rows); introducing 0's in test output (likely invalid, as expected outputs avoid raw 0's); ignoring hole propagation (e.g., 1's in expected as hole markers); not handling variable block sizes/splits (e.g., expected has dotted patterns like 4-7-4, not solid blocks).
 * Considerations across attempts: Rules must be applied sequentially but with input references preserved (e.g., don't modify g in place); count pixels/holes accurately (e.g., sum non-0/6 in regions); handle no-cluster cases gracefully; subtle color mappings (e.g., 7= dark red, 6=pink/frame, 8/9=large blocks, 4/5=medium shapes).

* Note: extract_large_blocks is a helpful skeleton but needs full flood-fill implementation for accuracy (current program lacks this, leading to blind slicing).
* count_bottom_elements is useful and partially correct in the original place_bottom_dark_red, but ignores rightward shift logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, producing grids with excessive uniform 3's in top 4 rows (generated solid [3]*24, expected has patterned 5's,3's,4's,2's,1's), indicating broken remove_pink_frame or initial out creation—likely assumes wrong width (out_w = w-6) without padding to 24 cols.
 * redistribute_top_left_cluster worked partially in extracting colors but failed in placement: cycles colors into fixed starts [0,6,12,18] creating repetitive 1-3 pixel groups, but overwrites large areas incorrectly (e.g., Train1 generated scattered 3's/5's/4's in top, expected has structured top-left 5's block); num_pix logic is arbitrary and doesn't approximate count.
 * reposition_large_blocks is broken: simulates expansion by propagating colors left-to-right (filling 0's with prev), but introduces uniform fills (e.g., Train1 has solid 3's propagating, expected has irregular 8's/4's with 7's holes); pixel loss via arbitrary 10% overwrite to neighbor is unhelpful and creates artifacts (e.g., Train2 solid 8/9 blocks without 1/2 dividers); doesn't actually split/combine or handle overlaps properly.
 * place_bottom_dark_red partially works: counts bottom 7's correctly but places too many (min(4,max(2,count))) in fixed right position (start_j=24-num_place), duplicating in two rows—Train1 placed [7,7] at end but expected has scattered 7's integrated into patterns; Train3 placed [7,7] but expected has no bottom 7's, showing over-placement when input lacks them.
 * modify_shape_holes is unhelpful/broken: hard-codes fill to 3 (green), overwrites ~20% non-zero globally without hole detection, leading to uniform reduction (e.g., Train1 overwrote to 3's everywhere, expected preserves detailed 1's/7's; Train2/3 similar uniform 4's/5's); ignores input holes=1 mapping, causing loss of structure (e.g., expected holes via 1's or gaps not filled arbitrarily).
 * Overall: Program assumes fixed 6-col frame removal without verification (works if present, but test has no clear frame); sequential application loses input context (e.g., g not passed consistently); no object extraction, so rules are blind operations—essential for handling variable inputs; Train1 mismatches blob shapes (e.g., expected complex 4-7-8 weave, generated solid 8's with wrong 1's); Train2 misses small 1/2 patterns (generated solid 8/9, expected dotted 2-1-2 dividers); Train3 ignores top 5's patterning (generated solid 5's row, expected interspersed 3/8 holes); subtle: all generated have trailing 3's on right, expected fills canvas fully without them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Top 6 rows are solid 3's (likely from unhandled empty space post-frame removal or bad init), while expected should start with patterned large blocks (e.g., similar to Train3's top 5's with 8's holes)—this uniform fill ignores any top clusters. Middle has solid 9's blocks (rows 6-12,18-31? but grid is 20x24, output shows 32 rows? likely formatting error, but assumes solid expansion without splits/holes). Rows 13-16 have 0's (raw background, invalid as expected avoids 0's, using 3 instead), breaking continuity. Bottom has 6's blocks with stray 4's and 7's (e.g., row 30 has 6,6,4,4,6,6; rows 31-32 have 7's), but placement seems arbitrary—not right-shifted bottom 7's, and 6's (pink?) shouldn't persist post-frame removal. Overall, lacks reduction (solid blocks > expected sparse), no hole filling (0's unfilled), and doesn't match expected style of integrated patterns (e.g., 9's with 6/7/4 interspersions); test input has vertical 9's tower left, horizontal 6's right/mid, bottom 0's and 7's—output should shift 9's left, redistribute any top clusters into top, fill 0's with 3 or clusters, place 2-4 7's bottom-right, reduce 9/6 density by 20%.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the transformation or extraction of patterns from a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels or shapes in a 2D image), where the goal is to produce a modified output grid that matches specific expected patterns, possibly by cropping, masking, or selectively altering regions based on visual rules like shapes, borders, or object detection. The inputs are large grids (e.g., at least 30 columns wide), and the outputs are 20x24 subgrids or processed versions that reveal hidden images or corrected visuals.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids seem to have consistent widths (around 30+ columns) with potential borders or padding on the left/right; slicing must account for variable widths or non-uniform cropping to avoid distorting inner patterns.
 * Patterns involve repeating numbers (e.g., 3,4,5,7,8,9) that likely represent colors or filled regions; outputs mix these in ways suggesting shape recognition, such as blobs, lines, or symbols (e.g., expected train1 has irregular 4/7 placements forming possible letters or icons, while generated has uniform blocks).
 * Subtle elements include non-uniform changes per row/column (e.g., train1 expected inserts 4/7 in specific positions like row 2 cols 9-12/16-18/22-24, indicating selective replacement or overlay); missing this leads to over-simplification into large uniform blocks.
 * Borders or frames (e.g., 5s on edges in train1/3) must be preserved or adjusted precisely; generated outputs sometimes keep them but fail inner details.
 * Variability across examples: train1 has complex inner mixes (1,3,4,5,7,8), train2 has small inserts (1,2) disrupting 8/9 blocks, train3 has sparse 3/8 overlays on 4/5 bases—rules likely involve detecting and filling "objects" like sparse symbols without affecting backgrounds.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs are always 20 rows by 24 columns; inputs may have extra columns (e.g., slicing 6:30 suggests removing ~6 left columns, but this ignores right-side or vertical adjustments).
 * Consider grid symmetry or repetition (e.g., train2 repeats 20-row patterns in blocks of 4 rows); rules may involve modular or periodic transformations.
 * No global rules like summing or averaging; it's structural (e.g., replace certain regions based on thresholds or patterns).
 * All examples show "background" numbers (e.g., 5/4/8/9) with "foreground" inserts (e.g., 3/1/2/7); puzzle may require identifying and rendering foreground objects correctly.

    return output
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The fixed slicing [row[6:30] for row in g] partially preserved border patterns (e.g., top rows of train1 keep 5/3 sequences matching expected lengths but shift positions incorrectly, leading to uniform 8-blocks where 4/7 should be).
 * Worked for uniform backgrounds (e.g., train3 generated large 5/4 blocks aligning with expected bases, but ignored sparse 3/8 inserts, resulting in no variation).
 * Did not work for inner details: train1 generated has misplaced 1s/8s (e.g., row3 has 8s starting col7 vs expected 4s at col9; row9 has 1s but expected 4s) and misses 4/7 entirely—likely because slicing discards left columns containing pattern cues.
 * Train2 generated uniform 8/9 stripes (repeating every row), but expected inserts small 1/2 clusters (e.g., row0: 2,2,1 at cols0-2 vs generated all 8s)—slicing failed to detect or preserve these sparse objects.
 * Train3 generated solid 5/4 blocks (rows0-4 all 5s, rows5-9 all 4s), but expected mixes 3/8 sparsely (e.g., row1 col15:3 vs 5; row6 col9-14:8s vs 4s)—slicing ignored overlays, treating everything as background.
 * No object detection; attempt assumes static crop, missing dynamic rules like identifying foreground blobs (e.g., 1/2/3/4/7 as objects to reposition or value-swap).
 * Crop width (24 cols) matches output size, but start index 6 is arbitrary and fails when patterns aren't offset consistently (e.g., train2 expects left-edge 1/2s not captured by 6:30).
 * Function is too simplistic; no analysis of grid content—future attempts need pattern detection to handle variations.
 * extract_objects-like function would be essential (as sketched above) to identify mismatches like train1's missing 4/7 shapes, which seem to form non-uniform icons.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be a naive slice (similar to train attempts) producing repetitive 9/0/6 blocks with sporadic 2/4/3/7 inserts (e.g., row2 cols22-23:2,4 vs uniform 0s elsewhere), but lacks cohesion—expected likely needs structured patterns (e.g., symmetric shapes or cleared backgrounds) rather than scattered anomalies.
 * Issues include over-reliance on 9/0 as background without processing (e.g., rows13-16 all 0s suggest empty regions not filled correctly; row23 has 6s at end but test input hints at more integrated 6/7/4 objects).
 * Misses potential rules like merging adjacent same-values (e.g., row10 has 3s clustered but not forming expected blobs) or vertical alignment (e.g., column21 has irregular 0/2/4/0/3/7, probably needs smoothing or replacement).
 * Does not make sense visually: resembles noisy cropped image without puzzle resolution (e.g., no clear shapes emerging from 9/0 sea), unlike expected's deliberate mixes; likely needs object extraction to handle test's unique 0-heavy sparsity and 6/7 accents.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colored pixels or segments in a pixel art or ASCII-like image) where the task is to process the input grid to reveal or extract hidden patterns, shapes, or images by removing borders, replacing background/fill values, or applying transformation rules based on number values, resulting in a cleaned or stylized output grid of the same dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids appear to have uniform borders or frames (e.g., repeated 5s on top/bottom, 3s or 8s on sides in train1; 8s and 9s in train2; 5s and 4s in train3), which need to be stripped or modified to reveal inner content, but not via simple uniform cropping as inner patterns vary per row and column.
 * Expected outputs show complex, non-uniform inner structures (e.g., train1 has interspersed 4s, 7s, 8s forming possible shapes like letters or icons; train2 has 1s and 2s creating striped or letter-like patterns amid 8s/9s; train3 mixes 3s and 8s in asymmetric ways suggesting object extraction or overlay).
 * Subtle elements: Numbers like 5, 8, 9 often represent backgrounds or frames that must be preserved in some areas but replaced or removed in others; low numbers (1,2,3,4) seem to form foreground details that aren't uniformly present, requiring detection of "objects" or blobs rather than blind slicing. Grids are consistently 20 rows by 24 columns in outputs, so transformations shouldn't resize but modify in place.
 * Easy-to-miss: Patterns aren't symmetric (e.g., train1 row 2 expected has all 3s at end, but generated has mixed; train2 repeats vertical motifs like [2,2,1] that suggest rule-based replication); test input has irregular intrusions (e.g., 2,4,3,7 scattered in a sea of 9s/0s/6s), implying rules for filling blanks or propagating values.
 * Considerations across attempts: No pattern detection yet—simple slicing ignores value-based logic; must handle varying frame thicknesses (e.g., train1 frames ~5-6 columns of 5/3, but inner varies); potential for conditional replacement (e.g., replace 0s with adjacent values?); outputs must exactly match expected sequences per row, including trailing patterns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions from this attempt, as it only uses basic slicing without analysis.

**Unhelpful/broken functions:**
```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[6:30] for row in g]
```
This is a simple row slice (assuming full rows are 30+ elements long, cropping from column 6 onward to fit 24 elements), but it's broken/not helpful: it blindly extracts a subgrid without value processing, leading to partial border retention but garbled inners (e.g., exposes raw 8s/1s in train1 without forming expected 4/7 patterns). Don't use in future—lacks object detection or rule application.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (slicing columns 6:30) partially worked by removing left borders in all trainings (e.g., train1 generated starts with 5s/3s matching expected top rows partially; train2/3 strip some uniform edges), but failed overall by not modifying inner values, resulting in incorrect patterns everywhere.
 * Train1: Generated retained top 5/3 borders accurately for first 2 rows but mismatched from row 3 onward (e.g., row3 has uniform 3s vs expected 4s/3s mix; row4 introduces unwanted 8s early vs expected 4/7/8; rows 9-13 show 1s/8s blobs not in expected 4/7/1 mixes—difference unknown but likely due to cropping exposing unprocessed raw data).
 * Train2: Generated uniform 8/9 stripes across all rows (no variation), vs expected which has repeating but non-uniform motifs (e.g., row1 expected [2,2,1,8...] vs generated all 8/9; entire grid lacks 1/2 details, making it look like a solid frame instead of patterned text/shapes—slicing didn't detect or insert the 1/2 "accents").
 * Train3: Generated uniform 5s (top/bottom) and 4s (middle), vs expected which has 5/3/8 mixes (e.g., row2 expected [5s then 3,8,3...] vs all 5s; row7 expected 4s with 8s/3s vs all 4s—slicing preserved filler blocks but erased subtle 3/8 intrusions, missing asymmetry).
 * No object extraction attempted, which seems essential for handling scattered low numbers (e.g., 1s in train1/2); slicing alone can't "find" or isolate shapes.
 * Test input isn't directly compared (no expected provided), but generated output shows slicing effects: mostly 9/0/6 with scattered 2/4/3/7 (e.g., row3 has 2,4 intrusions vs uniform 0s elsewhere), which partially strips left 9s but leaves irregular right-side noise—doesn't form coherent shapes like trainings' expecteds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears as a cropped version of a bordered grid with 9s/0s as background, 6s as a right-side frame, and sporadic 2/4/3/7 as unprocessed artifacts (e.g., rows 3-4 have 2/4 swaps, row7 has 3, row10 has 3s block, row24 has 4/6 mix), but lacks the structured patterns of expected trainings (no clear shapes or replacements; looks noisy/random vs stylized). This suggests the slice removed a left border but failed to clean/interpret inners, so it's incomplete—likely needs value-based rules (e.g., flood-fill 0s or detect 6-frame) to match puzzle logic, as raw crop doesn't "reveal" anything meaningful.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers representing colors or symbols, where the left portion of each row (likely columns 0-5) encodes a pattern or rule that must be extracted and applied as an overlay or transformation to the cropped main content area (likely columns 6-29, producing 24 elements per row). The goal is to generate a modified output grid that matches expected transformations, involving header normalizations, pattern cycling for empty rows, and periodic overlays, but the current approach misapplies these rules leading to mismatches in pattern propagation, header extensions, and overlay positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 columns, ignoring or framing with specific values like 0,6,7; leading frames determine repetition, and non-zero values after form the core pattern, but this fails when patterns shift or cycle incorrectly across consecutive empty rows.
 * Header normalization extends initial runs of 5's to exactly 3 cells and 3's to 6 cells by overwriting subsequent cells, but this is applied universally without checking row context, leading to over-extension or incorrect starts (e.g., turning partial 5's into full 3's prematurely).
 * Overlays apply a 3-element pattern (padded/repeated if short, with 1's mapped to 4's) starting at index 9 of the crop, repeating every 6 positions for the first 3 slots of each block, but this ignores varying block structures, deeper pattern rotations (e.g., [1:] + [0] for cycles), and doesn't handle cases where patterns evolve mid-grid or interact with existing content like 8's or 9's.
 * Consecutive empty patterns (no non-frame values in left) carry the previous pattern but cycle it (e.g., rotate left by 1), resetting counter on new patterns; however, the cycle logic only triggers after >1 empty, which misses single-empty carries and fails on long sequences.
 * Crop is always row[6:30] (24 elements), assuming fixed width; outputs must preserve this length without introducing 0's unless they are part of the expected transformation.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may need to be derived from cumulative or row-spanning logic (e.g., vertical alignment across rows), 1's specifically map to 4's in overlays but not elsewhere, and certain values like 8's or 9's act as backgrounds that overlays replace selectively; empty lefts don't always cycle but may default to all-5 or all-3 headers.
 * Across examples, expected outputs show progressive shifts (e.g., 5's shrinking, 3's expanding, overlays inserting 4/7/8 blocks), suggesting rules tied to row index or global progression, not just per-row left extraction.
 * Avoid universal normalization—some rows in expected have irregular headers (e.g., single 5's or mixed 3/8 without extension); overlays may start earlier/later or apply to different strides based on pattern length.
 * 0's in left indicate frames/empties but should not propagate to output crops unless expected; test inputs have 0's in crops, which generated outputs retain incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Extract pattern from left 5 columns based on leading frame colors (0,6,7)."""
    frame = {0, 6, 7}

    i = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []  # Empty pattern
    first = left[i]
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame

        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function partially works for identifying leading repeats but fails on complex lefts with mixed non-frames; useful as a starting point for extraction but needs refinement for cycling.)

    """Extend initial runs of 5 and 3 to 3 and 6 respectively by overwriting next cells."""
    crop = crop[:]  # Copy
    # Extend 5's to 3
    num5 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 5
    # Re-find and extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(crop) and crop[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    num3 = 0
    i = start3
    while i < len(crop) and crop[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1

            if i + j < len(crop):
                crop[i + j] = 3
    return crop
```
(This is broken for rows without initial 5/3 runs, as it forces extensions where expected outputs have different starts like 8's or 4's; not helpful without conditional application based on left pattern.)

```python
def apply_overlay(crop: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Apply pattern overlay starting from position 9, every 6 positions, replacing first 3."""
    p = pattern[:]
    while len(p) < 3 and p:
        p.append(p[-1])
    p = p[:3]
    result = crop[:]
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Map 1's to 4's
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(3):
            if start + k < 24:
                result[start + k] = p[k]
    return result
```
(This overlays too rigidly at fixed starts/stride, ignoring expected variations like shifting to positions 0-8 or different repeats; unhelpful for dynamic patterns, e.g., rotating 7/8 blocks.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies the crop as row[6:30] and handles basic pattern extraction from left, with consecutive empty logic attempting carry-over, but fails overall as all training examples are incorrect.
 * For Training 1: Rows 0-1 match expected headers exactly ([5x5 + 3x22 +5x2] and [5x4 +3x20]), but row 2 mismatches from pos 9-11 (generated 4,4,4 vs expected 3,3,3) and pos 18-20 (3,3,3 vs 4,4,4), showing overlay wrongly inserts 4's where 3's should persist; row 4 mismatches pos 10 (7 vs nothing, expected has 4,7,4 but generated shifts); row 5 major mismatch (generated 4,7,4,8x3 vs expected 5,5,3x5,8x2 + all 4's), indicating failed header shrink and wrong overlay cycle; later rows like 8-12 insert 1's/4's incorrectly where expected has 8's/3's evolving vertically; row 17 has 6's where expected has 3's/8's, suggesting pattern misderivation from left.
 * For Training 2: Almost no matches—row 0 generated [5x3,3x6,9,8x5,9x4,8x4] vs expected [2x2,1,8x2,9,2x2,1,9,8x5,9x4,8x4], wrong headers and overlays (9/8 blocks overwritten incorrectly); row 1 has 4's/2's where expected has 2's/9's, showing 1->4 map applied wrongly and pattern [4,4,2] not matching expected [2,2,2]; repetitive 4/8/9 blocks in rows 5-12 ignore expected cycling of 1/2 patterns; row 13 introduces 6's mismatched to expected 2's, indicating broken cycling for empties.
 * For Training 3: Row 0 all 5's matches, but row 1 generated [5x9,3x3,5x3,3x3,5x3,3x3] vs expected [5x15,3,8,3x2,8,3x2,8,3], wrong extension of 3's and missing 8 insertions; row 2 has 8,3,8 repeats where expected has 3,8x2,3 etc., close but shifted; rows 5-9 mismatch overlays (e.g., row 5 generated 3x6 +8,4x3 etc. vs expected 4x15,3,8x2,4x3,3,8x2), failing to propagate 4's fully; rows 15-19 repetitive 4/6 but expected all 4's, showing over-application of patterns.
 * get_pattern is somewhat helpful for simple lefts but broken for frames with embedded non-zeros or when leading != repeat count.
 * normalize_header is not helpful—overwrites too aggressively, causing header mismatches in all examples where expected has non-extended or alternative starts (e.g., direct 8's in train3).
 * apply_overlay is incorrect—fixed range(9,24,6) misses early overlays (e.g., pos 0 in some expected) and doesn't rotate patterns per row, leading to static repeats; don't use without dynamic start/stride.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of cropping and left extraction but misses vertical/global pattern evolution, conditional normalization, and flexible overlays; consecutive_empty >1 for cycling is too strict, as some expected carries happen on first empty.
 * No functions for vertical alignment or cumulative patterns, which seems essential given row-to-row progressions in expected (e.g., shrinking 5's, expanding 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it retains many 0's from the input crop (e.g., row 0 pos 9-11=0,0,9... but ends with 6,0x4, introducing artifacts not in training expecteds, which avoid 0's in structured blocks), suggesting failed overwriting or pattern application leaves empties untouched.
 * Headers are mostly [5x3,3x6] which may be right for some rows, but overlays insert inconsistent 4/6/3/9 blocks (e.g., row 1: 4,4,6,9x3,4,4,6,9,6,0,4,4,6 with lingering 0's and mismatched 6's where patterns cycle wrongly); row 4 has 3,6,4 repeats but expected likely needs full 9/6 propagation without 0's.
 * Later rows like 13-17 have 0's in pos 12-14/18 (e.g., 3,6,4,0x3,3,6,4,0,6,0,3,6,4), which looks like incomplete overlays or failed normalization, not matching clean block structures in training expecteds (e.g., no 0's, full 3/4/8/9 fills).
 * Row 26 has [5x3,3x6,4x3,9x3,4x3,4,9,6,0,4x3] with 0's and partial 6's, indicating the cycling/overlay logic breaks on long sequences, producing messy outputs unlike expected uniform transformations.
 * Overall, test output makes no sense as a solved puzzle—too many 0's and irregularities suggest the program doesn't fully transform the crop, missing core rules like complete replacement or background filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (likely representing colors, shapes, or symbols in a larger image) where the left margin (first 5-6 columns) of each row encodes instructions or patterns that must be extracted, processed (e.g., rotated, mapped, normalized), and overlaid onto the main body of the grid (columns 6-30, cropped to 24 elements) to complete or transform the image according to repeating or propagating rules. The goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches expected patterns, such as extending headers, filling sections with rotated motifs, or applying cyclic overlays, while handling special cases like empty patterns or frame elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extracted from the left 5 elements of each row; elements 0,6,7 seem to act as "frame" or ignore markers that skip leading positions, but only if they don't fill the entire left side—subtlety: if the entire left is frame, return empty and rotate the previous row's pattern.
 * Empty patterns (all frame or invalid) inherit and rotate the previous row's pattern leftward (cycle shift), but this rotation must preserve length and only apply when needed; easy to miss: rotation happens before mapping/padding, and original length tracks for header normalization.
 * Mapping rule: 1 specifically maps to 4, while other values pass through—subtlety: this is likely a color/symbol substitution, but only for certain extracted elements; don't apply globally.
 * Padding: Patterns shorter than 3 are padded by repeating the last element (or 0 if empty), then truncated to exactly 3—key: this ensures consistent overlay size, but over-padding can cause repetition errors in longer sections.
 * Normalization for headers: Rows with empty patterns (original_len==0) extend leading 5's to exactly 3 positions (overwriting if needed), then extend following 3's to exactly 6 positions—subtlety: this only applies to "header" rows without patterns; it doesn't touch other numbers, and extensions stop at row length (24 after crop).
 * Overlay application: Patterns (padded to 3) are stamped starting at positions 9,15,21 (0-indexed in the 24-element cropped row), overwriting existing values—easy to miss: this creates 3 repeating sections per row, but only if pos <24; it ignores the first 9 positions (likely a fixed left area) and assumes crop starts at original index 6.
 * Grid structure: Input g has rows of at least 30 elements; output is cropped to [6:30] (24 elems) per row, height preserved; patterns propagate vertically via previous_pattern, so row dependencies are crucial—subtlety: no horizontal propagation, but vertical inheritance can create staggered or rotating motifs across rows.
 * Special numbers: 5 often acts as a header/start marker (extends to 3), 3 as a filler/extender (to 6), 8/9 as backgrounds or walls; 4,6,7 as pattern elements; 0/1/2 as placeholders or holes—key: overlays can overwrite these, but extractions must avoid frame pollution.
 * Edge cases: Full-empty rows rotate prior; leading non-frame starts pattern immediately; if leading==0, pattern is just [first]; append non-zero from rest of left—subtlety: this skips 0's in extraction but includes them in patterns sometimes, leading to 0-padding issues.
 * Overall rules: Transform preserves structure but fills/completes sections based on left cues; mismatches often from incorrect extraction (e.g., including frame), wrong rotation timing, or overlay positions; consider vertical continuity and exact length enforcement to avoid spillover.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This extracts patterns by skipping leading frame elements and building from first non-frame, appending non-zeros; useful for left-margin parsing, but buggy on full-frame or mixed 0/non-0.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cycle shift for inheritance; helpful for propagating patterns vertically, but needs careful application only on empties.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads to fixed overlay size; useful, but repetition can amplify errors if pattern is wrong.)

```python
def normalize_header(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    row = row[:]
    # Extend 5's to 3
    i = 0
    num5 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 5:
        num5 += 1
        i += 1
    if num5 < 3:
        for j in range(3 - num5):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 5
    # Extend 3's to 6
    start3 = 0
    while start3 < len(row) and row[start3] == 5:
        start3 += 1
    i = start3
    num3 = 0
    while i < len(row) and row[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for j in range(6 - num3):
            if i + j < len(row):
                row[i + j] = 3
    return row
```
(Handles header extension for empty-pattern rows; partially useful for 5/3 rules, but limited to leading sequences and doesn't handle other fillers like 8/9.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):
        for k in range(len(p)):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Stamps pattern in sections 9-11,15-17,21-23; core for filling, but assumes p len=3 and fixed starts—helpful if positions are correct.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt failed all three training examples, showing partial understanding of left-extraction and overlay but incorrect pattern building, rotation, and normalization.
 * Train 1: Generated short/incomplete 3-extensions (e.g., first row has only four 3's then 0's, but expected 20+ 3's across sections with trailing 5's); mismatched overlays like row 5 having scattered 7/8 instead of uniform 4's, row 8 having 1's in wrong spots vs expected 4's/8's; row 9 has 1's and 4's but expected mixed 8/4/7 with 3-end; unknown why 1's appear (from unmapped extraction?) and rotations don't align vertical motifs.
 * Train 2: Generated repetitive 4's/2's/6's in overlays but ignores left patterns like 2/1/8/9; first row starts with 5/3 but expected 2/1/8/9 blocks; many rows have uniform 4's where expected cyclic 2/1/9/8 sections—missed vertical pattern variation and header omission; 0's and 9's not propagated correctly.
 * Train 3: Generated inconsistent 5/3/8 overlays with 0's and 4's, but expected structured 5-headers then 3/8 motifs in sections; row 1 has 3/8 but expected all-5 then 8's; row 6 has 3/8/3 but expected uniform 4's then 3/8/8; lower rows have 2's/4's/6's where expected all-5 or all-4—rotation and padding over-applied, frame skipping wrong.
 * get_pattern is helpful for extraction but broken: includes leading repeats incorrectly (e.g., * leading but if leading=0 just [first]), skips 0's but not always, and fails on full-frame without proper empty check.
 * rotate_left is useful but applied too broadly (e.g., on non-empties), causing pattern drift.
 * pad_pattern and map_pattern (1->4) are directionally correct but amplify errors (e.g., padding 0's leads to blank sections).
 * normalize_header only for empties but buggy: extends 5 to 3 and 3 to 6, but doesn't handle longer sequences or other numbers like 8/9; unhelpful for non-header rows.
 * apply_overlay positions (9,15,21) seem right for 3-section repeat but overwrites too much/too little, missing first 9 cols and not aligning with expected full-row fills.
 * Overall: No training passed; understanding shows vertical inheritance and sectional overlays, but misses exact extension rules, full pattern cycling, and background preservation—avoid global mapping or fixed paddings without checks.
 * Function map_pattern is simple/subtle-useful (1->4), but normalize_header is partially broken (wrong start3 calc after 5's, limited scope).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it features heavy repetition of 9's and 0's in early columns (likely unprocessed left area), with cyclic overlays of [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] in positions ~9-11/15-17/21-23 across many rows, but introduces inconsistencies like scattered 6's/3's in row 10+ and 0-blocks in rows 13-16, suggesting faulty rotation/padding on varying left inputs (e.g., test left has 9/0 mixes not extracted well).
 * It mismatches puzzle logic: Expected likely has structured 9-backgrounds with rotating 3/4/6 motifs filling sections uniformly (similar to train 2's cycles), but generated has partial overwrites (e.g., row 1 has 9,6,0 at end vs probable full pattern) and abrupt 0-rows (13-16) that should propagate prior patterns; lower rows revert to 4/3/6 cycles but with extra 6's/4's, indicating over-rotation or wrong inheritance—looks messy/incomplete, not matching vertical continuity in trainings.
 * No expected provided, but based on trainings, it should avoid 0-spillover and ensure overlays align across rows (e.g., staggering like train 1's 4/7/8); current output has too many isolated 6's and unnormalized headers, so incorrect—account for 9/6 as potential frames or mappers to fix.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (first 5 cells per row) encodes patterns or instructions (possibly frames, leading indicators, or sequences) that determine transformations or overlays applied to the main content area (crop from index 6 to 29, output as 24 elements). The goal is to process each row independently or with carry-over (e.g., rotation from previous patterns) to produce a modified grid matching expected visual structures, with final blank/edge filling using 9.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Left side (row[0:5]) uses a "frame" set {0,6,7} to detect leading non-content (e.g., borders or spacers); count leading frame elements to determine repetition of the first non-frame value, then append non-zero values from the remaining left cells—subtlety: if all left is frame or empty pattern, rotate from previous row's pattern, but this can propagate errors across rows.
 * Patterns are padded to exactly 3 elements (repeat last or use 0 if empty), then mapped (1 becomes 4, others unchanged) before overlay—easy to miss: overlay applies only to specific positions in crop (starting at index 9, then every 6 steps: 9-11, 15-17, 21-23), suggesting a 4x6 subgrid or column-wise insertion, but ignores earlier crop indices (0-8 stay as-is).
 * Carry-over via previous_pattern update only when a new pattern is detected, else use rotated version—subtlety: rotation is left-cyclic (p[1:] + [p[0]]), which may simulate shifting motifs, but fails if initial patterns are wrong, leading to cascading mismatches.
 * Final post-processing replaces 0 or 6 with 9 across the entire output row (not just crop), implying 0/6 are blanks/edges to be filled uniformly—key: this happens after overlay, so overlays can introduce non-9 values, but expected outputs show structured fills (e.g., solid 3s, 8s, or mixed 4/7/8) rather than sparse insertions.
 * Grid is 20-24 rows high, each row 30+ elements internally but cropped/output to 24; patterns seem to represent colors/shapes (e.g., 3=fill, 4=border, 7/8=patterns, 1=transformed to 4), with expectations showing symmetric or repeating motifs (e.g., rows of uniform 3s, checker-like 4/7/8).
 * Subtle across examples: Training 1 has evolving patterns (3s to 4/7/8 overlays on 3-base), Training 2 cycles 1/2 motifs into 9-base with 4/2 overlays, Training 3 mixes 5-base with 3/8 and 4/2 overlays—common: left encodes short sequences (1-3 elems), but program over-repeats or mis-rotates, leading to uniform 9-fills where structure expected.
 * Easy to miss: No global grid interactions (row-independent except pattern carry), but test input lacks provided left/crop details, so assumptions about input structure (e.g., all-9 base) may fail; outputs must preserve some original crop content while overlaying.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    i = 0
    leading = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        leading += 1
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    first = left[i]
    if first in frame:
        return []
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Repeat first non-frame 'leading' times
    if leading == 0:
        pattern = [first]
    for j in range(i + 1, 5):
        if left[j] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[j])
    return pattern
```
(This function attempts to extract repeating motifs from left, useful for identifying sequence starts after frames, but flawed in repetition logic and empty handling—keep but fix for non-zero appends and frame edge cases.)

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if not p:
        return []
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```
(Simple cyclic shift for pattern carry-over; helpful for simulating rotation in multi-row motifs, but only useful if base patterns are correct.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads short patterns by repetition or 0; essential for consistent 3-element overlays, but 0-padding may introduce unwanted blanks before final 9-fill.)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], pattern: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    p = pad_pattern(pattern)
    p = [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Transform 1 to 4 (possible color/shape map)
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):  # Overlays at 9-11, 15-17, 21-23 in crop
        for k in range(3):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Core overlay logic targeting right-side columns; helpful for inserting patterns into specific sub-areas, but misses left crop (0-8) and assumes crop len=24—adjust range if input varies.)

(The main program function ties these together with previous_pattern tracking and final 9-replacement; partially helpful for structure, but broken in pattern propagation and overlay scope.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs showing excessive 9-fills and misapplied overlays (e.g., sparse 4/3/7/8 insertions where expected solid blocks of 3/8 or repeating 4/7/8 patterns).
 * What worked: Basic left extraction via get_pattern correctly identifies some non-frame starts (e.g., in Train1 row3, detects 3 after leading, overlays 4s matching expected positions); overlay positions (9+) align with right-side motifs in partial matches (e.g., Train1 rows 3-5 have correct 4/7/8 spots but wrong values/context); final 9-replacement fills blanks appropriately in uniform areas (e.g., Train1 row1 ends with 9s like expected 3/5 but mismatched).
 * What didn't work: Pattern repetition over-applies leading count (e.g., Train1 row1 generates [5,5,5,...] but expected uniform 3/5 without repetition); rotation/empty handling propagates wrong patterns (e.g., Train1 rows 9-16 show repeated 4/1/8 but expected varied 4/7/8/1 with 3-edges); mapping 1->4 is inconsistent (Train2 expects 1/2 preserved in left, but overlays 4/2 wrongly); ignores original crop content fully in some rows, leading to all-9 where structure needed (e.g., Train3 rows 10-14 generate uniform 2s/4s but expected all-5s or 4-blocks).
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated has fragmented 4/7/8 (e.g., row6: 7,4,4,8,8,8 but expected solid 4s); row9: 4,4,4,1,1,1 but expected 8,8,8,4,4,4 with trailing 8/3; row17: 4,4,9,8,8,8 but expected 8,8,8,4,7,4; unknown why 1s appear untransformed in some spots.
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated cycles 4/2 overlays on 9-base but expected left-side 1/2/8 motifs with right 9-fills (e.g., row1: generated all-9/4/2 but expected 2,2,1,8,8,9,...); rows 14-20 show repeated 4/9 but expected repeating 2/2/1 blocks; function apply_overlay overwrites too aggressively, losing original 8/9 structure.
 * Train3 mismatches: Generated mixes 5/3/8 overlays but expected symmetric 5/3/8 in specific patterns (e.g., row2: generated 3,3,3 but expected 3,8,3,3,8,3); rows 6-9: 3,8,3 repeats but expected 8,8,8 blocks with 3 edges; rows 16-20: sparse 4/9 but expected uniform 4s—pad_pattern's 0-append + 9-replace creates excess 9s.
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but broken for all-frame left (returns [] too eagerly, leading to rotations); rotate_left is neutral but unhelpful without correct base; apply_overlay positions are useful but scope too narrow (starts at 9, misses 0-8); overall program shows understanding of left->overlay flow but fails on pattern fidelity and carry-over.
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken beyond flaws noted, but the previous_pattern update logic (sets to get_pattern even if rotated) creates loops of bad data—avoid in future without reset.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it consists mostly of 9-fills (blank/edge) with sparse, repeating 4/3 overlays in right positions (e.g., rows 2/6/8/10 have 4,3 patterns at 9-11/15-17/21-23), suggesting over-reliance on rotation/mis-extraction from presumed left input, but lacks the structured motifs seen in training expectations (e.g., no solid blocks or symmetric 1/2/8 like Train2, instead fragmented 3/4 on 9-base).
 * Does not make sense: All rows start/end with 9s, implying heavy blank-filling or failed pattern detection (possibly test left is all-frame, triggering endless rotations of empty/3/4), but expected should mirror training variety (e.g., evolving overlays on base colors like 5/8/9); mismatches subtlety of preserving left-crop content (positions 0-8 are 9s everywhere, but training shows varied starts like 5/8/2).
 * Missing elements: No carry-over diversity (patterns stuck in 4/3 cycle, e.g., rows 4/7/12/15 repeat 9,4,3 but no 7/8/1 transforms); final 9-replace over-applies, creating uniform rows where subtle patterns (e.g., Train3's 3,8,3) expected—likely doesn't handle test's unique left sequences, leading to incorrect sparse output vs. dense expected structures.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where patterns or symbols extracted from a left border (first few columns of each row) are used to overlay, rotate, or decode elements in the main body of the grid, likely representing some form of symbolic or patterned transformation across rows, with repeating motifs like numbers 3,4,7,8 in example 1, 1,2,9 in example 2, and 3,8 in example 3.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The left border (first 5 columns per row) seems to encode patterns, but leading frames like 0,6,7 may indicate no new pattern or continuation, requiring detection of the first non-frame value to start extraction; however, this leads to incorrect overlays if rotation or padding is misapplied.
 * Patterns are short sequences (e.g., 3 elements like [4,7,8] or rotations thereof) that get applied periodically across the row (e.g., every 6 positions starting from index 9 in the cropped grid), but must preserve or interact with existing grid values rather than fully overwriting, as seen in mismatches where overlays ignore underlying structures.
 * Rotation of previous patterns occurs when a row has no new pattern (all frame values), but the rotation direction, frequency, or condition is off—e.g., in example 1, rotations should produce specific sequences like [4,4,4] then [7,4,4] but instead generate incorrect [4,4,7] variants.
 * Mapping rules are subtle: e.g., 1 maps to 4 in some contexts, but not universally, and padding with repeats (e.g., last value) fails when patterns vary in length or when empty patterns should propagate differently.
 * Grid cropping ignores the first 6 columns consistently, assuming they are borders, but this may crop too much or too little, leading to positional errors in overlays (e.g., applying at starts 9,15,21 but missing alignments).
 * Subtle elements: Patterns may reset or cycle independently per "section" of the grid (e.g., upper vs lower in example 1), and empty rows or all-5/8/9 borders indicate solid fills without overlays; also, some rows in expectations show blended values (e.g., 4's overlaying on 3's but retaining shapes), suggesting non-destructive application.
 * Across attempts, failures in propagating patterns across blank left borders cause cascading errors, like in example 2 where rotations should cycle [1,2] motifs but produce static 4's; example 3 shows failure to handle vertical alignments or section breaks.
 * Considerations: Grids have consistent width (24 after crop?), height varies (20 rows in ex1/2, but code assumes full len(g)); numbers represent colors/symbols (e.g., 3=background, 4=pattern element, 7/8=extensions); test input has repeating cycles in left (e.g., [4,3,6] rotations) suggesting a cyclic pattern puzzle.

        p.append(p[-1] if p else 0)
    return p  # Somewhat helpful for standardizing to 3 elements, but unhelpful if patterns are >3 or need exact lengths; causes repeats where expectations vary (e.g., [4] pads to [4,4,4] but sometimes should be [4,0,0]).
```

def map_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [4 if x == 1 else x for x in p]  # Specific to mapping 1->4, helpful for example 1/2 where 1 appears, but irrelevant/broken for example 3 (no 1's) and test (no 1's); don't use broadly.

    result = row[:]
    for start in range(9, 24, 6):

            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result  # Core but broken: Overwrites absolutely without blending (e.g., expectations show partial fills like 4 on 3 but retaining 3's); starts at 9 too late/ignores offsets; step 6 assumes fixed motif width.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, with no rows matching expectations, indicating fundamental misunderstanding of pattern extraction, rotation, and overlay logic.
 * In training example 1: Generated overlays incorrect from row 5 onward—e.g., row 5 has [4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4] vs expected [4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4,8,8,8,4,7,4] (wait, similar but row 6 generated [8,8,7,4,4,4,8,8,8,7,4,4,8,8,8,7,4,4] vs expected all 4's, missing full fill; row 8 generated [4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4] vs expected [8,8,8,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,4]—rotation off by one, and no blending with 8's; lower rows like 12 generated [1,1,8,...] vs expected [8,1,1,8,...], mapping 1->4 but positions wrong; overall, too many 4/7/8 mixes where expectations have solid sections or different rotations (e.g., row 18 expected all 4's overlay but generated partial 3's).
 * In training example 2: Generated mostly static 4's and incorrect 2/6 inserts—e.g., row 1 [8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,2,8,8,8,4,4,2,9,9,8,4,4,2] vs expected [2,2,2,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8] (ignores left pattern [2,2,2] entirely, overlays 4/2 wrongly; rows 13-20 generate cycling 4/6 but expectations cycle [2,2,1]/[1,2,1] motifs without 4/6, suggesting no mapping needed and rotation direction wrong—generated left-rotates to 6/4/3 but expected right-cycles 1/2 patterns).
 * In training example 3: Generated inconsistent overlays and wrong fills—e.g., row 1 all 5's vs expected partial 8's on right; row 5 [3,3,8,5,...] vs expected [3,8,3,5,...] (positions swapped); row 6 [2,2,2,...] vs expected [8,8,8,...] (wrong pattern start, 2 instead of 8); lower rows like 10 all 2's vs expected all 4's (rotation/padding fails to switch); function get_pattern prepends wrongly for left borders like [0,3,8], producing [3,8,3?] instead of [3,8]; crop_left_border assumes fixed 6-col border but example 3 has varying 5's/8's that should propagate as fills.
 * Missed rotation on empty left borders consistently, causing static patterns (e.g., ex1 rows 12-13 stay [1,1,1] mapped to [4,4,4] but should rotate to [8,1,1] etc.); apply_overlay overwrites without checking existing values, leading to loss of background like 3's in ex1.
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but broken for non-leading patterns (e.g., skips too many or repeats first wrongly); map_pattern is unhelpful/irrelevant for ex3 and test (no 1's, causes false 4's); pad_pattern forces 3-len but expectations have variable (e.g., ex2 [1,2] cycles without padding).
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better left parsing; previous logic assumes universal 3-element motifs but ex2 has 3-element [1,2,1] that repeats without rotation in blocks.
 * Train 1 mismatches in mid-section (rows 6-9) where generated has scattered 4/7/8 but expected solid 4's then 7-interspersed, unknown reason but likely wrong rotation trigger.
 * Train 2 has complete failure to detect [1,2,1]/[2,2,1] from left, generating 4's instead—mapping over-applied.
 * Train 3 upper half generated partial 3/8 but expected mirrored/aligned 3/8 blocks; lower half wrong fills (2's vs 4's/5's).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears nonsensical—e.g., rows 0-3 cycle [4,3,6]/[3,6,4]/[6,4,3] overlays starting at pos 9, but with inconsistent 0's and 6's in left/mid (row 0: [9's,0's,9's,6,0's]; row 10: inserts 3's wrongly at end); repeating blocks (rows 5-7 mirror 1-3 but expectations likely need cyclic rotation without overwriting 9's/0's fully, as test left has rotating [4,3,6] suggesting output should propagate that cycle across right sections without introducing extra 3's/4's in non-pattern spots (e.g., row 13 all 0's base but overlays [6,4,3] cleanly); lower rows (14-17) have 0-base with overlays, but row 18+ revert to 9-base with cycles, mismatched to expected solid sections or blended 0/6/9; overall, too many forced 4's/mappings where test has no 1's, and positions like pos 20-23 have erratic 0/3/4/6 vs likely clean cycle [4,3,6,9's]; does not account for section breaks (e.g., row 13-17 as 0-block needing different handling), making it look like over-rotated junk rather than patterned output.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where small "blobs" or non-zero patterns in the leftmost columns (0-5) of an input grid influence modifications to a base canvas extracted from the right side (columns 6+), such as color propagation, hole filling, and patterned interleaving or replacement in affected rows, ultimately producing a stylized or rule-based output grid of the same dimensions. The goal is to infer and apply consistent rules from training examples to correctly transform unseen test inputs, focusing on preserving large components while adapting small ones based on left-side cues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Affected rows are those with non-zero values in columns 0-4 (or possibly 0-5), indicating "small blobs" that trigger changes only in those rows, while unaffected rows remain mostly as in the base canvas.
 * Base canvas is typically the right 24 columns (starting from column 6), preserving large connected components (e.g., long horizontal runs of the same number) unless modified by left-side influences.
 * Propagation of colors from left blobs: Small left patterns (e.g., 1-2 cells) often replicate or extend into the left edge of the canvas in affected rows, but not always as simple fills—may involve matching shapes or alternating with dominant canvas colors.
 * Hole filling in large components: Zeros (0s) in affected rows' large blobs should be filled with the row's dominant color, but only within connected large structures; over-filling entire rows or ignoring connectivity leads to mismatches.
 * Y-range transformations: Changes vary by row position or groups (e.g., interleaving patterns like every 3rd cell with a secondary color such as 4,7, or 8), but must respect specific sequences seen in expectations (e.g., repeating triplets like 4-4-7 or 3-8-3); simple modulo-3 interleaving often distorts lengths or positions.
 * Subtle elements: Left blobs can indicate specific patterns (e.g., a single non-zero might trigger minimal changes, while pairs like 6-6 suggest extensions); large canvas components (e.g., runs of 8s or 9s) should not be fully overwritten unless explicitly cued; zeros in expectations are rare and purposeful, not always filled; row groups (e.g., upper vs. lower halves) may have thematic colors (5s top, 4s bottom); connectivity matters—treat horizontal runs as objects, but vertical alignment across rows can influence propagation.
 * Easy-to-miss: Dominant color calculation should consider only non-zero cells in the canvas row, not including left blobs initially; secondary colors for interleaving should be chosen from present canvas colors (prioritizing 4>7>8), not hardcoded; transformations must maintain exact 24-column width without truncation or padding errors; some rows in expectations show asymmetric patterns (e.g., longer runs on one side), suggesting non-uniform application.
 * All considerations: Avoid global changes—modifications are row-specific and only for affected rows; test for blob sizes (small: 1-3 cells, medium: 4-6, large: 7+ in row); potential for shape mirroring (e.g., left blob [1,1] mirrors to canvas edge); handle cases where left has no blobs (copy base unchanged); zeros might represent transparency or errors to preserve in some contexts.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt structured the program modularly with functions for base extraction, affected row detection, color propagation, hole filling, and y-range transformations, which is helpful for debugging but overall incorrect as all training examples failed.
 * What worked: Correctly identified affected rows based on left non-zeros (e.g., in training 1, rows with 7s or 5s on left were targeted); base canvas extraction preserved right-side structure initially; dominant color calculation for filling was conceptually sound but over-applied (e.g., filled entire rows instead of holes only).
 * What didn't work: Propagation was too simplistic (replicated first left color to first 3 canvas positions, but expectations show more nuanced extensions like matching blob size or interleaving with canvas colors, e.g., training 1 row 1 expected all 5s extended but generated mixed 7-3); hole filling ignored connectivity, filling all 0s row-wide (e.g., training 1 row 3 generated 8s where expected has specific 4-7-8 patterns); y-range transformations used flawed modulo-3 interleaving that skipped indices incorrectly, leading to length mismatches and wrong secondary colors (e.g., forced 4/7/8 without checking presence, distorting patterns like expected 3-4-4-7 in training 1); no blob size classification, treating all left non-zeros uniformly.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated heavy 7-3 repetition in upper rows (e.g., row 1: [7,7,3,7,7,...] vs expected [5,5,5,5,3,...] with 5-extension); lower rows filled 8s/1s incorrectly (e.g., row 9: extra 1s at end vs expected mixed 4-7-8 without trailing 1); interleaving created uneven triplets, e.g., row 3 generated [7,7,3,7,7,7,...] but expected [5,5,5,3,3,3,3,...] with no 7s.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Upper rows incorrectly propagated 1/2 to canvas left without pattern matching (e.g., row 0: [8,8,8,8,8,9,...] vs expected [2,2,1,8,8,9,...] showing left blob [2,2,1?] influencing specific positions); repeated 4s/8s/9s in middle but ignored expected 1-2-1 triplets (e.g., row 2 generated uniform 8-9 but expected [1,2,1,8,8,9,...]); lower rows over-filled 6s into 9-patterns without alternation.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Top rows incorrectly introduced 3s/8s where expected solid 5s or minimal changes (e.g., row 1: [8,8,5,3,3,...] vs expected [5,5,5,5,5,...] with 3-8 only in specific right positions); bottom 4-rows filled 6s uniformly but expected preserved 4s with inserted 3-8 patterns (e.g., row 6: [4,4,4,2,2,...] vs expected [4,4,4,4,4,...3,8,8,...]); no handling for unaffected rows staying solid (e.g., rows 11-14 expected all 5s but generated mixed).
 * Function `propagate_small_colors` is broken (over-replicates to fixed 3 positions, ignores blob shape/size—don't use as-is). 
 * Function `modify_holes_in_large` is partially helpful but overzealous (fills all 0s, not just holes in large blobs—refine with connectivity check). 
 * Function `apply_y_range_transformations` is unhelpful (modulo-3 logic distorts lengths and chooses wrong secondaries—replace with pattern matching from expectations). 
 * Function `identify_affected_rows` and `extract_base_canvas` are correct and essential (keep and build on them). 
 * No object extraction function was used effectively; adding blob extraction (as in helpful tools above) is needed for better propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it relies on the same flawed program that failed all training examples, producing repetitive patterns (e.g., heavy 8-9-6/1/4/7 blocks with sudden 0s in rows 13-16) that don't align with expected subtlety from training (e.g., no nuanced interleaving like 3-8-3 or 4-7-4, instead uniform fills).
 * Upper rows show over-propagation of 6/1 into 8/9/4 backgrounds (e.g., row 0: [8,8,9,6,6,...] likely from left blob influence, but too uniform vs. training's varied extensions); middle rows introduce unexplained 0s (e.g., row 13: [7,7,0,7,7,...] suggesting failed hole filling, but expectations rarely have 0s—should be filled with dominant 7 or 9).
 * Lower rows repeat upper patterns without variation (e.g., rows 17-20 mirror rows 0-3 with 8-9-6, but training shows row-specific y-range differences like upper 5s vs. lower 4s—test lacks this stratification).
 * Overall, test output lacks the patterned insertions (e.g., triplets or alternations) seen in training expectations, instead showing blocky repetitions that ignore blob sizes; it makes sense as an extension of the program's errors but is incorrect because it doesn't mentally match inferred rules (e.g., for test's apparent left 9-6/1 patterns, expect something like 9-extended with 6-6 inserted into 8/4 runs, not full left fills).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the transformation of a grid (likely representing a visual layout like a calendar, diagram, or patterned image) by extracting patterns from a left border area, applying rules for mapping, padding, rotation, and special accents based on global elements like the presence of 8, and then overlaying these patterns onto the main content area while handling headers and empty sections differently. The goal is to normalize and decorate the grid to match expected outputs, possibly simulating visual effects like borders, fills, or accents in a puzzle image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a left border (first 5-6 columns) that encodes patterns for each row, with frame values {0,6,7} to skip, and non-zero values indicating the pattern (e.g., leading frames repeat the first non-frame value).
 * Crop the left 6 columns to focus on the main 24-column content area.
 * Global check for 8 in the entire cropped grid to trigger mappings (e.g., 1 -> 4).
 * For non-empty patterns, pad to exactly 3 elements by repeating the last; for empty left borders (all frames or zeros), use consecutive empty count: rotate previous pattern if 1 empty, [4,4,4] if >1, or empty if none.
 * Headers (rows with empty patterns) need normalization: extend leading 5s to exactly 3 positions, and following 3s to exactly 6 positions.
 * Special accent rule: If pattern is all 4s and grid has 8, change to [4,4,7] only if the row contains 8 (subtle: row-specific check, not global).
 * Overlay the 3-element pattern starting at column 9 (0-indexed in cropped grid), repeating every 6 columns (positions 9-11, 15-17, 21-23).
 * Subtleties: Patterns can be short (1-4 elements), leading zeros/frames create repetitions; consecutive empties propagate rotated or filled patterns; 1s only map to 4s if 8 exists globally, but this interacts with accents; headers might appear mid-grid, not just top; empty patterns don't overlay but normalize; rotations are left-shifts; padding uses last element or 0 if empty.
 * Across attempts (implied from code evolution), consider that patterns might not always start immediately after frames, and non-pattern values (e.g., 9,2 in ex2) require different handling than assumed (e.g., no universal mapping); empty sections can be long and need consistent filling; overlays don't affect all columns (e.g., 0-8 and 12-14 untouched except in headers).
 * Other considerations: Grids vary in theme (ex1: 3/4/5/7/8 heavy, ex2: 2/8/9 heavy, ex3: 3/5/8 heavy, test: 0/1/3/4/6/9 heavy), so rules must generalize beyond 8-specific logic; test has many 0s and 9s, suggesting borders/frames and fillers that might need ignoring or special empty handling; subtle mismatches in positions (e.g., overlays starting too early/late) break symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt shows partial understanding of left-border pattern extraction and overlay mechanics but fails all training examples due to incorrect handling of non-8 grids (ex2/ex3) and misapplied rules like accents/mappings where 8 isn't dominant.
 * Train 1: Generated extends 5s/3s correctly in header (row0 matches), applies [4,4,7] overlays well in some rows (e.g., row3/4 match accents), but mismatches in row1 (uses [4,4,7] overlay too early, expected plain 3s); row2 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected [4,4,4]); row5 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected all 4s fill); row6 ( [4,4,7] but expected [4,4,7] with 4s in non-overlay); row7 similar but expected more 4s/7s shifted; row8 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected all 8s then 4s); row9-12 (1s not fully mapped or patterned wrong, expected varied 1/4/7/8); row13 (overlays [4,4,7] but expected all 8s then [4,7,4]); row14 (similar, expected all 8s then 4s); row15-20 mismatches in 3/5 extensions and overlays (e.g., row17 expected all 4s fill, got partial overlay).
 * Train 2: Completely mismatches, as it assumes 8-presence mapping but ex2 has no 1s/4s dominance; generated overlays [4,4,7]/[4,4,2] etc. on 9/8 areas, but expected uses left patterns like [2,2,1] directly without mapping, and overlays only in specific blocks (e.g., row0 expected [2,2,1] in positions 0-2/6-8 but got 5/3/9); entire grid generated with wrong base fills (e.g., row1 got [4,4,2] but expected [2,2,2] in left/mid); no recognition of repeating [2,2,1]/[2,2,2]/[1,2,1] cycles from left border.
 * Train 3: Fails to handle 5/8/3 patterns properly; generated all-5 headers and [2,2,2]/[4,4,4] overlays, but expected mixes 3/8 in overlays/headers (e.g., row1 expected [3,8,3] repeating but got [3,3,3]); row2 expected [3,8,8] but got [8,3,8]; row5 expected [3,8,8] overlay on 4s but got all 4s; lower rows (11-15) got plain 5s/4s but expected plain 5s; bottom all-4s match but upper mismatches show poor pattern extraction for 3/8.
 * Function `normalize_header` works for ex1 row0 but overextends in ex3 (applies to non-headers); `get_pattern` skips frames ok but misses repeating non-zeros in ex2 (e.g., treats 2/1 as single); `special_accent` applies [4,4,7] too broadly in ex1 (where not all rows have 8); `map_1_to_4` irrelevant/unhelpful for ex2/ex3 (no 1s, causes wrong 4-fills); overall program composition tracks consecutive empties well but fails when patterns aren't 1/4-based.
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better left-pattern parsing beyond current `get_pattern` (e.g., handle 2/9 as direct patterns without 4-mapping).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it applies [4,4,4] overlays consistently from row5 onward, but leaves many 0s/9s/6s untouched or partially overlaid (e.g., row0 has [0,0,9] in mid but expected likely normalized 9s or patterned fills based on left 0s indicating empty/header); row1-4 show rotating [1,1,6]/[1,3,6]/[3,6,1]/[4,4,4] but with 9/6/0 remnants, suggesting incomplete overlay (expected full block fills like all-9s with pattern accents, similar to ex2's 8/9 blocks); rows 14-17 all-0 left leads to [4,4,4] but with 0/6 scattered, not a clean fill (expected perhaps all-0 or propagated pattern like ex1 empties); later rows revert to [4,4,4] on 9s but end with mismatched 3/6 (e.g., row22 has 6,4,4,4 but likely expected uniform); overall, too many 0/6/9 persist, no header normalization on top 0-left rows, and no global 8 so 1s stay 1s but overlays ignore left variety (e.g., row10 left implies [4,4,4] ok, but row1's [1,1,6] not rotated properly); doesn't make sense as it looks patchy, not symmetric/blocky like expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where each row has a 5-cell "instruction" or "key" on the left (positions 0-4) that determines a pattern to extract and overlay or modify onto the main 24-cell image area (likely positions 6-29 in a 30-cell row, cropped to 24 elements). The goal is to transform the input grid by applying these per-row patterns, possibly simulating some kind of stamping, filling, or visual completion rule, with patterns carrying over rows under certain conditions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The left 5 cells (row[0:5]) act as a pattern extractor: initial cells matching a "frame" set {0,6,7} are skipped to find a leading non-frame value; if all 5 are frame, no new pattern is extracted and the previous row's pattern is reused.
 * Patterns are built by collecting non-frame, non-zero values after the leading point, then padded to exactly 3 elements (repeating the last if short, or 0 if empty); special case if the original pattern is all 1s, transform it to [4,7,4] and flag for different overlay behavior.
 * Overlay application starts at position 9 in the 24-cell crop (0-based index), repeating the 3-element pattern every 3 positions (step=3) if all_one flag is true, or every 6 positions (step=6) otherwise; only applies up to position 23.
 * Carry-over of patterns across rows when left is all frame (e.g., all 0s or mixtures of 0/6/7) is crucial, but the flag for all_one must also carry over.
 * Grids seem to represent visual elements like shapes, fills, or stamps (e.g., 3s for fills, 4-7 for patterns like borders or waves, 8s for solids, 1s/2s for small details); outputs must preserve unchanged parts of the crop unless overlaid.
 * Subtle: Padding and all_one handling alter the pattern non-trivially (e.g., all 1s becomes [4,7,4], which might represent a specific visual motif like a repeating border); overlays don't affect the first 9 positions of the crop.
 * Row lengths in outputs are fixed at 24, suggesting a consistent cropping from input rows (row[6:30]), ignoring left/right margins.
 * Patterns may represent "objects" or "stamps" that need to be placed at specific offsets, potentially aligning with visual alignments in the expected outputs (e.g., matching columns for shapes).
 * Easy to miss: Non-zero but frame values (like 6/7) in left might indicate boundaries, not patterns; empty patterns lead to no change; overlays can overwrite existing values without blending.
 * Across attempts (this single provided one), considerations include handling variable pattern lengths, row dependencies for carry-over, and position-specific stamping; but ignores potential column-wise interactions or global grid rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    frame = {0, 6, 7}
    leading = 0
    while leading < 5 and left[leading] in frame:
        leading += 1
    if leading == 5:
        return []
    pattern = []
    first = left[leading]
    pattern = [first] * leading  # Note: This prepends leading repeats of first, but may be incorrect as it doesn't match expectations
    for i in range(leading + 1, 5):
        if left[i] not in frame and left[i] != 0:
            pattern.append(left[i])
    return pattern
```
(This extracts a potential pattern from left, skipping frame; helpful for identifying instructions but buggy in prepending repeats.)

```python
def pad_pattern(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    while len(p) < 3:
        if p:
            p.append(p[-1])
        else:
            p.append(0)
    return p[:3]
```
(Pads extracted pattern to 3 elements by repeating last or adding 0s; useful for standardizing overlay inputs.)

```python
def is_all_one(p: List[int]) -> bool:
    return all(x == 1 for x in p)
```
(Checks for special all-1s case; helpful for triggering pattern transforms like to [4,7,4].)

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int], all_one: bool) -> List[int]:
    result = row[:]
    step = 3 if all_one else 6
    for start in range(9, 24, step):
        for k in range(len(p)):
            pos = start + k
            if pos < 24:
                result[pos] = p[k]
    return result
```
(Overlays pattern starting at index 9 in crop, with step based on all_one; core for modification but starts too late/misses alignments in expectations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only provided one) correctly identifies left[0:5] as pattern source and crops to 24 elements, with carry-over logic for empty patterns—worked partially for rows with clear patterns (e.g., in Train 1 rows 7-14, it applies [4,7,4] overlays matching some expected borders).
 * get_pattern prepends leading repeats of first non-frame value, which didn't work (e.g., in Train 1 row 6, leading=2 but prepends two 3s incorrectly, leading to mismatched fills); should likely just start from leading without repeats.
 * Overlay starts at fixed 9 with steps 3/6, which worked for some repeating motifs (e.g., Train 1 rows with 4,7,4) but failed broadly: in Train 1 row 3, generated [4,4,4,8,8,8,...] vs expected [4,4,7,8,8,8,...] (misses 7 insertion, unknown why—possibly wrong step or start pos).
 * All_one handling to [4,7,4] worked in isolated cases (e.g., Train 1 row 7 matches expected [4,7,4] repeats) but over-applied or mis-stepped elsewhere (e.g., Train 1 row 9 generated all [4,7,4] but expected mixes with 8s and 1s).
 * Carry-over helped in sequences of empty lefts (e.g., Train 1 rows 10-14 reuse pattern, partially matching fills) but failed when expectations shift to new motifs (e.g., row 9 expected 8s and 1s, not continued 4,7,4).
 * In Train 2, pattern extraction from lefts like [8,8,8,8,8] (all frame?) led to empty/reuse, generating uniform [4,4,4] overlays that don't match expected small patterns like [2,2,1] or [1,2,1] (misses extracting non-frame details like 1/2).
 * Train 3 generated mostly uniform fills/overlays (e.g., rows 1-2 with [3,3,3] but expected varied [3,8,3]); pad_pattern added repeats incorrectly for short patterns.
 * apply_overlay is helpful for stamping but broken for alignment: starts at 9 (skipping first ~9 cells, which matches some unchanged prefixes) but step=6 misses dense patterns (e.g., Train 2 expects [1,2,1] every few cols, not sparse).
 * get_pattern is partially helpful but incorrect/unhelpful for cases where left has mixed frame/non-frame without clear leading (e.g., ignores potential patterns in frame positions?); don't rely on prepending logic.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of row-wise processing and overlays but misses: variable start positions per row, blending vs overwrite, or extracting patterns from entire left without frame skip; no column-wise or global rules considered.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and seems mostly wrong, as it generates repetitive, uniform overlays (e.g., many rows with [1,3,3] pattern stamped from pos 9 every 6 steps, leading to [...,9,9,9,1,3,3,9,6,0,...]) that don't form coherent visuals; for instance, rows 1-9/18-22 all identical with [1,3,3] despite varying input lefts, suggesting failed pattern extraction/variation.
 * It over-applies carry-over (e.g., rows 3-8/10-13 reuse same [1,3,3] but input lefts differ, e.g., row 2 has potential 4,7,4? Wait, generated row 1 has [4,7,4] briefly but then shifts); expected likely has more varied stamps aligning to visual objects (e.g., filling holes or completing shapes with 0s in cols 7-10/20-23).
 * Rows 13-15 shift to 0-prefix but still stamp [1,3,3], which looks incorrect as it ignores the all-0 left (should carry over but perhaps reset or match expected sparse fills); row 23 has [4,1,3,3] anomaly, possibly from mis-pad.
 * Later rows (26-30) introduce [4,4,4] but with 6s/0s mismatches (e.g., col 19=6 unchanged, but overlays overwrite inconsistently); overall, lacks visual sense—no clear shapes emerge, unlike expectations in trainings (e.g., no matching borders or fills); likely needs dynamic start/step per pattern type to handle test's 0-heavy and 9/6 areas.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 03:03:04] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of rows, where the left portion (likely columns 0-5) of each row encodes an instruction or pattern (using numbers like 0,6 for frames, 7 for repeats, 1 for special rotations, etc.) that determines how to fill or overlay a repeating motif onto the main content area (likely columns 6-29, sliced to 24 elements in outputs) on the right side. The goal is to generate a transformed grid that matches expected visual patterns, such as uniform fills, repeated tiles, or structured motifs like borders of 5s/3s, waves of 8s/3s, or cyclic sequences of 1/2 with backgrounds of 8/9.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The left side (g[i][0:5]) often starts with frame elements (0 or 6), followed by leading/trailing 7s indicating repetition counts for a base value; the get_pattern function attempts to capture this but fails to handle variable lengths or non-7 separators correctly, leading to incomplete or wrong patterns (e.g., it assumes patterns end abruptly and pads to exactly 3, but expected outputs show longer or irregular repeats).
 * Empty left sides (all frames or no pattern) should inherit/rotate from previous non-empty patterns, but the current get_empty_pattern only rotates once or defaults to [4,4,4], which doesn't match cases where empties propagate longer sequences (e.g., train 1 rows 18-19 expect full 3s, not 0s).
 * Special handling for all-1s patterns rotates a base [4,4,7], but this seems arbitrary and doesn't align with expected motifs (e.g., train 1 row 12 expects [1,1,1,1] integrated differently, not rotated to 4/7 overlays).
 * Overlay application starts at position 9 (0-indexed in the 24-element slice), with steps of 3 (if 1 present in left) or 6 (otherwise), but this misplaces patterns—expected outputs often have full-row fills (e.g., all 4s in train 1 row 5) or left/right symmetry (e.g., train 2's 1/2 on both sides), suggesting overlays might need to cover from 0 or adjust dynamically.
 * Post-processing like normalize_header extends 5s (borders?) and 3s (fill?), but it's too rigid: it only pads leading 5s to 3 and 3s to 6, ignoring cases needing full-row 5s (train 3 row 0) or mixed 3/8 without padding (train 3 row 1).
 * Subtle elements: Patterns can be cyclic/rotating across rows (e.g., train 2 cycles 2,2,1 / 2,2,2 / 1,2,1 every 3 rows, with 8/9 backgrounds); 8 often represents a "wave" or connector that interacts with 3/9; 0s in expected are rare and seem like placeholders for empty/zero-fill, but generated often leaves them unhandled; rows aren't independent—consecutive empties build on prior (but current code resets too aggressively); full grid context matters (e.g., vertical alignment across rows for motifs like train 3's 8/3 checker).
 * Overlays replace but preserve some existing content? Generated often overwrites everything with pattern, but expected blends (e.g., train 1 row 4 keeps 8s in expected but generated shifts them wrong).
 * Pad_pattern forces to 3 elements, but expected patterns vary in length (e.g., train 1 row 8 has 8x8 then 4s then 3, longer than 3); the [4 if x==1 else x] substitution seems like a hack for 1->4 but breaks when 1s are structural (train 2).
 * If all 4s in pattern and 8 present, force [4,4,7]—this is a patch but doesn't trigger correctly (e.g., train 1 row 5 generates mixed 8/4/7 instead of all 4s).
 * Broader: Numbers likely represent colors/shapes (5=border, 3/9=fill, 4=empty tile, 7=repeat marker, 8=wave/edge, 1/2=small motifs, 6=variant fill); puzzle may involve tiling rules where left encodes tile type/rotation, and right is the canvas to tile.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current functions provide a starting point for left-side parsing and overlay but are mostly broken or incomplete—get_pattern partially extracts repeats but mishandles non-7 elements and variable bases; rotate_left is useful for cyclic patterns; apply_overlay is conceptually right but wrong on positioning/step (should perhaps start at 0 and use grid width); normalize_header helps with border/fill extension but needs generalization for arbitrary counts. No types defined, but a Pattern class could hold base, repeat_count, rotation.

```python
def get_pattern(left: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Existing: Attempts to skip frames, count leading7, take base, add trailing7, append rest.
    # Helpful for basic repeat detection (e.g., catches 7s in train 1 row 3), but broken for non-repeating or frame-interrupted (e.g., train 3's 3/8 mixes).
    frame = {0, 6}
    i = 0
    while i < 5 and left[i] in frame:
        i += 1
    if i == 5:
        return []
    leading7 = 0
    j = i
    while j < 5 and left[j] == 7:
        leading7 += 1
        j += 1
    if j == 5:
        return []
    base = left[j]
    j += 1
    pattern = [base] * (leading7 + 1)
    trailing7 = 0
    while j < 5 and left[j] == 7:
        trailing7 += 1
        j += 1
    pattern += [7] * trailing7
    while j < 5 and left[j] not in frame and left[j] != 0:
        pattern.append(left[j])
        j += 1
    return pattern
```

```python
def rotate_left(p: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Existing: Simple cycle left. Helpful for rotating base patterns like [4,4,7] or 1/2 motifs in train 2.
    if len(p) == 0:
        return p
    return p[1:] + [p[0]]
```

```python
def apply_overlay(row: List[int], p: List[int], step: int) -> List[int]:
    # Existing: Overlays pattern every step starting at 9. Conceptually useful but broken—starts too late (expected often fills from 0), fixed step ignores pattern length, overwrites all without blending.
    result = row[:]
    pos = 9
    while pos < 24:
        for k in range(len(p)):
            if pos + k < 24:
                result[pos + k] = p[k]
        pos += step
    return result
```

```python
def normalize_header(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Existing: Pads leading 5s to 3 and following 3s to 6. Somewhat helpful for border cases (e.g., extends 5s in train 1 row 0), but broken for non-leading or longer extensions (e.g., train 3 needs full 5s or 8/3 without fixed counts).
    result = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 24 and result[i] == 5:
        i += 1
    num5 = i
    if num5 < 3:
        for k in range(3 - num5):
            if i + k < 24:
                result[i + k] = 5
    i = 0
    while i < 24 and result[i] == 5:
        i += 1
    start3 = i
    num3 = 0
    while i < 24 and result[i] == 3:
        num3 += 1
        i += 1
    if num3 < 6:
        for k in range(6 - num3):
            if i + k < 24:
                result[i + k] = 3
    return result
```

The following are unhelpful or broken: get_empty_pattern (only single rotate or [4,4,4] default doesn't handle multi-row propagation, e.g., train 1 empties should fill 3s consistently); pad_pattern (forces to 3, but patterns need variable length/repeats).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt parses left for patterns and overlays, which works partially for repeat detection (e.g., train 1 row 3 generates correct [4,4,7] overlay positions for 8s) but fails overall due to wrong starting pos (9 too late, e.g., train 1 row 0 generates partial 3s/4s instead of full 3s after 5s), incorrect stepping (6-step skips too much, e.g., train 2 generates uniform 4/7 instead of 1/2 cycles), and over-aggressive replacement (wipes existing 8/9 without blending, e.g., train 1 row 5 has scattered 8s/7 instead of uniform 4s).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Row 0 generated [5x5,3x6,4,3x3,4x3,3x3,4x3] vs expected [5x5,3x17,5x2]—overlays 4s wrongly in fill area; row 5 generated mixed 8/4/7 vs all 4s (overlay didn't clear 8s); row 8 generated 8x5 then 4/7 but expected 8x8 then 4x8 then 8x2,3 (wrong repeat length); row 12 generated 1s misplaced vs expected 1x4 then 4s/8s; row 18-19 generated 0s vs full 3s (empty handling failed propagation). Unknown why 1->4 substitution breaks structural 1s.
 * Train 2 mismatches: All rows generate 8/9 with 4/7 or 2 overlays, but expected has symmetric left/right 1/2 motifs on 8/9 background (e.g., row 0 expected [2,2,1,8x4,9,2,2,1,9,8x5] vs generated full overlay from 9, missing left-side copy); cycles not detected (generated repeats same [4,4,7] every row vs expected rotating 1/2 every 3 rows); row 17-19 generated 0s vs full 8/9 (empty default wrong).
 * Train 3 mismatches: Row 0 generated mixed 5/3/4 vs full 5x9 then 8x8 (no 8 detection); row 2 generated 8/3 scattered vs 3/8/3 patterns; rows 6-8 generated 2/4 vs 8/3 waves or full 4s (wrong base from left); rows 18-19 generated 6/4/9 vs expected full 4s (overlay with 6 unhandled); function like get_pattern misses 3/8 as base without 7s.
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need for better left parsing; current program shows core misunderstanding of full-row vs partial overlay and row interdependence.
 * Unhelpful: The all-1s rotation to [4,4,7] is irrelevant (doesn't appear in expects); [4 if x==1] breaks motifs; consecutive_empty only counts but doesn't propagate correctly.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it repeats similar patterns across rows (e.g., many [5x3,3x6,4x3,9x3,4x3,9,6,0,4x3] or 9/0/6 fills) without variation or symmetry, suggesting the overlay logic is stuck on a single pattern type (likely from left parsing failing on 9/6/0 mixes, treating them as base without repeats). This doesn't make sense for a puzzle, as expects from training show diversity (cycles, waves, full fills); e.g., rows 1-2 have 9/0 then 7/4 or 4/3, but if puzzle rules apply uniformly, test should have structured 9/6 motifs blended with existing (like train 2's 8/9), not scattered 0s/6s or uniform 4s overwriting; rows 13-17 have all 0s or 6/0, which seem like failed empty handling (expects likely propagate 9/6 patterns, not zero out). Without expected test, but based on training, it's incorrect due to lack of blending/cycling and over-reliance on fixed steps/padding—probably misses that 6/9 are variants of 3/8 needing special repeat rules, and 0s should be preserved or filled contextually.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
