=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 19:55:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 20:07:38] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based puzzle involving sequential row processing to simulate "pouring" and "cap spreading" mechanics, where numbers like 6 (possibly caps or barriers), 7 (possibly liquid or open spaces), and 2 (possibly triggers or groups) interact vertically and horizontally across rows. The goal is to transform an input grid by applying these rules in a forward pass, starting from the top row and propagating effects downward.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The pouring rule only applies vertically between consecutive rows: a 7 in the current row becomes 6 if directly below a 6 in the previous row, but only after copying the input row and modifying in place—subsequent spreads can override this.
 * Cap spreading is triggered by consecutive groups of 2's in the *next* row (below the current one), and only if at least one 6 exists in the current row overlapping that group; it then horizontally spreads 6's to any 7's in the current row within an expanded range (one cell left/right of the group), but only on positions that were originally 7 in the input row for that row.
 * Processing order is critical: for each row k, first apply pouring from row k-1 (if exists), then apply spreading based on row k+1 (if exists), using the original input grid for spread checks to avoid over-modification.
 * Groups of 2's are strictly consecutive horizontal runs; isolated 2's or non-adjacent ones form separate groups, and spreading expands per group independently.
 * Edge cases include empty grids (return empty), single rows (no pour or spread), and boundaries (spreading clamps to grid edges with max(0, l-1) and min(m-1, r+1)).
 * Subtlety: spreading uses the *original* row for checking 7's to cap, not the post-pour version, preventing chained effects within the same row; also, pouring doesn't affect 2's or other numbers, only 7's under 6's.
 * No backward propagation: rules only flow downward (pour from above, spread from below), so top rows are minimally changed unless affected by later spreads (but spreads are applied after pour per row).
 * All numbers except 6,7,2 seem unchanged (e.g., if other values exist, they pass through), but based on examples, grids likely only contain these.
 * Horizontal spreading doesn't cross non-7's or propagate further; it's a one-time fill of 7's to 6's in the range per triggered group.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it successfully passed all 6 training examples, indicating core pouring and spreading mechanics are correctly implemented for those cases.
 * What worked: Vertical pouring correctly caps 7's under 6's from above; horizontal spreading accurately detects 2-groups below, checks for triggering 6's, and expands to adjacent original 7's without over-spreading or chaining.
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but the attempt lacks handling for potential non-uniform column lengths or other numbers (assumes all 6,7,2); get_2_groups is efficient but skips non-2 runs correctly.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant and build toward the main program; copy_grid prevents input mutation, which is essential.
 * Subtle success: Using original row in spread avoids double-modification, which likely matched training expectations.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 16x16 grid with patterns of 6's propagating downward and horizontally, such as repeated [7,7,6,...] in early rows transitioning to more 6's and 2's in later rows (e.g., row 4 has a block of 6's at the end, row 5 introduces 2's mixed with 6's and 7's).
 * It makes sense overall: early rows have minimal changes (consistent 6's in columns 2 and 12), suggesting no strong pouring from top; later rows show spreading effects like blocks of 6's (e.g., row 10: 6's in positions 3-5, row 11: 2's in 4-7 under prior 6's), and 2's appearing in output (untouched by rules, as expected).
 * However, it does not look fully correct without the input grid—repetitive top rows (first three identical) imply no pouring changes initially, but row 4's sudden 6-block at end (positions 10-15) and row 5's 2's suggest a trigger from below, yet without input, it's hard to verify if spreads are over- or under-applied (e.g., row 7 has isolated 2's at 8-11, which might not trigger if no overlapping 6 above).
 * Potential issue: Row 12 reverts some 6's to 7's in positions 4-7, which could be correct if no pour/spread hits them, but looks inconsistent with downward 6-propagation in column 5; this might indicate the program misses multi-group interactions or original 7 checks in complex tests.
 * The output demonstrates understanding (patterns align with rules), but subtle differences like uneven 2-placement (e.g., row 5 ends with five 2's, possibly a trigger for prior spreads) suggest it may not perfectly match expected if input has denser 2-clusters—unknown without input, but appears plausible for a test with staggered 2's and 7's.
