=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:52:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 16:03:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers (likely representing colors or pixel values) where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected "objects" (non-background components) by moving or repositioning them relative to a reference point or structure, possibly to align, complete, or mirror patterns while preserving background areas. The transformations appear to involve horizontal or vertical shifts based on special markers (e.g., rare values like 4), but the exact rules involve subtle alignment logic that the current program misapplies.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value (e.g., 1 in example 1, 8 in examples 2 and 3); non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * "Special" values are the least frequent non-background numbers (e.g., 4 in example 1), often marking centers or references for alignment; isolated special cells (no adjacent non-bg) serve as references for delta calculations.
 * Components with special cells should align horizontally or vertically to the reference (e.g., delta_c = ref_c - special_c if vertical stack, delta_r otherwise), but only if the component meets criteria like uniform column span or multi-cell length; otherwise, use average position for shift.
 * Components without special cells use centroid/average position (e.g., average column) for horizontal shifts relative to ref, with rounding; vertical shifts are rare and conditional.
 * Erase original component positions before placing shifted versions to avoid overlaps; out-of-bounds shifts are discarded.
 * Subtleties: Direction of shift depends on component shape (e.g., single-column vertical = horizontal shift; multi-cell horizontal = vertical shift); multiple similar components (e.g., repeated 8-blobs in example 1) must be processed independently without interfering; rare cases like diagonal or irregular shapes (e.g., example 2's scattered 3's) require precise connectivity to avoid merging unrelated parts.
 * Handle empty grids or all-background gracefully; process components in discovery order (row-major) to avoid order-dependent errors.
 * Easy to miss: Special cell in component may not be the "center"—use its position for delta, not average; components with exactly one column but >1 cell imply vertical alignment (delta_r); test for isolation correctly (only adjacent non-bg counts, not special itself).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or color changes, only translation; preserve object integrity (no splitting or reshaping); example 3 shows vertical mirroring or alignment of 1's and 2's across horizontal bands.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program uses a BFS-based queue (deque) for connected component extraction, which is helpful for identifying components and collecting their positions/values. Counter from collections is useful for frequency-based background/special detection.

```python
from collections import Counter, deque

def find_background_and_special(grid: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Identify background (most common) and special (least common non-bg with >0 count)."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0, 0  # Default for empty
    flat = [grid[i][j] for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[0]))]
    c = Counter(flat)
    background = c.most_common(1)[0][0]
    non_bg = [k for k in c if k != background and c[k] > 0]
    special = min(non_bg, key=lambda k: c[k]) if non_bg else None
    return background, special
```

```python
def extract_components(grid: List[List[int]], background: int, directions: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Extract all connected components (non-bg) using BFS, returning list of [positions with (r, c, value)]."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                component.append((i, j, grid[i][j]))
                while queue:
                    r, c = queue.popleft()
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            queue.append((nr, nc))
                            component.append((nr, nc, grid[nr][nc]))
                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def find_reference_special(grid: List[List[int]], special: int, background: int, directions: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Find first isolated special cell (no adjacent non-bg neighbors)."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == special:
                is_isolated = True
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] != background:
                        is_isolated = False
                        break
                if is_isolated:
                    return r, c
    return None, None
```

The delta calculation logic in the program is partially helpful but buggy (e.g., assumes delta_r=0 or delta_c=0 without shape checks); the visited matrix prevents reprocessing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt with the provided program; all three training examples failed (INCORRECT).
 * Train 1: Generated moved the bottom 8-blob's 4 correctly but misplaced the middle 8-blob's 4 (to column 5 instead of 4, and 8's shifted incorrectly); top and bottom 1-blobs with 4's were partially aligned but extra 8's lingered or shifted wrong (e.g., row 9 has 8,8,4 instead of 8,8,4 in expected but positions differ); unknown reason for incomplete erasure leading to overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated scattered 3's and 4's into irregular positions (e.g., row 2 has 3,3,8... instead of mostly 8's with structured 3's; row 4 has 3,3,4,8... but expected has clustered 3's in columns 4-6 and 9-11); 1's and 6's misplaced (e.g., 1 in row 4 col 0 instead of row 4 col 0 but with different neighbors); components merged or shifted in wrong direction, ignoring multi-part structures like the 3-chain.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated or misaligned 1-blobs across bands (e.g., rows 3-5 and 11-13 have similar 1,1,1 but expected varies: upper has 1,1,1 horizontal, lower has vertical 1's with 2 in center); 2's placed incorrectly (e.g., row 4 col 4=2 but expected row 12 col 4=2); vertical shifts applied wrongly, creating symmetric but incorrect patterns; failed to distinguish band-specific alignments.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (identifies blobs), but reference selection and delta logic fail (e.g., always horizontal bias, no shape-based direction choice); no handling for multi-special components or non-isolated refs; erasure before shift is done but overlaps occur if deltas overlap originals.
 * Function for average position (sum_c / n, round(ref_c - avg_c)) is helpful for non-special but misapplied to special cases.
 * Isolation check is correct but only finds first ref, missing cases with multiple isolated specials.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the hardcoded delta_r=0/delta_c=0 branches are broken for vertical components (don't use without shape checks like len(set(c for _,c,_ in component)) ==1 for vertical).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows partial shifts (e.g., upper 6/4 blob in rows 1-2 moved leftish but 4's are at (1,5),(1,6),(2,5-7) instead of preserved structure; lower 3/4 blob in rows 6-8 scattered with 2 misplaced at (5,6) and (12,6); isolated 2 at row 10 col 6 and 6 at row 8 col 9 remain but unaligned; overall, components like the 3/4/6 in rows 7-9 are fragmented (e.g., 3,2,3,4,4 instead of coherent shape), suggesting failed connectivity or wrong deltas—expected likely aligns all to a central reference (perhaps the isolated 2 or 6) into a symmetric or completed pattern without scattering, but hard to confirm without expected; missing erasure leaves background intrusions (e.g., row 3 has 8,8,6,8... but should be cleaner).

 * Erase original component positions before placing shifted versions to avoid overlaps; out-of-bounds shifts are discarded.
 * Subtleties: Direction of shift depends on component shape (e.g., single-column vertical = horizontal shift; multi-cell horizontal = vertical shift); multiple similar components (e.g., repeated 8-blobs in example 1) must be processed independently without interfering; rare cases like diagonal or irregular shapes (e.g., example 2's scattered 3's) require precise connectivity to avoid merging unrelated parts.
 * Handle empty grids or all-background gracefully; process components in discovery order (row-major) to avoid order-dependent errors.
 * Easy to miss: Special cell in component may not be the "center"—use its position for delta, not average; components with exactly one column but >1 cell imply vertical alignment (delta_r); test for isolation correctly (only adjacent non-bg counts, not special itself).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or color changes, only translation; preserve object integrity (no splitting or reshaping); example 3 shows vertical mirroring or alignment of 1's and 2's across horizontal bands.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program uses a BFS-based queue (deque) for connected component extraction, which is helpful for identifying components and collecting their positions/values. Counter from collections is useful for frequency-based background/special detection.

```python
from collections import Counter, deque

def find_background_and_special(grid: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Identify background (most common) and special (least common non-bg with >0 count)."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0, 0  # Default for empty
    flat = [grid[i][j] for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[0]))]
    c = Counter(flat)
    background = c.most_common(1)[0][0]
    non_bg = [k for k in c if k != background and c[k] > 0]
    special = min(non_bg, key=lambda k: c[k]) if non_bg else None
    return background, special
```

```python
def extract_components(grid: List[List[int]], background: int, directions: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Extract all connected components (non-bg) using BFS, returning list of [positions with (r, c, value)]."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                component.append((i, j, grid[i][j]))
                while queue:
                    r, c = queue.popleft()
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            queue.append((nr, nc))
                            component.append((nr, nc, grid[nr][nc]))
                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def find_reference_special(grid: List[List[int]], special: int, background: int, directions: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Find first isolated special cell (no adjacent non-bg neighbors)."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == special:
                is_isolated = True
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] != background:
                        is_isolated = False
                        break
                if is_isolated:
                    return r, c
    return None, None
```

The delta calculation logic in the program is partially helpful but buggy (e.g., assumes delta_r=0 or delta_c=0 without shape checks); the visited matrix prevents reprocessing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt with the provided program; all three training examples failed (INCORRECT).
 * Train 1: Generated moved the bottom 8-blob's 4 correctly but misplaced the middle 8-blob's 4 (to column 5 instead of 4, and 8's shifted incorrectly); top and bottom 1-blobs with 4's were partially aligned but extra 8's lingered or shifted wrong (e.g., row 9 has 8,8,4 instead of 8,8,4 in expected but positions differ); unknown reason for incomplete erasure leading to overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated scattered 3's and 4's into irregular positions (e.g., row 2 has 3,3,8... instead of mostly 8's with structured 3's; row 4 has 3,3,4,8... but expected has clustered 3's in columns 4-6 and 9-11); 1's and 6's misplaced (e.g., 1 in row 4 col 0 instead of row 4 col 0 but with different neighbors); components merged or shifted in wrong direction, ignoring multi-part structures like the 3-chain.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated or misaligned 1-blobs across bands (e.g., rows 3-5 and 11-13 have similar 1,1,1 but expected varies: upper has 1,1,1 horizontal, lower has vertical 1's with 2 in center); 2's placed incorrectly (e.g., row 4 col 4=2 but expected row 12 col 4=2); vertical shifts applied wrongly, creating symmetric but incorrect patterns; failed to distinguish band-specific alignments.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (identifies blobs), but reference selection and delta logic fail (e.g., always horizontal bias, no shape-based direction choice); no handling for multi-special components or non-isolated refs; erasure before shift is done but overlaps occur if deltas overlap originals.
 * Function for average position (sum_c / n, round(ref_c - avg_c)) is helpful for non-special but misapplied to special cases.
 * Isolation check is correct but only finds first ref, missing cases with multiple isolated specials.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the hardcoded delta_r=0/delta_c=0 branches are broken for vertical components (don't use without shape checks like len(set(c for _,c,_ in component)) ==1 for vertical).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows partial shifts (e.g., upper 6/4 blob in rows 1-2 moved leftish but 4's are at (1,5),(1,6),(2,5-7) instead of preserved structure; lower 3/4 blob in rows 6-8 scattered with 2 misplaced at (5,6) and (12,6); isolated 2 at row 10 col 6 and 6 at row 8 col 9 remain but unaligned; overall, components like the 3/4/6 in rows 7-9 are fragmented (e.g., 3,2,3,4,4 instead of coherent shape), suggesting failed connectivity or wrong deltas—expected likely aligns all to a central reference (perhaps the isolated 2 or 6) into a symmetric or completed pattern without scattering, but hard to confirm without expected; missing erasure leaves background intrusions (e.g., row 3 has 8,8,6,8... but should be cleaner).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 16:17:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify and manipulate "objects" (connected groups of non-background cells) by shifting them horizontally to align based on rare "special" markers, effectively correcting misaligned shapes or symbols while preserving the background and erasing originals. The process identifies background as the dominant value, specials as the rarest non-background, extracts 4-connected components, computes reference positions from isolated specials, and shifts components containing specials to align their special cells' average column to the reference.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in examples); ignore it for connectivity.
 * Special is the least frequent non-background value with at least one occurrence; if none, return grid unchanged.
 * Connected components use 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * Isolated specials are single special cells with no adjacent non-background neighbors (including other specials); their average column sets the reference for alignment.
 * If no isolated specials, fall back to average column of all special cells as reference.
 * For each component containing at least one special: compute average column of its special cells, calculate delta_c as (ref_c - avg_component_c) rounded, shift entire component horizontally by delta_c (no vertical shift), erase original positions to background, and place shifted values only if within bounds (overwriting if needed).
 * Skip shifting for isolated single-cell components (to avoid moving lone markers).
 * Components without specials are left untouched.
 * Grids are rectangular; handle empty or single-row cases gracefully.
 * Subtle: Multiple specials per component require averaging their columns; rounding delta_c can cause minor misalignments if averages are fractional.
 * Subtle: Overlapping after shift may occur but is allowed (new values overwrite); out-of-bounds shifts are discarded.
 * Subtle: If specials are vertically spread, horizontal-only shift assumes alignment is purely columnar.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns; ensure full extraction before shifting.
 * Easy to miss: Reference uses isolated specials preferentially, as they act as "anchors" not part of larger objects.
 * All values are integers; preserve original values during shift, don't modify them.
 * Potential edge: If all non-bg are specials or isolated, minimal changes; if no specials, no action.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 3, successfully extracting components, identifying specials (e.g., likely 1 as special), computing reference columns from isolated specials, and shifting components horizontally to align, resulting in properly reformed shapes.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output shows incomplete or misaligned shifting—e.g., a vertical "4" stack on left remains partially unshifted/misplaced, "3" blobs are fragmented and not aligned to form coherent shapes (like the expected horizontal "3" lines and integrated "1"s), and bottom "6"s are absent or wrong; expected has reorganized "3" and "1" into a structured pattern with "4" and "6" in specific positions, but generated leaves artifacts like stray "3"s and "1" in wrong rows/columns, suggesting faulty delta_c calculation for multi-special components or failure to erase/overwrite properly (e.g., original positions not fully bg-filled, or shifts overlapping incorrectly).
 * extract_components is essential and correct for identifying objects via BFS.
 * find_all_isolated_special is helpful for reference but may underperform if isolation check misses edge cases (e.g., specials adjacent diagonally, but code correctly uses 4-dir).
 * find_background_and_special is solid but assumes special exists; fallback to None is handled but untested in examples.
 * The main program logic is mostly sound for simple cases (train 1/3) but breaks on complex layouts with multiple overlapping-potential components (train 2), possibly due to averaging specials per component ignoring vertical distribution or rounding errors in delta_c.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, though the shifting loop could be refined to handle per-component ref if isolated specials are component-specific (but current global ref works for train 1/3).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes for unknown reasons—possibly the code shifts only components with specials but leaves non-special parts (like some "3"s or "4"s) unaligned, or miscomputes ref_c from non-isolated specials.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or misaligned in spots: It shows some horizontal shifts (e.g., top "6"s moved right, mid "4"s and "3"s consolidated into lines, bottom "2"s isolated), which aligns with the puzzle's shifting rule and preserves values/background (8). However, it does not fully match an expected "corrected" puzzle—e.g., the "2" at (3,6) and (11,12) seem untouched or minimally shifted but may need alignment to specials (assuming 1 or rarest like 1 isn't visible, but grid has 2,3,4,6; special likely 1 if present, else 2); "3" blob on right seems shifted left but leaves gaps (e.g., row 7 col 18-20 has "3,8,3" instead of full alignment); vertical "4"s in cols 3-4 are partially reformed but stray "4"s remain (e.g., row 5 col 4); overall, it looks like partial object realignment (e.g., "6"s grouped better) but with artifacts like un-erased originals or wrong delta (e.g., "2" at bottom not centralized), suggesting the code handles simple shifts but fails multi-component interactions similar to train 2. Without expected output, it makes sense as an attempt but not fully correct—missing full erasure in dense areas and potential vertical considerations (though puzzle is horizontal-only).

[2025-10-01 16:17:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers (likely representing colors or pixel values) where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected "objects" (non-background components) by moving or repositioning them relative to a reference point or structure, possibly to align, complete, or mirror patterns while preserving background areas. The transformations appear to involve horizontal or vertical shifts based on special markers (e.g., rare values like 4), but the exact rules involve subtle alignment logic that the current program misapplies.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value (e.g., 1 in example 1, 8 in examples 2 and 3); non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * "Special" values are the least frequent non-background numbers (e.g., 4 in example 1), often marking centers or references for alignment; isolated special cells (no adjacent non-bg) serve as references for delta calculations.
 * Components with special cells should align horizontally or vertically to the reference (e.g., delta_c = ref_c - special_c if vertical stack, delta_r otherwise), but only if the component meets criteria like uniform column span or multi-cell length; otherwise, use average position for shift.
 * Components without special cells use centroid/average position (e.g., average column) for horizontal shifts relative to ref, with rounding; vertical shifts are rare and conditional.
 * Erase original component positions before placing shifted versions to avoid overlaps; out-of-bounds shifts are discarded.
 * Subtleties: Direction of shift depends on component shape (e.g., single-column vertical = horizontal shift; multi-cell horizontal = vertical shift); multiple similar components (e.g., repeated 8-blobs in example 1) must be processed independently without interfering; rare cases like diagonal or irregular shapes (e.g., example 2's scattered 3's) require precise connectivity to avoid merging unrelated parts.
 * Handle empty grids or all-background gracefully; process components in discovery order (row-major) to avoid order-dependent errors.
 * Easy to miss: Special cell in component may not be the "center"—use its position for delta, not average; components with exactly one column but >1 cell imply vertical alignment (delta_r); test for isolation correctly (only adjacent non-bg counts, not special itself).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or color changes, only translation; preserve object integrity (no splitting or reshaping); example 3 shows vertical mirroring or alignment of 1's and 2's across horizontal bands.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program uses a BFS-based queue (deque) for connected component extraction, which is helpful for identifying components and collecting their positions/values. Counter from collections is useful for frequency-based background/special detection.

```python
from collections import Counter, deque

def find_background_and_special(grid: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Identify background (most common) and special (least common non-bg with >0 count)."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0, 0  # Default for empty
    flat = [grid[i][j] for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[0]))]
    c = Counter(flat)
    background = c.most_common(1)[0][0]
    non_bg = [k for k in c if k != background and c[k] > 0]
    special = min(non_bg, key=lambda k: c[k]) if non_bg else None
    return background, special
```

```python
def extract_components(grid: List[List[int]], background: int, directions: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Extract all connected components (non-bg) using BFS, returning list of [positions with (r, c, value)]."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                component.append((i, j, grid[i][j]))
                while queue:
                    r, c = queue.popleft()
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            queue.append((nr, nc))
                            component.append((nr, nc, grid[nr][nc]))
                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def find_reference_special(grid: List[List[int]], special: int, background: int, directions: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Find first isolated special cell (no adjacent non-bg neighbors)."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == special:
                is_isolated = True
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] != background:
                        is_isolated = False
                        break
                if is_isolated:
                    return r, c
    return None, None
```

The delta calculation logic in the program is partially helpful but buggy (e.g., assumes delta_r=0 or delta_c=0 without shape checks); the visited matrix prevents reprocessing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt with the provided program; all three training examples failed (INCORRECT).
 * Train 1: Generated moved the bottom 8-blob's 4 correctly but misplaced the middle 8-blob's 4 (to column 5 instead of 4, and 8's shifted incorrectly); top and bottom 1-blobs with 4's were partially aligned but extra 8's lingered or shifted wrong (e.g., row 9 has 8,8,4 instead of 8,8,4 in expected but positions differ); unknown reason for incomplete erasure leading to overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated scattered 3's and 4's into irregular positions (e.g., row 2 has 3,3,8... instead of mostly 8's with structured 3's; row 4 has 3,3,4,8... but expected has clustered 3's in columns 4-6 and 9-11); 1's and 6's misplaced (e.g., 1 in row 4 col 0 instead of row 4 col 0 but with different neighbors); components merged or shifted in wrong direction, ignoring multi-part structures like the 3-chain.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated or misaligned 1-blobs across bands (e.g., rows 3-5 and 11-13 have similar 1,1,1 but expected varies: upper has 1,1,1 horizontal, lower has vertical 1's with 2 in center); 2's placed incorrectly (e.g., row 4 col 4=2 but expected row 12 col 4=2); vertical shifts applied wrongly, creating symmetric but incorrect patterns; failed to distinguish band-specific alignments.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (identifies blobs), but reference selection and delta logic fail (e.g., always horizontal bias, no shape-based direction choice); no handling for multi-special components or non-isolated refs; erasure before shift is done but overlaps occur if deltas overlap originals.
 * Function for average position (sum_c / n, round(ref_c - avg_c)) is helpful for non-special but misapplied to special cases.
 * Isolation check is correct but only finds first ref, missing cases with multiple isolated specials.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the hardcoded delta_r=0/delta_c=0 branches are broken for vertical components (don't use without shape checks like len(set(c for _,c,_ in component)) ==1 for vertical).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows partial shifts (e.g., upper 6/4 blob in rows 1-2 moved leftish but 4's are at (1,5),(1,6),(2,5-7) instead of preserved structure; lower 3/4 blob in rows 6-8 scattered with 2 misplaced at (5,6) and (12,6); isolated 2 at row 10 col 6 and 6 at row 8 col 9 remain but unaligned; overall, components like the 3/4/6 in rows 7-9 are fragmented (e.g., 3,2,3,4,4 instead of coherent shape), suggesting failed connectivity or wrong deltas—expected likely aligns all to a central reference (perhaps the isolated 2 or 6) into a symmetric or completed pattern without scattering, but hard to confirm without expected; missing erasure leaves background intrusions (e.g., row 3 has 8,8,6,8... but should be cleaner).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify and manipulate "objects" (connected groups of non-background cells) by shifting them horizontally to align based on rare "special" markers, effectively correcting misaligned shapes or symbols while preserving the background and erasing originals. The process identifies background as the dominant value, specials as the rarest non-background, extracts 4-connected components, computes reference positions from isolated specials, and shifts components containing specials to align their special cells' average column to the reference.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in examples); ignore it for connectivity.
 * Special is the least frequent non-background value with at least one occurrence; if none, return grid unchanged.
 * Connected components use 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * Isolated specials are single special cells with no adjacent non-background neighbors (including other specials); their average column sets the reference for alignment.
 * If no isolated specials, fall back to average column of all special cells as reference.
 * For each component containing at least one special: compute average column of its special cells, calculate delta_c as (ref_c - avg_component_c) rounded, shift entire component horizontally by delta_c (no vertical shift), erase original positions to background, and place shifted values only if within bounds (overwriting if needed).
 * Skip shifting for isolated single-cell components (to avoid moving lone markers).
 * Components without specials are left untouched.
 * Grids are rectangular; handle empty or single-row cases gracefully.
 * Subtle: Multiple specials per component require averaging their columns; rounding delta_c can cause minor misalignments if averages are fractional.
 * Subtle: Overlapping after shift may occur but is allowed (new values overwrite); out-of-bounds shifts are discarded.
 * Subtle: If specials are vertically spread, horizontal-only shift assumes alignment is purely columnar.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns; ensure full extraction before shifting.
 * Easy to miss: Reference uses isolated specials preferentially, as they act as "anchors" not part of larger objects.
 * All values are integers; preserve original values during shift, don't modify them.
 * Potential edge: If all non-bg are specials or isolated, minimal changes; if no specials, no action.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 16:31:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the goal is to identify a background color, extract connected components (objects) of non-background cells, preserve isolated "reference" cells, and shift larger components based on alignments with special values or keys, effectively repositioning shapes while maintaining their internal structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in the test output), and all components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Isolated single-cell components (len==1) are treated as "special values" or references and remain in place unshifted; they serve as alignment points for shifting larger components.
 * For larger components (>1 cell), identify "special_v" as the minimum special value that appears the least frequently within the component; compute its centroid (average row/col position) and compare to the centroid of its references to derive a shift delta (dr, dc).
 * Shifts are primarily horizontal or vertical: if references are on a grid edge (col 0 or cols-1), shift vertically (dr) and possibly a special -1 dc if spans are square and key is above ref; otherwise, shift horizontally (dc).
 * New grid starts filled with background; isolated cells are placed directly, larger components are shifted but clipped to grid bounds (out-of-bounds cells are dropped without wrapping).
 * Components do not overlap after shifting; if they would, the program overwrites with the last-placed value, but this may not occur in valid puzzles.
 * Subtlety: Special values are only from isolated cells; a component's "key" is its internal positions of the selected special_v, not the full component shape.
 * Centroids use floating-point averages then round for ref_c; min count for special_v selection ensures rare/special markers drive the shift.
 * Easy to miss: No rotation or scaling; shapes preserve orientation and relative positions exactly. Background extraction assumes uniform bg, but edge cases with empty grid return 0. Visited matrix prevents re-processing cells.
 * All non-bg cells must be part of some component; no floating single cells post-shift unless isolated.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed program provided; no prior attempts to summarize, but it builds on component extraction and shifting logic.
 * Worked: Correctly handles background detection, 4-connected extraction, isolated refs, and basic centroid-based shifts for training examples 1-3 (all passed).
 * Did not work (inferred from structure): Shift logic may over-rely on min special_v and edge detection, potentially misaligning non-edge or multi-ref cases; the special -1 dc condition (square span and key above ref) might be too specific or incorrect for some shapes.
 * Component extraction is essential and correct (BFS with visited prevents leaks); Counter for frequencies is key for identifying rare specials.
 * get_refs_and_specials correctly isolates singles but assumes all specials are from len==1; misses if specials appear in larger comps without isolates.
 * Delta computation uses averages (good for centroids) but rounds only ref_c and dr/dc, which could cause off-by-1 shifts in uneven distributions.
 * No issues with omitting components or shape mismatches in training, but unknown if training had square spans or edge refs.
 * The main program integrates well but places isolates first then overwrites with shifted larges, which could erase refs if shifts overlap (potential bug if refs are not preserved).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 14x20 grid (inferred from 14 lines of 20 values each) dominated by 8s (likely bg), with scattered non-8s like 4s, 3s, 6s, 2s forming partial shapes (e.g., row 0 has 4s clustered, row 2 has 4s, row 3 has mixed 6/2/4/3, etc.).
 * It looks partially correct: Preserves isolated-like placements (e.g., single 2s, 3s) and shifts clusters (e.g., 4s in rows 0-2 seem shifted right/down from potential original), but some components appear fragmented or unshifted (e.g., bottom 2s in row 12 cols 0 and 19 might be refs, but 6s in row 10-11 don't align cleanly with refs).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should have cleaner alignments (e.g., all 4-clusters shifted to match ref positions without leftovers), but here row 3 has overlapping 6/4/3 that suggest incomplete shift or wrong delta (e.g., vertical shift missed for edge refs); 3s in rows 0-3 seem partially shifted left but leave trails of 8s where full shape should be. It's different from expected because shapes like the 4-block in rows 0-2/cols 3-5 is intact but nearby 4s in row 2 cols 8-10 and row 5 col 10-13 indicate multiple components shifted independently, possibly with wrong special_v selection (min rare value) causing misdeltas. Unknown why 2s are at edges without corresponding shifts, but it mismatches if puzzle requires all larges to align perfectly to refs.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on a direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of only those interactions, connections, or effects between elements/properties that are **obvious and consistent across EVERY train example** (i.e., present in train 1, 2, and 3 without exception). I focused solely on patterns that hold universally, ignoring any high-level puzzle solution, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., unchanged background bbox alone), or inconsistent behaviors (e.g., y-position shifts occur in train 2 but not 1 or 3, so y-transformation is called out as unknown rather than explained). No forced connections are included—only those derivable directly from matching components by color, pixels, and bbox across inputs/outputs. Components are considered "interconnected" if one property of one clearly affects or relates to another in a repeatable way (e.g., position influencing containment).

- **Color preservation across components**: Every component's color is preserved from input to output (e.g., all Maroon components remain Maroon, all Yellow remain Yellow, etc., with no color shifts or new colors introduced). This indicates no interaction between colors themselves, but connects individual component identity to the overall transformation rule—components do not change "type" via color, ensuring consistent tracking of elements like small accents (Yellow/Red/Pink) relative to primaries (Maroon/Blue/Green).

- **Pixel count preservation within components**: Each component's exact pixel count remains identical from input to output (e.g., a 1-pixel Yellow stays 1 pixel; a 9-pixel Maroon stays 9 pixels; totals per color match exactly, like 4 pixels of Blue in train 2). This connects the intrinsic "size" property of a component to its movement/transformation, implying rigid preservation of shape/silhouette without splitting, merging, or resizing—any position or bbox changes affect placement but not mass (pixels).

- **Small 1-pixel components interact with larger components via position-based containment/adjacency**: All 1-pixel components (e.g., Yellow/Red/Pink/Blue/Green/Maroon singles) are repositioned (x primarily, sometimes y) in the output to be contained within or directly adjacent to a larger same-y-level component's bbox (pixels >1), forming "inner" or "accent" relationships. This is consistent:
  - Train 1: 1-pixel Yellows/Blues/Maroons (e.g., [2,4] Yellow) moved inside/adjacent to larger Maroons (e.g., [1,3,3,4] → [4,3,6,4]).
  - Train 2: 1-pixel Pinks/Blues/Greens (e.g., [2,6] Pink → [2,8]; [10,3] Blue → [9,4]) placed inside/adjacent to larger Greens/Yellows (e.g., within [4,1,6,4] Green or next to [2,4,2,7] Yellow).
  - Train 3: 1-pixel Reds/Blues (e.g., [2,5] Red → [4,5]; [5,18] Blue → [4,18]) placed inside/adjacent to larger Blues (e.g., within [3,3,5,4] or [2,16,6,17]).
  The interaction is driven by input position (scattered) affecting output position (aligned relative to larger bbox), creating structured "assemblies" without changing pixels or color. No such containment for isolated 1-pixels without a nearby larger component.

- **Larger component (>1 pixel, holes=0) position interacts with small component placement**: The x-position (and sometimes width) of larger foreground components (e.g., multi-pixel Maroon/Blue/Green/Yellow) is adjusted leftward or centralized, which directly effects where small 1-pixel components are placed relative to them (as above). This holds consistently:
  - Train 1: Larger Maroons (e.g., [1,13,3,16] → [4,13,6,16], x shifted right but overall left-aligned in canvas) attract nearby small Yellows/Blues into their bbox.
  - Train 2: Larger Greens/Yellows (e.g., [4,4,6,7] → [4,1,6,4], x stable but y up) draw in small Maroons/Blues/Pinks.
  - Train 3: Larger Blues/Greens (e.g., [3,10,7,12] → [1,10,5,12], x narrowed/left) incorporate small Reds/Greens.
  The effect is positional: Input scattering leads to output clustering, where larger bbox expansion/contraction (x only in trains 1/3; unknown y in train 2) defines "boundaries" for small elements. Height (y2-y1) often preserved, connecting shape properties to movement constraints.

- **Holes property in background connects to small same-color components (limited consistency)**: The background component's holes (large bbox, high pixels) remains unchanged in bbox/pixels/color, but its hole count interacts with small same-color foreground components only when they are repositioned "into" it—decreasing holes by 1 per moved small element (observed in train 1: Blue bg holes 3→2 with 1 small Blue moved from [2,15]→[5,15], possibly filling). In trains 2/3, no hole change despite small same-color moves (e.g., no Green hole decrease in train 3 despite Green small repositioned), so this interaction is partial/unknown (may depend on unobservable overlap or specific color matching not consistent across all).

No other obvious consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no universal color-to-movement rule, as alignments vary by canvas width; no consistent hole effects for non-background; y-position changes are sporadic and unexplained). Irrelevant elements (e.g., fully unchanged single components like [4,0] Red in train 3) were excluded, as they show no interaction. This list applies directly to analyzing test inputs, where similar preservations and small-to-large positional effects should be checked.

[2025-10-01 16:34:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers (likely representing colors or pixel values) where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected "objects" (non-background components) by moving or repositioning them relative to a reference point or structure, possibly to align, complete, or mirror patterns while preserving background areas. The transformations appear to involve horizontal or vertical shifts based on special markers (e.g., rare values like 4), but the exact rules involve subtle alignment logic that the current program misapplies.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value (e.g., 1 in example 1, 8 in examples 2 and 3); non-background cells form 4-connected components (up, down, left, right adjacency).
 * "Special" values are the least frequent non-background numbers (e.g., 4 in example 1), often marking centers or references for alignment; isolated special cells (no adjacent non-bg) serve as references for delta calculations.
 * Components with special cells should align horizontally or vertically to the reference (e.g., delta_c = ref_c - special_c if vertical stack, delta_r otherwise), but only if the component meets criteria like uniform column span or multi-cell length; otherwise, use average position for shift.
 * Components without special cells use centroid/average position (e.g., average column) for horizontal shifts relative to ref, with rounding; vertical shifts are rare and conditional.
 * Erase original component positions before placing shifted versions to avoid overlaps; out-of-bounds shifts are discarded.
 * Subtleties: Direction of shift depends on component shape (e.g., single-column vertical = horizontal shift; multi-cell horizontal = vertical shift); multiple similar components (e.g., repeated 8-blobs in example 1) must be processed independently without interfering; rare cases like diagonal or irregular shapes (e.g., example 2's scattered 3's) require precise connectivity to avoid merging unrelated parts.
 * Handle empty grids or all-background gracefully; process components in discovery order (row-major) to avoid order-dependent errors.
 * Easy to miss: Special cell in component may not be the "center"—use its position for delta, not average; components with exactly one column but >1 cell imply vertical alignment (delta_r); test for isolation correctly (only adjacent non-bg counts, not special itself).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or color changes, only translation; preserve object integrity (no splitting or reshaping); example 3 shows vertical mirroring or alignment of 1's and 2's across horizontal bands.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current program uses a BFS-based queue (deque) for connected component extraction, which is helpful for identifying components and collecting their positions/values. Counter from collections is useful for frequency-based background/special detection.

```python
from collections import Counter, deque

def find_background_and_special(grid: List[List[int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Identify background (most common) and special (least common non-bg with >0 count)."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0, 0  # Default for empty
    flat = [grid[i][j] for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[0]))]
    c = Counter(flat)
    background = c.most_common(1)[0][0]
    non_bg = [k for k in c if k != background and c[k] > 0]
    special = min(non_bg, key=lambda k: c[k]) if non_bg else None
    return background, special
```

```python
def extract_components(grid: List[List[int]], background: int, directions: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Extract all connected components (non-bg) using BFS, returning list of [positions with (r, c, value)]."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != background and not visited[i][j]:
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                component.append((i, j, grid[i][j]))
                while queue:
                    r, c = queue.popleft()
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc] != background:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            queue.append((nr, nc))
                            component.append((nr, nc, grid[nr][nc]))
                if component:
                    components.append(component)
    return components
```

```python
def find_reference_special(grid: List[List[int]], special: int, background: int, directions: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Find first isolated special cell (no adjacent non-bg neighbors)."""
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == special:
                is_isolated = True
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] != background:
                        is_isolated = False
                        break
                if is_isolated:
                    return r, c
    return None, None
```

The delta calculation logic in the program is partially helpful but buggy (e.g., assumes delta_r=0 or delta_c=0 without shape checks); the visited matrix prevents reprocessing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt with the provided program; all three training examples failed (INCORRECT).
 * Train 1: Generated moved the bottom 8-blob's 4 correctly but misplaced the middle 8-blob's 4 (to column 5 instead of 4, and 8's shifted incorrectly); top and bottom 1-blobs with 4's were partially aligned but extra 8's lingered or shifted wrong (e.g., row 9 has 8,8,4 instead of 8,8,4 in expected but positions differ); unknown reason for incomplete erasure leading to overlaps.
 * Train 2: Generated scattered 3's and 4's into irregular positions (e.g., row 2 has 3,3,8... instead of mostly 8's with structured 3's; row 4 has 3,3,4,8... but expected has clustered 3's in columns 4-6 and 9-11); 1's and 6's misplaced (e.g., 1 in row 4 col 0 instead of row 4 col 0 but with different neighbors); components merged or shifted in wrong direction, ignoring multi-part structures like the 3-chain.
 * Train 3: Generated duplicated or misaligned 1-blobs across bands (e.g., rows 3-5 and 11-13 have similar 1,1,1 but expected varies: upper has 1,1,1 horizontal, lower has vertical 1's with 2 in center); 2's placed incorrectly (e.g., row 4 col 4=2 but expected row 12 col 4=2); vertical shifts applied wrongly, creating symmetric but incorrect patterns; failed to distinguish band-specific alignments.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (identifies blobs), but reference selection and delta logic fail (e.g., always horizontal bias, no shape-based direction choice); no handling for multi-special components or non-isolated refs; erasure before shift is done but overlaps occur if deltas overlap originals.
 * Function for average position (sum_c / n, round(ref_c - avg_c)) is helpful for non-special but misapplied to special cases.
 * Isolation check is correct but only finds first ref, missing cases with multiple isolated specials.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the hardcoded delta_r=0/delta_c=0 branches are broken for vertical components (don't use without shape checks like len(set(c for _,c,_ in component)) ==1 for vertical).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows partial shifts (e.g., upper 6/4 blob in rows 1-2 moved leftish but 4's are at (1,5),(1,6),(2,5-7) instead of preserved structure; lower 3/4 blob in rows 6-8 scattered with 2 misplaced at (5,6) and (12,6); isolated 2 at row 10 col 6 and 6 at row 8 col 9 remain but unaligned; overall, components like the 3/4/6 in rows 7-9 are fragmented (e.g., 3,2,3,4,4 instead of coherent shape), suggesting failed connectivity or wrong deltas—expected likely aligns all to a central reference (perhaps the isolated 2 or 6) into a symmetric or completed pattern without scattering, but hard to confirm without expected; missing erasure leaves background intrusions (e.g., row 3 has 8,8,6,8... but should be cleaner).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify and manipulate "objects" (connected groups of non-background cells) by shifting them horizontally to align based on rare "special" markers, effectively correcting misaligned shapes or symbols while preserving the background and erasing originals. The process identifies background as the dominant value, specials as the rarest non-background, extracts 4-connected components, computes reference positions from isolated specials, and shifts components containing specials to align their special cells' average column to the reference.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in examples); ignore it for connectivity.
 * Special is the least frequent non-background value with at least one occurrence; if none, return grid unchanged.
 * Connected components use 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right); diagonals do not count.
 * Isolated specials are single special cells with no adjacent non-background neighbors (including other specials); their average column sets the reference for alignment.
 * If no isolated specials, fall back to average column of all special cells as reference.
 * For each component containing at least one special: compute average column of its special cells, calculate delta_c as (ref_c - avg_component_c) rounded, shift entire component horizontally by delta_c (no vertical shift), erase original positions to background, and place shifted values only if within bounds (overwriting if needed).
 * Skip shifting for isolated single-cell components (to avoid moving lone markers).
 * Components without specials are left untouched.
 * Grids are rectangular; handle empty or single-row cases gracefully.
 * Subtle: Multiple specials per component require averaging their columns; rounding delta_c can cause minor misalignments if averages are fractional.
 * Subtle: Overlapping after shift may occur but is allowed (new values overwrite); out-of-bounds shifts are discarded.
 * Subtle: If specials are vertically spread, horizontal-only shift assumes alignment is purely columnar.
 * Easy to miss: Components may span multiple rows/columns; ensure full extraction before shifting.
 * Easy to miss: Reference uses isolated specials preferentially, as they act as "anchors" not part of larger objects.
 * All values are integers; preserve original values during shift, don't modify them.
 * Potential edge: If all non-bg are specials or isolated, minimal changes; if no specials, no action.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 3, successfully extracting components, identifying specials (e.g., likely 1 as special), computing reference columns from isolated specials, and shifting components horizontally to align, resulting in properly reformed shapes.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output shows incomplete or misaligned shifting—e.g., a vertical "4" stack on left remains partially unshifted/misplaced, "3" blobs are fragmented and not aligned to form coherent shapes (like the expected horizontal "3" lines and integrated "1"s), and bottom "6"s are absent or wrong; expected has reorganized "3" and "1" into a structured pattern with "4" and "6" in specific positions, but generated leaves artifacts like stray "3"s and "1" in wrong rows/columns, suggesting faulty delta_c calculation for multi-special components or failure to erase/overwrite properly (e.g., original positions not fully bg-filled, or shifts overlapping incorrectly).
 * extract_components is essential and correct for identifying objects via BFS.
 * find_all_isolated_special is helpful for reference but may underperform if isolation check misses edge cases (e.g., specials adjacent diagonally, but code correctly uses 4-dir).
 * find_background_and_special is solid but assumes special exists; fallback to None is handled but untested in examples.
 * The main program logic is mostly sound for simple cases (train 1/3) but breaks on complex layouts with multiple overlapping-potential components (train 2), possibly due to averaging specials per component ignoring vertical distribution or rounding errors in delta_c.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, though the shifting loop could be refined to handle per-component ref if isolated specials are component-specific (but current global ref works for train 1/3).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes for unknown reasons—possibly the code shifts only components with specials but leaves non-special parts (like some "3"s or "4"s) unaligned, or miscomputes ref_c from non-isolated specials.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or misaligned in spots: It shows some horizontal shifts (e.g., top "6"s moved right, mid "4"s and "3"s consolidated into lines, bottom "2"s isolated), which aligns with the puzzle's shifting rule and preserves values/background (8). However, it does not fully match an expected "corrected" puzzle—e.g., the "2" at (3,6) and (11,12) seem untouched or minimally shifted but may need alignment to specials (assuming 1 or rarest like 1 isn't visible, but grid has 2,3,4,6; special likely 1 if present, else 2); "3" blob on right seems shifted left but leaves gaps (e.g., row 7 col 18-20 has "3,8,3" instead of full alignment); vertical "4"s in cols 3-4 are partially reformed but stray "4"s remain (e.g., row 5 col 4); overall, it looks like partial object realignment (e.g., "6"s grouped better) but with artifacts like un-erased originals or wrong delta (e.g., "2" at bottom not centralized), suggesting the code handles simple shifts but fails multi-component interactions similar to train 2. Without expected output, it makes sense as an attempt but not fully correct—missing full erasure in dense areas and potential vertical considerations (though puzzle is horizontal-only).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where the goal is to identify a background color, extract connected components (objects) of non-background cells, preserve isolated "reference" cells, and shift larger components based on alignments with special values or keys, effectively repositioning shapes while maintaining their internal structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in the test output), and all components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Isolated single-cell components (len==1) are treated as "special values" or references and remain in place unshifted; they serve as alignment points for shifting larger components.
 * For larger components (>1 cell), identify "special_v" as the minimum special value that appears the least frequently within the component; compute its centroid (average row/col position) and compare to the centroid of its references to derive a shift delta (dr, dc).
 * Shifts are primarily horizontal or vertical: if references are on a grid edge (col 0 or cols-1), shift vertically (dr) and possibly a special -1 dc if spans are square and key is above ref; otherwise, shift horizontally (dc).
 * New grid starts filled with background; isolated cells are placed directly, larger components are shifted but clipped to grid bounds (out-of-bounds cells are dropped without wrapping).
 * Components do not overlap after shifting; if they would, the program overwrites with the last-placed value, but this may not occur in valid puzzles.
 * Subtlety: Special values are only from isolated cells; a component's "key" is its internal positions of the selected special_v, not the full component shape.
 * Centroids use floating-point averages then round for ref_c; min count for special_v selection ensures rare/special markers drive the shift.
 * Easy to miss: No rotation or scaling; shapes preserve orientation and relative positions exactly. Background extraction assumes uniform bg, but edge cases with empty grid return 0. Visited matrix prevents re-processing cells.
 * All non-bg cells must be part of some component; no floating single cells post-shift unless isolated.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed program provided; no prior attempts to summarize, but it builds on component extraction and shifting logic.
 * Worked: Correctly handles background detection, 4-connected extraction, isolated refs, and basic centroid-based shifts for training examples 1-3 (all passed).
 * Did not work (inferred from structure): Shift logic may over-rely on min special_v and edge detection, potentially misaligning non-edge or multi-ref cases; the special -1 dc condition (square span and key above ref) might be too specific or incorrect for some shapes.
 * Component extraction is essential and correct (BFS with visited prevents leaks); Counter for frequencies is key for identifying rare specials.
 * get_refs_and_specials correctly isolates singles but assumes all specials are from len==1; misses if specials appear in larger comps without isolates.
 * Delta computation uses averages (good for centroids) but rounds only ref_c and dr/dc, which could cause off-by-1 shifts in uneven distributions.
 * No issues with omitting components or shape mismatches in training, but unknown if training had square spans or edge refs.
 * The main program integrates well but places isolates first then overwrites with shifted larges, which could erase refs if shifts overlap (potential bug if refs are not preserved).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 14x20 grid (inferred from 14 lines of 20 values each) dominated by 8s (likely bg), with scattered non-8s like 4s, 3s, 6s, 2s forming partial shapes (e.g., row 0 has 4s clustered, row 2 has 4s, row 3 has mixed 6/2/4/3, etc.).
 * It looks partially correct: Preserves isolated-like placements (e.g., single 2s, 3s) and shifts clusters (e.g., 4s in rows 0-2 seem shifted right/down from potential original), but some components appear fragmented or unshifted (e.g., bottom 2s in row 12 cols 0 and 19 might be refs, but 6s in row 10-11 don't align cleanly with refs).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should have cleaner alignments (e.g., all 4-clusters shifted to match ref positions without leftovers), but here row 3 has overlapping 6/4/3 that suggest incomplete shift or wrong delta (e.g., vertical shift missed for edge refs); 3s in rows 0-3 seem partially shifted left but leave trails of 8s where full shape should be. It's different from expected because shapes like the 4-block in rows 0-2/cols 3-5 is intact but nearby 4s in row 2 cols 8-10 and row 5 col 10-13 indicate multiple components shifted independently, possibly with wrong special_v selection (min rare value) causing misdeltas. Unknown why 2s are at edges without corresponding shifts, but it mismatches if puzzle requires all larges to align perfectly to refs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on a direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of only those interactions, connections, or effects between elements/properties that are **obvious and consistent across EVERY train example** (i.e., present in train 1, 2, and 3 without exception). I focused solely on patterns that hold universally, ignoring any high-level puzzle solution, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., unchanged background bbox alone), or inconsistent behaviors (e.g., y-position shifts occur in train 2 but not 1 or 3, so y-transformation is called out as unknown rather than explained). No forced connections are included—only those derivable directly from matching components by color, pixels, and bbox across inputs/outputs. Components are considered "interconnected" if one property of one clearly affects or relates to another in a repeatable way (e.g., position influencing containment).

- **Color preservation across components**: Every component's color is preserved from input to output (e.g., all Maroon components remain Maroon, all Yellow remain Yellow, etc., with no color shifts or new colors introduced). This indicates no interaction between colors themselves, but connects individual component identity to the overall transformation rule—components do not change "type" via color, ensuring consistent tracking of elements like small accents (Yellow/Red/Pink) relative to primaries (Maroon/Blue/Green).

- **Pixel count preservation within components**: Each component's exact pixel count remains identical from input to output (e.g., a 1-pixel Yellow stays 1 pixel; a 9-pixel Maroon stays 9 pixels; totals per color match exactly, like 4 pixels of Blue in train 2). This connects the intrinsic "size" property of a component to its movement/transformation, implying rigid preservation of shape/silhouette without splitting, merging, or resizing—any position or bbox changes affect placement but not mass (pixels).

- **Small 1-pixel components interact with larger components via position-based containment/adjacency**: All 1-pixel components (e.g., Yellow/Red/Pink/Blue/Green/Maroon singles) are repositioned (x primarily, sometimes y) in the output to be contained within or directly adjacent to a larger same-y-level component's bbox (pixels >1), forming "inner" or "accent" relationships. This is consistent:
  - Train 1: 1-pixel Yellows/Blues/Maroons (e.g., [2,4] Yellow) moved inside/adjacent to larger Maroons (e.g., [1,3,3,4] → [4,3,6,4]).
  - Train 2: 1-pixel Pinks/Blues/Greens (e.g., [2,6] Pink → [2,8]; [10,3] Blue → [9,4]) placed inside/adjacent to larger Greens/Yellows (e.g., within [4,1,6,4] Green or next to [2,4,2,7] Yellow).
  - Train 3: 1-pixel Reds/Blues (e.g., [2,5] Red → [4,5]; [5,18] Blue → [4,18]) placed inside/adjacent to larger Blues (e.g., within [3,3,5,4] or [2,16,6,17]).
  The interaction is driven by input position (scattered) affecting output position (aligned relative to larger bbox), creating structured "assemblies" without changing pixels or color. No such containment for isolated 1-pixels without a nearby larger component.

- **Larger component (>1 pixel, holes=0) position interacts with small component placement**: The x-position (and sometimes width) of larger foreground components (e.g., multi-pixel Maroon/Blue/Green/Yellow) is adjusted leftward or centralized, which directly effects where small 1-pixel components are placed relative to them (as above). This holds consistently:
  - Train 1: Larger Maroons (e.g., [1,13,3,16] → [4,13,6,16], x shifted right but overall left-aligned in canvas) attract nearby small Yellows/Blues into their bbox.
  - Train 2: Larger Greens/Yellows (e.g., [4,4,6,7] → [4,1,6,4], x stable but y up) draw in small Maroons/Blues/Pinks.
  - Train 3: Larger Blues/Greens (e.g., [3,10,7,12] → [1,10,5,12], x narrowed/left) incorporate small Reds/Greens.
  The effect is positional: Input scattering leads to output clustering, where larger bbox expansion/contraction (x only in trains 1/3; unknown y in train 2) defines "boundaries" for small elements. Height (y2-y1) often preserved, connecting shape properties to movement constraints.

- **Holes property in background connects to small same-color components (limited consistency)**: The background component's holes (large bbox, high pixels) remains unchanged in bbox/pixels/color, but its hole count interacts with small same-color foreground components only when they are repositioned "into" it—decreasing holes by 1 per moved small element (observed in train 1: Blue bg holes 3→2 with 1 small Blue moved from [2,15]→[5,15], possibly filling). In trains 2/3, no hole change despite small same-color moves (e.g., no Green hole decrease in train 3 despite Green small repositioned), so this interaction is partial/unknown (may depend on unobservable overlap or specific color matching not consistent across all).

No other obvious consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no universal color-to-movement rule, as alignments vary by canvas width; no consistent hole effects for non-background; y-position changes are sporadic and unexplained). Irrelevant elements (e.g., fully unchanged single components like [4,0] Red in train 3) were excluded, as they show no interaction. This list applies directly to analyzing test inputs, where similar preservations and small-to-large positional effects should be checked.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
