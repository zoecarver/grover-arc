=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 10:56:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:12:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the goal is to identify distinct connected objects (non-background components), locate a "special" cell within each object (the position of a color that appears only once in that object), and translate the entire object rigidly so that the special cell aligns to a calculated target position based on grid dimensions, object size, shape, and orientation rules, while preserving the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the entire grid; all operations ignore it for connectivity.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells; diagonals do not count.
 * Each component must have exactly one singleton color (appears exactly once); if not, skip processing that component—no special cell means no translation.
 * Translation is a rigid shift (same dy, dx for all cells in the component); cells shifted out of bounds are discarded, originals are cleared to background.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > cols (tall), translation is primarily horizontal; if cols >= rows (wide), primarily vertical; special cases for very tall/narrow objects (height > 2*width) adjust vertical target using bg % rows.
 * Target position calculation uses "9 - dimension//2" as a central-ish offset (e.g., for size 20, 9-10= -1? Wait, seems like aiming for index 4 or similar, but code uses 9 - //2 which for even dims gives odd results—potential off-by-one subtlety).
 * For non-tall grids, additional adjustments if special_r < target (dx -=1), but only if not special_case.
 * Size==1 components don't move (dy=dx=0).
 * Subtleties: Ensure visited set prevents revisiting; stack-based DFS for component extraction; bounds calculation uses min/max rows/cols of component cells.
 * Easy to miss: Singleton must be unique (len(singleton_colors)==1), not just any rare color; translation applies to all cells including the special one; overlapping after shifts isn't handled (may overwrite, but puzzle likely assumes no overlap).
 * Components are processed independently in order found (top-left to bottom-right), so order might affect overlaps if any.
 * Grid can be irregular but assumed rectangular; empty grid returns as-is.

    rs = [r for r, _, _ in component]
    cs = [c for _, c, _ in component]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully identified background, extracted components via DFS, found singleton special cells, computed bounds, and applied translations based on tall/wide logic with special cases.
 * Worked perfectly for all three training examples (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of component detection, singleton identification, and basic translation rules.
 * get_translation function handles size=1 correctly (no move), tall vs. wide orientation, and special_case for disproportionate heights, but the "9 - //2" target formula may be empirically tuned—worked for training but could be off-by-one for certain dims.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_background, find_components, get_special, get_bounds, get_translation) are essential and correct for the puzzle mechanics.
 * Potential subtlety missed: The additional dx -=1 adjustment in non-tall, non-special_case when r < target may not always align as intended, but it passed training so likely correct there.
 * Component clearing and placing in new_grid preserves colors accurately; no overlaps handled explicitly, but assuming puzzle avoids them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 14x20 grid (inferred from row lengths) with background 8 dominant, and visible shifts of components: e.g., clusters of 4's, 6's, 3's, 2's appear repositioned (like a vertical stack of 3's on the right, horizontal 4's in top-middle, scattered 6's and 2's moved downward/leftward).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the program's logic—components are cleared and replanted without distortion, non-bg cells remain connected post-shift, and bg fills originals—but without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify if translations are precisely correct (e.g., did special singletons land at intended targets like row 4 or col 4?).
 * Potential issue: The output shows some components partially truncated (e.g., edge 4's or 3's might be cut off if shifts went out-of-bounds), which matches code but could be unintended if puzzle expects full preservation; also, the right-edge vertical 3's look like a tall component shifted right, but if grid is wide (20>14), vertical targets should dominate—seems plausible but the "9 - 14//2 = 9-7=2" target might misalign specials.
 * Differences from expected: Assuming standard rules, the scattered 2's (e.g., at [3,6]=2, [11,12]=2, [12,0]=2, [12,19]=2) suggest multiple small components moved independently, which is correct, but the large top-left 4/6 cluster looks partially shifted left/up, potentially overlapping or not centering the singleton properly—it's different from a "clean" central alignment one might expect, indicating possible tweak needed in target calc for wide grids or special_case.
 * Overall, the test output demonstrates the program's mechanics working (no broken components, colors preserved) but may not be fully correct if the puzzle expects stricter centering (e.g., target=4 or dim//2 directly, not 9-//2); it's close but subtly off in positions compared to mental simulation of rules.

[2025-10-02 11:12:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:36:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving colored grids (numbers as colors) where the task is to identify a background color and rare "special" colors, then align connected components or isolated cells of those special colors either horizontally or vertically based on the presence and positions of single-cell components, ultimately transforming the grid to a standardized or "solved" configuration. The rules prioritize rare colors (low counts, excluding background) and use connectivity (4-way) to group cells into components for alignment, with ties broken by minimal values or positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all other frequent colors are ignored for special treatment.
 * Special colors are non-background with counts <=4, sorted by increasing count then value; process them in that order to avoid overwriting.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) and exclude background; only non-background cells are considered connected.
 * Singles are isolated special cells (component size ==1); if exactly 1 single for a color, align all components of that color horizontally to the single's column (using the topmost special cell in the component for shift calc, and clear old positions with background).
 * If multiple singles (>1), align all special cells vertically to the row of the leftmost/topmost single (min column, then min row), but only move singles individually while keeping columns—note this treats them as independent, potentially ignoring components.
 * Alignment shifts must stay within grid bounds; out-of-bounds moves are discarded, and targets can overwrite existing cells.
 * Process colors sequentially on a copied grid, so earlier alignments can affect later ones (e.g., overwriting might merge or split components unexpectedly).
 * Subtlety: Horizontal alignment moves entire components rigidly by column shift, but vertical only moves individual special cells (not full components), which may disconnect or ignore connected groups— this asymmetry is key and likely a bug source.
 * Tie-breaking: For special color selection, min count then min value; for anchors, min row for horizontal pick, min (col, row) for vertical.
 * Easy to miss: Components can contain multiple special cells of the same color, but alignment uses only specials for processing; non-special cells in components move too in horizontal but not vertical.
 * Counts are computed once at start, but grid mutates, so positions/components change mid-process—recomputing counts per color might help but isn't done.
 * Grid is rectangular; empty rows/columns possible but height/width from input.
 * Overwriting: New positions overwrite without check, which can merge colors or create new backgrounds.

These functions are helpful for identifying background, specials, positions, and components; they correctly implement frequency counting, BFS for connectivity, and position extraction. The alignment functions (align_horizontal, align_vertical) are partially helpful but flawed (see below).

```python
def align_horizontal(g: List[List[int]], special_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], anchor_c: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (as in the provided program; helpful for rigid component shifts but buggy in processing multiples)
    pass  # Omitted full body for brevity; note it clears old and places new, but may shift different components differently if not careful.

def align_vertical(g: List[List[int]], special_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], anchor_r: int, special: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (as in the provided program; helpful for simple row shifts but only moves specials, ignoring components—likely unhelpful for connected groups)
    pass  # This function is broken/not fully aligned with rules, as it doesn't handle components.
```
The vertical align is unhelpful/broken because it only shifts individual special cells without considering connectivity, leading to incorrect handling of grouped specials.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 3, likely due to simple single-single or multi-single cases where horizontal/vertical alignments matched expectations without complex interactions.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output has misaligned components, e.g., row 3 has [4,8,8,...3,1,3,...] instead of expected [8,8,8,...3,8,3,...3,3,3,...], and row 4 has scattered 4's and 3's not vertically aligned to anchor; also, bottom rows have 6's in wrong positions (e.g., row 8 [6,8,6,...] vs expected [8,8,4,...] with 6's lower). Differences: Generated keeps some horizontal spreads of 3's and 4's but shifts them incorrectly (e.g., 4's not cleared to background in upper rows), and vertical alignment for multiples seems to ignore components, leaving 1's and 3's disconnected; unknown why 6's are misplaced in row 8—possibly order of processing rares overwrote alignments.
 * Missed handling full components in vertical alignment: Only singles move, but if specials are connected, the group should shift rigidly (inferred from horizontal symmetry and train 2 mismatches).
 * extract_objects equivalent (get_component) is essential for identifying singles and groups, but underused in vertical case.
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes for 3's and 4's (e.g., generated has a vertical stack of 3's in cols 9-11 rows 3-5, but expected has horizontal in row 4 and scattered elsewhere; unknown exact cause, possibly wrong anchor selection or overwriting).
 * Function align_vertical is incorrect/not relevant as-is (doesn't move components, only specials—don't use without fixing to handle connectivity like horizontal).
 * Overall, sequential processing of rares works for simple cases (train 1/3) but fails when alignments interact (train 2), e.g., a later rare overwriting an earlier one's alignment.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have partially aligned some components (e.g., 4's in cols 14-16 rows 1-2-3 seem horizontally gathered, and 3's in col 17 rows 6-9 vertically somewhat aligned), but many elements are misaligned or unchanged, e.g., upper 6's in row 0-1 cols 3-5 not shifted, scattered 2's remain isolated without alignment, and lower 4's/6's/3's in rows 6-10 show irregular shifts (e.g., row 9 has 4 in col 10 but expected likely consolidates to a single vertical/horizontal line based on singles).
 * Missing full component shifts: For example, the 6's in row 9 col 18 and row 10 col 18 seem unaligned, and 2's in row 11 col 12 and row 12 col 0/19 are not gathered—suggests vertical alignment failed to move groups.
 * The output retains too much original scattering (e.g., 4's in row 5 col 4 and row 6 col 4-6 not merged), differing from expected clean alignments inferred from training (e.g., train 2 expects tight horizontal 3's in row 3 and vertical elsewhere); does not make sense as a solved grid, as rares aren't fully consolidated.
 * To handle test case, need to ensure vertical alignment moves entire components rigidly (like horizontal), reselect anchors after each color, and process in reverse rarity order to avoid overwrites.

[2025-10-02 11:36:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving colored grids (numbers as colors) where the task is to identify a background color and rare "special" colors, then align connected components or isolated cells of those special colors either horizontally or vertically based on the presence and positions of single-cell components, ultimately transforming the grid to a standardized or "solved" configuration. The rules prioritize rare colors (low counts, excluding background) and use connectivity (4-way) to group cells into components for alignment, with ties broken by minimal values or positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all other frequent colors are ignored for special treatment.
 * Special colors are non-background with counts <=4, sorted by increasing count then value; process them in that order to avoid overwriting.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) and exclude background; only non-background cells are considered connected.
 * Singles are isolated special cells (component size ==1); if exactly 1 single for a color, align all components of that color horizontally to the single's column (using the topmost special cell in the component for shift calc, and clear old positions with background).
 * If multiple singles (>1), align all special cells vertically to the row of the leftmost/topmost single (min column, then min row), but only move singles individually while keeping columns—note this treats them as independent, potentially ignoring components.
 * Alignment shifts must stay within grid bounds; out-of-bounds moves are discarded, and targets can overwrite existing cells.
 * Process colors sequentially on a copied grid, so earlier alignments can affect later ones (e.g., overwriting might merge or split components unexpectedly).
 * Subtlety: Horizontal alignment moves entire components rigidly by column shift, but vertical only moves individual special cells (not full components), which may disconnect or ignore connected groups— this asymmetry is key and likely a bug source.
 * Tie-breaking: For special color selection, min count then min value; for anchors, min row for horizontal pick, min (col, row) for vertical.
 * Easy to miss: Components can contain multiple special cells of the same color, but alignment uses only specials for processing; non-special cells in components move too in horizontal but not vertical.
 * Counts are computed once at start, but grid mutates, so positions/components change mid-process—recomputing counts per color might help but isn't done.
 * Grid is rectangular; empty rows/columns possible but height/width from input.
 * Overwriting: New positions overwrite without check, which can merge colors or create new backgrounds.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, deque

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color as the most frequent color."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

def get_special(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, counts: dict) -> int:
    """Identify the special color as the non-background color with minimal count, tie broken by smallest value."""
    non_bg_counts = {k: v for k, v in counts.items() if k != bg and v > 0}
    if not non_bg_counts:
        return -1
    return min(non_bg_counts, key=lambda k: (non_bg_counts[k], k))

def get_special_positions(g: List[List[int]], special: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Get all positions of the special color in the current grid."""
    return [(r, c) for r in range(height) for c in range(width) if g[r][c] == special]

def get_component(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Find the connected component of non-background cells starting from (start_r, start_c) using 4-connectivity."""
    queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])
    visited = set([(start_r, start_c)])
    component = set()
    dirs = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        component.add((r, c))
        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and g[nr][nc] != bg and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the goal is to identify distinct connected objects (non-background components), locate a "special" cell within each object (the position of a color that appears only once in that object), and translate the entire object rigidly so that the special cell aligns to a calculated target position based on grid dimensions, object size, shape, and orientation rules, while preserving the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the entire grid; all operations ignore it for connectivity.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells; diagonals do not count.
 * Each component must have exactly one singleton color (appears exactly once); if not, skip processing that component—no special cell means no translation.
 * Translation is a rigid shift (same dy, dx for all cells in the component); cells shifted out of bounds are discarded, originals are cleared to background.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > cols (tall), translation is primarily horizontal; if cols >= rows (wide), primarily vertical; special cases for very tall/narrow objects (height > 2*width) adjust vertical target using bg % rows.
 * Target position calculation uses "9 - dimension//2" as a central-ish offset (e.g., for size 20, 9-10= -1? Wait, seems like aiming for index 4 or similar, but code uses 9 - //2 which for even dims gives odd results—potential off-by-one subtlety).
 * For non-tall grids, additional adjustments if special_r < target (dx -=1), but only if not special_case.
 * Size==1 components don't move (dy=dx=0).
 * Subtleties: Ensure visited set prevents revisiting; stack-based DFS for component extraction; bounds calculation uses min/max rows/cols of component cells.
 * Easy to miss: Singleton must be unique (len(singleton_colors)==1), not just any rare color; translation applies to all cells including the special one; overlapping after shifts isn't handled (may overwrite, but puzzle likely assumes no overlap).
 * Components are processed independently in order found (top-left to bottom-right), so order might affect overlaps if any.
 * Grid can be irregular but assumed rectangular; empty grid returns as-is.

    cs = [c for _, c, _ in component]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully identified background, extracted components via DFS, found singleton special cells, computed bounds, and applied translations based on tall/wide logic with special cases.
 * Worked perfectly for all three training examples (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of component detection, singleton identification, and basic translation rules.
 * get_translation function handles size=1 correctly (no move), tall vs. wide orientation, and special_case for disproportionate heights, but the "9 - //2" target formula may be empirically tuned—worked for training but could be off-by-one for certain dims.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_background, find_components, get_special, get_bounds, get_translation) are essential and correct for the puzzle mechanics.
 * Potential subtlety missed: The additional dx -=1 adjustment in non-tall, non-special_case when r < target may not always align as intended, but it passed training so likely correct there.
 * Component clearing and placing in new_grid preserves colors accurately; no overlaps handled explicitly, but assuming puzzle avoids them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 14x20 grid (inferred from row lengths) with background 8 dominant, and visible shifts of components: e.g., clusters of 4's, 6's, 3's, 2's appear repositioned (like a vertical stack of 3's on the right, horizontal 4's in top-middle, scattered 6's and 2's moved downward/leftward).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the program's logic—components are cleared and replanted without distortion, non-bg cells remain connected post-shift, and bg fills originals—but without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify if translations are precisely correct (e.g., did special singletons land at intended targets like row 4 or col 4?).
 * Potential issue: The output shows some components partially truncated (e.g., edge 4's or 3's might be cut off if shifts went out-of-bounds), which matches code but could be unintended if puzzle expects full preservation; also, the right-edge vertical 3's look like a tall component shifted right, but if grid is wide (20>14), vertical targets should dominate—seems plausible but the "9 - 14//2 = 9-7=2" target might misalign specials.
 * Differences from expected: Assuming standard rules, the scattered 2's (e.g., at [3,6]=2, [11,12]=2, [12,0]=2, [12,19]=2) suggest multiple small components moved independently, which is correct, but the large top-left 4/6 cluster looks partially shifted left/up, potentially overlapping or not centering the singleton properly—it's different from a "clean" central alignment one might expect, indicating possible tweak needed in target calc for wide grids or special_case.
 * Overall, the test output demonstrates the program's mechanics working (no broken components, colors preserved) but may not be fully correct if the puzzle expects stricter centering (e.g., target=4 or dim//2 directly, not 9-//2); it's close but subtly off in positions compared to mental simulation of rules.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

[2025-10-02 11:47:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected components (non-background regions) by shifting them according to specific rules based on grid dimensions, component shapes, and a "special" unique cell within each component, likely to align or reposition elements into a target configuration (e.g., centering or offsetting for puzzle resolution). The background color is the most frequent, and manipulations preserve component integrity while clearing originals.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the flattened grid; assume it's 8 in examples, but compute dynamically to handle variations.
 * Components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells; single-cell components are ignored (len(comp) <=1 skips them).
 * Each valid component must have exactly one "special" cell: a color that appears only once in the component (singleton); if not exactly one, skip the component.
 * Shifting logic depends on grid aspect ratio: if tall (rows > cols), shift horizontally to near the right (target_c = 9 - (w//2)), but override to bg % w if component is horizontally wide (comp_w > 2*comp_h); if wide (rows <= cols), shift vertically to near the bottom (target_r = 9 - (h//2)), override to bg % h if vertically tall (comp_h > 2*comp_w), and add a leftward nudge (dx -=1) if special row is above target and not special case.
 * Bounds are min/max row/col of component for size calculation (comp_h, comp_w); shifts are relative to the special cell's position (sr, sc).
 * After shifting, place cells only if within bounds; originals are cleared to background first.
 * Subtlety: Grid is always 20x something? (test has 20 cols implied by lists), but generalize to h x w; 9 in targets suggests a fixed "canvas" size influence (e.g., 18 or 20 dim?).
 * Easy to miss: Shifts can clip (out-of-bounds cells lost); special cell anchors shift, not component center; no rotation or scaling, just translation; components don't overlap post-shift (but code doesn't check/prevent).
 * All training examples passed, implying rules capture core alignment for those cases (likely simple shifts), but test may reveal edge cases like multiple components or clipping.
 * Consider component colors: preserved exactly, including the special; bg % dim for overrides uses background value directly (e.g., 8%20=8).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for isolating components; works in all cases.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows_n = len(g)
    cols_n = len(g[0])
    visited = set()
    components = []
    dirs: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows_n):
        for j in range(cols_n):
            if (i, j) not in visited and g[i][j] != bg:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited.add((i, j))
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y, g[x][y]))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows_n and 0 <= ny < cols_n and (nx, ny) not in visited and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited.add((nx, ny))
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder is robust for 4-connected regions; includes position and color; skips bg; helpful for all extractions.)

```python
def get_special(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return -1, -1, -1
    color_count = Counter(col for _, _, col in component)
    singleton_colors = [col for col, cnt in color_count.items() if cnt == 1]
    if len(singleton_colors) != 1:
        return -1, -1, -1
    s = singleton_colors[0]
    for r, c, col in component:
        if col == s:
            return r, c, s
    return -1, -1, -1
```
(Key for identifying anchor cell; strict singleton check ensures valid "special"; returns -1 on failure to skip invalid components.)

```python
def get_bounds(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _, _ in component]
    cs = [c for _, c, _ in component]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Useful for computing component dimensions; simple min/max; used in shift decisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of background detection, component extraction, special cell identification, and conditional shifting.
 * Worked: Component finding and special detection logic correctly isolated and anchored regions in training cases; shifting rules (tall/wide, overrides, nudge) aligned elements properly for those inputs.
 * Didn't work (or unknown): No failures in training, but the attempt lacks handling for overlapping post-shift components, rotation, or non-rectangular alignments; single attempt, so no iteration on failures yet.
 * The main program integrates all functions well but hardcodes "9 -" targets (subtle puzzle canvas size?); skips small/invalid components correctly.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant and functional (none broken, though shifting could be refined for clipping visualization).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x20 grid (inferred from row lists of 20 elements each, 14 rows listed) with mostly 8 (bg) and scattered non-bg cells (e.g., 4s, 6s, 3s, 2s); components appear shifted right/down compared to a mental "original" (not provided, but assuming standard input has left/top placements).
 * It makes partial sense: Visible structures like vertical 3-6-3 lines on right (rows 1-3, cols 18-19), a 2 in row 3 col 6, scattered 4s/6s in top-left/mid, and bottom 4/2 placements; looks like repositioned blobs (e.g., a "tall" component shifted horizontally, wide ones vertically).
 * Does not look fully correct (speculation based on rules): Expected more centralized alignments (e.g., specials near col 9-10 or row 9-10 per "9 - (dim//2)"), but test has elements near edges (e.g., 3s at col 19, 2 at row 12 col 0); possible clipping lost cells (e.g., if dx/dy pushed out); differences include uneven spacing (e.g., row 2 has 6-4-4-4 cluster not tightly bound) and potential missed special (unknown without original input); bg % dim overrides may have misaligned wide/tall components (e.g., 8%20=8 targets col 8, but some are at 18+).
 * Overall, test output demonstrates manipulation but likely incorrect in precise positioning (e.g., too right-heavy; expected more balanced after shifts); unknown exact expected without target, but mismatches subtle nudge/override application.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 11:47:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving colored grids (numbers as colors) where the task is to identify a background color and rare "special" colors, then align connected components or isolated cells of those special colors either horizontally or vertically based on the presence and positions of single-cell components, ultimately transforming the grid to a standardized or "solved" configuration. The rules prioritize rare colors (low counts, excluding background) and use connectivity (4-way) to group cells into components for alignment, with ties broken by minimal values or positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all other frequent colors are ignored for special treatment.
 * Special colors are non-background with counts <=4, sorted by increasing count then value; process them in that order to avoid overwriting.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) and exclude background; only non-background cells are considered connected.
 * Singles are isolated special cells (component size ==1); if exactly 1 single for a color, align all components of that color horizontally to the single's column (using the topmost special cell in the component for shift calc, and clear old positions with background).
 * If multiple singles (>1), align all special cells vertically to the row of the leftmost/topmost single (min column, then min row), but only move singles individually while keeping columns—note this treats them as independent, potentially ignoring components.
 * Alignment shifts must stay within grid bounds; out-of-bounds moves are discarded, and targets can overwrite existing cells.
 * Process colors sequentially on a copied grid, so earlier alignments can affect later ones (e.g., overwriting might merge or split components unexpectedly).
 * Subtlety: Horizontal alignment moves entire components rigidly by column shift, but vertical only moves individual special cells (not full components), which may disconnect or ignore connected groups— this asymmetry is key and likely a bug source.
 * Tie-breaking: For special color selection, min count then min value; for anchors, min row for horizontal pick, min (col, row) for vertical.
 * Easy to miss: Components can contain multiple special cells of the same color, but alignment uses only specials for processing; non-special cells in components move too in horizontal but not vertical.
 * Counts are computed once at start, but grid mutates, so positions/components change mid-process—recomputing counts per color might help but isn't done.
 * Grid is rectangular; empty rows/columns possible but height/width from input.
 * Overwriting: New positions overwrite without check, which can merge colors or create new backgrounds.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, deque

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color as the most frequent color."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

def get_special(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, counts: dict) -> int:
    """Identify the special color as the non-background color with minimal count, tie broken by smallest value."""
    non_bg_counts = {k: v for k, v in counts.items() if k != bg and v > 0}
    if not non_bg_counts:
        return -1
    return min(non_bg_counts, key=lambda k: (non_bg_counts[k], k))

def get_special_positions(g: List[List[int]], special: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Get all positions of the special color in the current grid."""
    return [(r, c) for r in range(height) for c in range(width) if g[r][c] == special]

def get_component(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Find the connected component of non-background cells starting from (start_r, start_c) using 4-connectivity."""
    queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])
    visited = set([(start_r, start_c)])
    component = set()
    dirs = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        component.add((r, c))
        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and g[nr][nc] != bg and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
These functions are helpful for identifying background, specials, positions, and components; they correctly implement frequency counting, BFS for connectivity, and position extraction. The alignment functions (align_horizontal, align_vertical) are partially helpful but flawed (see below).

```python
def align_horizontal(g: List[List[int]], special_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], anchor_c: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (as in the provided program; helpful for rigid component shifts but buggy in processing multiples)
    pass  # Omitted full body for brevity; note it clears old and places new, but may shift different components differently if not careful.

def align_vertical(g: List[List[int]], special_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], anchor_r: int, special: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (as in the provided program; helpful for simple row shifts but only moves specials, ignoring components—likely unhelpful for connected groups)
    pass  # This function is broken/not fully aligned with rules, as it doesn't handle components.
```
The vertical align is unhelpful/broken because it only shifts individual special cells without considering connectivity, leading to incorrect handling of grouped specials.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 3, likely due to simple single-single or multi-single cases where horizontal/vertical alignments matched expectations without complex interactions.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output has misaligned components, e.g., row 3 has [4,8,8,...3,1,3,...] instead of expected [8,8,8,...3,8,3,...3,3,3,...], and row 4 has scattered 4's and 3's not vertically aligned to anchor; also, bottom rows have 6's in wrong positions (e.g., row 8 [6,8,6,...] vs expected [8,8,4,...] with 6's lower). Differences: Generated keeps some horizontal spreads of 3's and 4's but shifts them incorrectly (e.g., 4's not cleared to background in upper rows), and vertical alignment for multiples seems to ignore components, leaving 1's and 3's disconnected; unknown why 6's are misplaced in row 8—possibly order of processing rares overwrote alignments.
 * Missed handling full components in vertical alignment: Only singles move, but if specials are connected, the group should shift rigidly (inferred from horizontal symmetry and train 2 mismatches).
 * extract_objects equivalent (get_component) is essential for identifying singles and groups, but underused in vertical case.
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes for 3's and 4's (e.g., generated has a vertical stack of 3's in cols 9-11 rows 3-5, but expected has horizontal in row 4 and scattered elsewhere; unknown exact cause, possibly wrong anchor selection or overwriting).
 * Function align_vertical is incorrect/not relevant as-is (doesn't move components, only specials—don't use without fixing to handle connectivity like horizontal).
 * Overall, sequential processing of rares works for simple cases (train 1/3) but fails when alignments interact (train 2), e.g., a later rare overwriting an earlier one's alignment.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have partially aligned some components (e.g., 4's in cols 14-16 rows 1-2-3 seem horizontally gathered, and 3's in col 17 rows 6-9 vertically somewhat aligned), but many elements are misaligned or unchanged, e.g., upper 6's in row 0-1 cols 3-5 not shifted, scattered 2's remain isolated without alignment, and lower 4's/6's/3's in rows 6-10 show irregular shifts (e.g., row 9 has 4 in col 10 but expected likely consolidates to a single vertical/horizontal line based on singles).
 * Missing full component shifts: For example, the 6's in row 9 col 18 and row 10 col 18 seem unaligned, and 2's in row 11 col 12 and row 12 col 0/19 are not gathered—suggests vertical alignment failed to move groups.
 * The output retains too much original scattering (e.g., 4's in row 5 col 4 and row 6 col 4-6 not merged), differing from expected clean alignments inferred from training (e.g., train 2 expects tight horizontal 3's in row 3 and vertical elsewhere); does not make sense as a solved grid, as rares aren't fully consolidated.
 * To handle test case, need to ensure vertical alignment moves entire components rigidly (like horizontal), reselect anchors after each color, and process in reverse rarity order to avoid overwrites.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected components (non-background regions) by shifting them according to specific rules based on grid dimensions, component shapes, and a "special" unique cell within each component, likely to align or reposition elements into a target configuration (e.g., centering or offsetting for puzzle resolution). The background color is the most frequent, and manipulations preserve component integrity while clearing originals.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the flattened grid; assume it's 8 in examples, but compute dynamically to handle variations.
 * Components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells; single-cell components are ignored (len(comp) <=1 skips them).
 * Each valid component must have exactly one "special" cell: a color that appears only once in the component (singleton); if not exactly one, skip the component.
 * Shifting logic depends on grid aspect ratio: if tall (rows > cols), shift horizontally to near the right (target_c = 9 - (w//2)), but override to bg % w if component is horizontally wide (comp_w > 2*comp_h); if wide (rows <= cols), shift vertically to near the bottom (target_r = 9 - (h//2)), override to bg % h if vertically tall (comp_h > 2*comp_w), and add a leftward nudge (dx -=1) if special row is above target and not special case.
 * Bounds are min/max row/col of component for size calculation (comp_h, comp_w); shifts are relative to the special cell's position (sr, sc).
 * After shifting, place cells only if within bounds; originals are cleared to background first.
 * Subtlety: Grid is always 20x something? (test has 20 cols implied by lists), but generalize to h x w; 9 in targets suggests a fixed "canvas" size influence (e.g., 18 or 20 dim?).
 * Easy to miss: Shifts can clip (out-of-bounds cells lost); special cell anchors shift, not component center; no rotation or scaling, just translation; components don't overlap post-shift (but code doesn't check/prevent).
 * All training examples passed, implying rules capture core alignment for those cases (likely simple shifts), but test may reveal edge cases like multiple components or clipping.
 * Consider component colors: preserved exactly, including the special; bg % dim for overrides uses background value directly (e.g., 8%20=8).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for isolating components; works in all cases.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows_n = len(g)
    cols_n = len(g[0])
    visited = set()
    components = []
    dirs: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows_n):
        for j in range(cols_n):
            if (i, j) not in visited and g[i][j] != bg:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited.add((i, j))
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y, g[x][y]))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows_n and 0 <= ny < cols_n and (nx, ny) not in visited and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited.add((nx, ny))
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder is robust for 4-connected regions; includes position and color; skips bg; helpful for all extractions.)

```python
def get_special(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return -1, -1, -1
    color_count = Counter(col for _, _, col in component)
    singleton_colors = [col for col, cnt in color_count.items() if cnt == 1]
    if len(singleton_colors) != 1:
        return -1, -1, -1
    s = singleton_colors[0]
    for r, c, col in component:
        if col == s:
            return r, c, s
    return -1, -1, -1
```
(Key for identifying anchor cell; strict singleton check ensures valid "special"; returns -1 on failure to skip invalid components.)

```python
def get_bounds(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _, _ in component]
    cs = [c for _, c, _ in component]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Useful for computing component dimensions; simple min/max; used in shift decisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of background detection, component extraction, special cell identification, and conditional shifting.
 * Worked: Component finding and special detection logic correctly isolated and anchored regions in training cases; shifting rules (tall/wide, overrides, nudge) aligned elements properly for those inputs.
 * Didn't work (or unknown): No failures in training, but the attempt lacks handling for overlapping post-shift components, rotation, or non-rectangular alignments; single attempt, so no iteration on failures yet.
 * The main program integrates all functions well but hardcodes "9 -" targets (subtle puzzle canvas size?); skips small/invalid components correctly.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant and functional (none broken, though shifting could be refined for clipping visualization).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x20 grid (inferred from row lists of 20 elements each, 14 rows listed) with mostly 8 (bg) and scattered non-bg cells (e.g., 4s, 6s, 3s, 2s); components appear shifted right/down compared to a mental "original" (not provided, but assuming standard input has left/top placements).
 * It makes partial sense: Visible structures like vertical 3-6-3 lines on right (rows 1-3, cols 18-19), a 2 in row 3 col 6, scattered 4s/6s in top-left/mid, and bottom 4/2 placements; looks like repositioned blobs (e.g., a "tall" component shifted horizontally, wide ones vertically).
 * Does not look fully correct (speculation based on rules): Expected more centralized alignments (e.g., specials near col 9-10 or row 9-10 per "9 - (dim//2)"), but test has elements near edges (e.g., 3s at col 19, 2 at row 12 col 0); possible clipping lost cells (e.g., if dx/dy pushed out); differences include uneven spacing (e.g., row 2 has 6-4-4-4 cluster not tightly bound) and potential missed special (unknown without original input); bg % dim overrides may have misaligned wide/tall components (e.g., 8%20=8 targets col 8, but some are at 18+).
 * Overall, test output demonstrates manipulation but likely incorrect in precise positioning (e.g., too right-heavy; expected more balanced after shifts); unknown exact expected without target, but mismatches subtle nudge/override application.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the goal is to identify distinct connected objects (non-background components), locate a "special" cell within each object (the position of a color that appears only once in that object), and translate the entire object rigidly so that the special cell aligns to a calculated target position based on grid dimensions, object size, shape, and orientation rules, while preserving the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the entire grid; all operations ignore it for connectivity.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells; diagonals do not count.
 * Each component must have exactly one singleton color (appears exactly once); if not, skip processing that component—no special cell means no translation.
 * Translation is a rigid shift (same dy, dx for all cells in the component); cells shifted out of bounds are discarded, originals are cleared to background.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > cols (tall), translation is primarily horizontal; if cols >= rows (wide), primarily vertical; special cases for very tall/narrow objects (height > 2*width) adjust vertical target using bg % rows.
 * Target position calculation uses "9 - dimension//2" as a central-ish offset (e.g., for size 20, 9-10= -1? Wait, seems like aiming for index 4 or similar, but code uses 9 - //2 which for even dims gives odd results—potential off-by-one subtlety).
 * For non-tall grids, additional adjustments if special_r < target (dx -=1), but only if not special_case.
 * Size==1 components don't move (dy=dx=0).
 * Subtleties: Ensure visited set prevents revisiting; stack-based DFS for component extraction; bounds calculation uses min/max rows/cols of component cells.
 * Easy to miss: Singleton must be unique (len(singleton_colors)==1), not just any rare color; translation applies to all cells including the special one; overlapping after shifts isn't handled (may overwrite, but puzzle likely assumes no overlap).
 * Components are processed independently in order found (top-left to bottom-right), so order might affect overlaps if any.
 * Grid can be irregular but assumed rectangular; empty grid returns as-is.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully identified background, extracted components via DFS, found singleton special cells, computed bounds, and applied translations based on tall/wide logic with special cases.
 * Worked perfectly for all three training examples (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of component detection, singleton identification, and basic translation rules.
 * get_translation function handles size=1 correctly (no move), tall vs. wide orientation, and special_case for disproportionate heights, but the "9 - //2" target formula may be empirically tuned—worked for training but could be off-by-one for certain dims.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_background, find_components, get_special, get_bounds, get_translation) are essential and correct for the puzzle mechanics.
 * Potential subtlety missed: The additional dx -=1 adjustment in non-tall, non-special_case when r < target may not always align as intended, but it passed training so likely correct there.
 * Component clearing and placing in new_grid preserves colors accurately; no overlaps handled explicitly, but assuming puzzle avoids them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 14x20 grid (inferred from row lengths) with background 8 dominant, and visible shifts of components: e.g., clusters of 4's, 6's, 3's, 2's appear repositioned (like a vertical stack of 3's on the right, horizontal 4's in top-middle, scattered 6's and 2's moved downward/leftward).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the program's logic—components are cleared and replanted without distortion, non-bg cells remain connected post-shift, and bg fills originals—but without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify if translations are precisely correct (e.g., did special singletons land at intended targets like row 4 or col 4?).
 * Potential issue: The output shows some components partially truncated (e.g., edge 4's or 3's might be cut off if shifts went out-of-bounds), which matches code but could be unintended if puzzle expects full preservation; also, the right-edge vertical 3's look like a tall component shifted right, but if grid is wide (20>14), vertical targets should dominate—seems plausible but the "9 - 14//2 = 9-7=2" target might misalign specials.
 * Differences from expected: Assuming standard rules, the scattered 2's (e.g., at [3,6]=2, [11,12]=2, [12,0]=2, [12,19]=2) suggest multiple small components moved independently, which is correct, but the large top-left 4/6 cluster looks partially shifted left/up, potentially overlapping or not centering the singleton properly—it's different from a "clean" central alignment one might expect, indicating possible tweak needed in target calc for wide grids or special_case.
 * Overall, the test output demonstrates the program's mechanics working (no broken components, colors preserved) but may not be fully correct if the puzzle expects stricter centering (e.g., target=4 or dim//2 directly, not 9-//2); it's close but subtly off in positions compared to mental simulation of rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 11:53:55] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify and manipulate "objects" (connected groups of non-background cells) by translating them to specific target positions on the grid, guided by rules involving the grid's overall dimensions (tall vs. wide), the object's aspect ratio, a "special" anchor cell (a unique singleton color within the object), and the background color for overrides in positioning. The output is a modified grid with objects moved (erased from original positions and placed at new ones, without overlapping or going out of bounds).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all manipulations treat non-background cells as part of potential objects.
 * Objects are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; single-cell objects are ignored for movement.
 * Each object must have exactly one "special" cell: a color that appears only once in the entire object (singleton); if not exactly one, the object is skipped (no movement).
 * Object bounds are computed as min/max row/col to determine its height (comp_h) and width (comp_w).
 * Grid orientation matters: if tall (h > w), objects move horizontally (dx only); if wide (h <= w), move vertically (dy only, with a potential -1 dx adjustment if the special row is below target and no override).
 * Target position is based on centering: for tall grid, target column is 9 - (w // 2); for wide, target row is 9 - (h // 2). But overrides apply if object is extremely elongated (comp_w > 2 * comp_h for horizontal override, or comp_h > 2 * comp_w for vertical), setting target to bg % dimension (bg modulo grid width/height).
 * Translation is relative to the special cell's position: dy/dx = target - special_pos; entire object shifts rigidly by this vector, but only cells landing in-bounds are placed (original positions set to bg).
 * Subtlety: The "9 -" in targets suggests a possible fixed assumption about grid size (e.g., 20x20 or similar, but code uses actual h/w); this might be puzzle-specific and could break on varying sizes—ensure it generalizes.
 * Overlap handling is implicit (new cells overwrite, but since objects are processed sequentially and originals erased, overlaps might occur if not careful; code doesn't prevent inter-object overlaps).
 * Edge case: Empty grid or all-bg returns unchanged; components with no special or <=1 cell are skipped.
 * Potential miss: The dx -=1 adjustment in wide case (if sr < target_r and not override) seems like a heuristic for alignment—verify if it's always needed or puzzle-specific (e.g., for shifting left in certain configs).
 * Color preservation: Moved cells keep their original colors; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Connectivity post-move: Not enforced; objects might disconnect if partial (out-of-bounds), but puzzle likely assumes full in-bounds moves.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Identifies the dominant background color reliably; essential for isolating objects.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if h == 0 or w == 0:
        return []
    visited = set()
    components = []
    dirs: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if (i, j) not in visited and g[i][j] != bg:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited.add((i, j))
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y, g[x][y]))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and (nx, ny) not in visited and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited.add((nx, ny))
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```
(Extracts 4-connected components as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; uses DFS via stack for efficiency; core for object detection.)

```python
def get_special(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return -1, -1, -1
    color_count = Counter(col for _, _, col in component)
    singleton_colors = [col for col, cnt in color_count.items() if cnt == 1]
    if len(singleton_colors) != 1:
        return -1, -1, -1
    s = singleton_colors[0]
    for r, c, col in component:
        if col == s:
            return r, c, s
    return -1, -1, -1
```
(Finds the unique singleton color cell as the translation anchor; skips if not exactly one—key for determining movement pivot.)

```python
def get_bounds(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _, _ in component]
    cs = [c for _, c, _ in component]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Computes min/max row/col for object dimensions; simple but crucial for aspect ratio checks and overrides.)

```python
def compute_translation(sr: int, sc: int, comp_h: int, comp_w: int, h: int, w: int, bg: int, is_tall: bool) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    dy = 0
    dx = 0
    if is_tall:
        target_c = 9 - (w // 2)
        override = comp_w > 2 * comp_h
        if override:
            target_c = bg % w
        dx = target_c - sc
    else:
        target_r = 9 - (h // 2)
        override = comp_h > 2 * comp_w
        if override:
            target_r = bg % h
        dy = target_r - sr
        dx = 0
        if sr < target_r and not override:
            dx -= 1
    return dy, dx
```
(Encapsulates the translation logic, including tall/wide distinction, centering, aspect overrides with bg modulo, and the subtle dx adjustment; central to the puzzle rules but may need tuning for the "9 -" constant.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying background (likely 8 in many cases), extracting components, finding specials, and applying translations with overrides, resulting in expected outputs.
 * What worked: Component detection and special cell identification are robust (passed training); translation logic captured core rules like tall/wide orientation and aspect overrides.
 * What didn't work: The "9 -" in target calculations assumes a specific centering (e.g., for 20-unit grids?), which might not generalize if grid sizes vary; the dx -=1 adjustment in wide cases is heuristic and could be incorrect for some configs (unknown if it failed training, but worth verifying).
 * Skipped single-cell or non-singleton objects correctly, avoiding unnecessary moves.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates solid understanding of object extraction and movement; unhelpful elements include none— all functions are relevant, though compute_translation's hardcoded "9" feels brittle.
 * Function `program` integrates everything well but processes components sequentially without overlap prevention, which might cause issues if objects collide post-move (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x20 grid (inferred from lines) with mostly 8s (likely bg), scattered non-8 cells (e.g., 4s, 6s, 3s, 2s) forming what look like moved objects: e.g., a cluster of 4s/6s in top-left/mid, 3s on right edge, 2s at bottom.
 * It appears to reflect successful translations: e.g., vertical/horizontal shifts of small components (like the 3-pair on right, possibly moved down; 2s at (3,6) and bottom row); bg=8 dominates, and no obvious out-of-bounds artifacts.
 * However, it does not look fully correct without the input grid for comparison—e.g., the top rows have irregular 4/6/3 placements that might not align with expected centering (e.g., if grid is wide h=14<w=20, vertical moves to row ~9 -7=2, but clusters are at rows 0-3); the override using bg%w (8%20=8) might explain some positions, but the dx-=1 could misalign horizontally.
 * Specific differences: Expected output should have all objects fully translated without remnants (code erases originals, so clean), but without input, hard to confirm—e.g., if input had a tall object overridden to col 8, but output shows spread 4s/6s not centered there; the bottom 2s at (12,0) and (12,19) look symmetric but might be unintended splits.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense (plausible moves, no crashes), but likely incorrect in precise positioning (e.g., the "9 -" might be wrong for h=14/w=20, leading to off-center targets like row 2 instead of true center ~6-7); it's different from ideal by potentially misapplying the adjustment or override, resulting in non-centered clusters.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 11:53:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving colored grids (numbers as colors) where the task is to identify a background color and rare "special" colors, then align connected components or isolated cells of those special colors either horizontally or vertically based on the presence and positions of single-cell components, ultimately transforming the grid to a standardized or "solved" configuration. The rules prioritize rare colors (low counts, excluding background) and use connectivity (4-way) to group cells into components for alignment, with ties broken by minimal values or positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent in the flattened grid; all other frequent colors are ignored for special treatment.
 * Special colors are non-background with counts <=4, sorted by increasing count then value; process them in that order to avoid overwriting.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) and exclude background; only non-background cells are considered connected.
 * Singles are isolated special cells (component size ==1); if exactly 1 single for a color, align all components of that color horizontally to the single's column (using the topmost special cell in the component for shift calc, and clear old positions with background).
 * If multiple singles (>1), align all special cells vertically to the row of the leftmost/topmost single (min column, then min row), but only move singles individually while keeping columns—note this treats them as independent, potentially ignoring components.
 * Alignment shifts must stay within grid bounds; out-of-bounds moves are discarded, and targets can overwrite existing cells.
 * Process colors sequentially on a copied grid, so earlier alignments can affect later ones (e.g., overwriting might merge or split components unexpectedly).
 * Subtlety: Horizontal alignment moves entire components rigidly by column shift, but vertical only moves individual special cells (not full components), which may disconnect or ignore connected groups— this asymmetry is key and likely a bug source.
 * Tie-breaking: For special color selection, min count then min value; for anchors, min row for horizontal pick, min (col, row) for vertical.
 * Easy to miss: Components can contain multiple special cells of the same color, but alignment uses only specials for processing; non-special cells in components move too in horizontal but not vertical.
 * Counts are computed once at start, but grid mutates, so positions/components change mid-process—recomputing counts per color might help but isn't done.
 * Grid is rectangular; empty rows/columns possible but height/width from input.
 * Overwriting: New positions overwrite without check, which can merge colors or create new backgrounds.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter, deque

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color as the most frequent color."""
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]

def get_special(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, counts: dict) -> int:
    """Identify the special color as the non-background color with minimal count, tie broken by smallest value."""
    non_bg_counts = {k: v for k, v in counts.items() if k != bg and v > 0}
    if not non_bg_counts:
        return -1
    return min(non_bg_counts, key=lambda k: (non_bg_counts[k], k))

def get_special_positions(g: List[List[int]], special: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Get all positions of the special color in the current grid."""
    return [(r, c) for r in range(height) for c in range(width) if g[r][c] == special]

def get_component(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Find the connected component of non-background cells starting from (start_r, start_c) using 4-connectivity."""
    queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])
    visited = set([(start_r, start_c)])
    component = set()
    dirs = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        component.add((r, c))
        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and g[nr][nc] != bg and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
These functions are helpful for identifying background, specials, positions, and components; they correctly implement frequency counting, BFS for connectivity, and position extraction. The alignment functions (align_horizontal, align_vertical) are partially helpful but flawed (see below).

```python
def align_horizontal(g: List[List[int]], special_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], anchor_c: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (as in the provided program; helpful for rigid component shifts but buggy in processing multiples)
    pass  # Omitted full body for brevity; note it clears old and places new, but may shift different components differently if not careful.

def align_vertical(g: List[List[int]], special_pos: List[Tuple[int, int]], anchor_r: int, special: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (as in the provided program; helpful for simple row shifts but only moves specials, ignoring components—likely unhelpful for connected groups)
    pass  # This function is broken/not fully aligned with rules, as it doesn't handle components.
```
The vertical align is unhelpful/broken because it only shifts individual special cells without considering connectivity, leading to incorrect handling of grouped specials.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training example 1 and 3, likely due to simple single-single or multi-single cases where horizontal/vertical alignments matched expectations without complex interactions.
 * Failed on training example 2: Generated output has misaligned components, e.g., row 3 has [4,8,8,...3,1,3,...] instead of expected [8,8,8,...3,8,3,...3,3,3,...], and row 4 has scattered 4's and 3's not vertically aligned to anchor; also, bottom rows have 6's in wrong positions (e.g., row 8 [6,8,6,...] vs expected [8,8,4,...] with 6's lower). Differences: Generated keeps some horizontal spreads of 3's and 4's but shifts them incorrectly (e.g., 4's not cleared to background in upper rows), and vertical alignment for multiples seems to ignore components, leaving 1's and 3's disconnected; unknown why 6's are misplaced in row 8—possibly order of processing rares overwrote alignments.
 * Missed handling full components in vertical alignment: Only singles move, but if specials are connected, the group should shift rigidly (inferred from horizontal symmetry and train 2 mismatches).
 * extract_objects equivalent (get_component) is essential for identifying singles and groups, but underused in vertical case.
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes for 3's and 4's (e.g., generated has a vertical stack of 3's in cols 9-11 rows 3-5, but expected has horizontal in row 4 and scattered elsewhere; unknown exact cause, possibly wrong anchor selection or overwriting).
 * Function align_vertical is incorrect/not relevant as-is (doesn't move components, only specials—don't use without fixing to handle connectivity like horizontal).
 * Overall, sequential processing of rares works for simple cases (train 1/3) but fails when alignments interact (train 2), e.g., a later rare overwriting an earlier one's alignment.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have partially aligned some components (e.g., 4's in cols 14-16 rows 1-2-3 seem horizontally gathered, and 3's in col 17 rows 6-9 vertically somewhat aligned), but many elements are misaligned or unchanged, e.g., upper 6's in row 0-1 cols 3-5 not shifted, scattered 2's remain isolated without alignment, and lower 4's/6's/3's in rows 6-10 show irregular shifts (e.g., row 9 has 4 in col 10 but expected likely consolidates to a single vertical/horizontal line based on singles).
 * Missing full component shifts: For example, the 6's in row 9 col 18 and row 10 col 18 seem unaligned, and 2's in row 11 col 12 and row 12 col 0/19 are not gathered—suggests vertical alignment failed to move groups.
 * The output retains too much original scattering (e.g., 4's in row 5 col 4 and row 6 col 4-6 not merged), differing from expected clean alignments inferred from training (e.g., train 2 expects tight horizontal 3's in row 3 and vertical elsewhere); does not make sense as a solved grid, as rares aren't fully consolidated.
 * To handle test case, need to ensure vertical alignment moves entire components rigidly (like horizontal), reselect anchors after each color, and process in reverse rarity order to avoid overwrites.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected components (non-background regions) by shifting them according to specific rules based on grid dimensions, component shapes, and a "special" unique cell within each component, likely to align or reposition elements into a target configuration (e.g., centering or offsetting for puzzle resolution). The background color is the most frequent, and manipulations preserve component integrity while clearing originals.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color in the flattened grid; assume it's 8 in examples, but compute dynamically to handle variations.
 * Components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells; single-cell components are ignored (len(comp) <=1 skips them).
 * Each valid component must have exactly one "special" cell: a color that appears only once in the component (singleton); if not exactly one, skip the component.
 * Shifting logic depends on grid aspect ratio: if tall (rows > cols), shift horizontally to near the right (target_c = 9 - (w//2)), but override to bg % w if component is horizontally wide (comp_w > 2*comp_h); if wide (rows <= cols), shift vertically to near the bottom (target_r = 9 - (h//2)), override to bg % h if vertically tall (comp_h > 2*comp_w), and add a leftward nudge (dx -=1) if special row is above target and not special case.
 * Bounds are min/max row/col of component for size calculation (comp_h, comp_w); shifts are relative to the special cell's position (sr, sc).
 * After shifting, place cells only if within bounds; originals are cleared to background first.
 * Subtlety: Grid is always 20x something? (test has 20 cols implied by lists), but generalize to h x w; 9 in targets suggests a fixed "canvas" size influence (e.g., 18 or 20 dim?).
 * Easy to miss: Shifts can clip (out-of-bounds cells lost); special cell anchors shift, not component center; no rotation or scaling, just translation; components don't overlap post-shift (but code doesn't check/prevent).
 * All training examples passed, implying rules capture core alignment for those cases (likely simple shifts), but test may reveal edge cases like multiple components or clipping.
 * Consider component colors: preserved exactly, including the special; bg % dim for overrides uses background value directly (e.g., 8%20=8).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return 0
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for isolating components; works in all cases.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    rows_n = len(g)
    cols_n = len(g[0])
    visited = set()
    components = []
    dirs: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows_n):
        for j in range(cols_n):
            if (i, j) not in visited and g[i][j] != bg:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited.add((i, j))
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y, g[x][y]))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows_n and 0 <= ny < cols_n and (nx, ny) not in visited and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited.add((nx, ny))
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder is robust for 4-connected regions; includes position and color; skips bg; helpful for all extractions.)

```python
def get_special(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return -1, -1, -1
    color_count = Counter(col for _, _, col in component)
    singleton_colors = [col for col, cnt in color_count.items() if cnt == 1]
    if len(singleton_colors) != 1:
        return -1, -1, -1
    s = singleton_colors[0]
    for r, c, col in component:
        if col == s:
            return r, c, s
    return -1, -1, -1
```
(Key for identifying anchor cell; strict singleton check ensures valid "special"; returns -1 on failure to skip invalid components.)

```python
def get_bounds(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _, _ in component]
    cs = [c for _, c, _ in component]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Useful for computing component dimensions; simple min/max; used in shift decisions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of background detection, component extraction, special cell identification, and conditional shifting.
 * Worked: Component finding and special detection logic correctly isolated and anchored regions in training cases; shifting rules (tall/wide, overrides, nudge) aligned elements properly for those inputs.
 * Didn't work (or unknown): No failures in training, but the attempt lacks handling for overlapping post-shift components, rotation, or non-rectangular alignments; single attempt, so no iteration on failures yet.
 * The main program integrates all functions well but hardcodes "9 -" targets (subtle puzzle canvas size?); skips small/invalid components correctly.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant and functional (none broken, though shifting could be refined for clipping visualization).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x20 grid (inferred from row lists of 20 elements each, 14 rows listed) with mostly 8 (bg) and scattered non-bg cells (e.g., 4s, 6s, 3s, 2s); components appear shifted right/down compared to a mental "original" (not provided, but assuming standard input has left/top placements).
 * It makes partial sense: Visible structures like vertical 3-6-3 lines on right (rows 1-3, cols 18-19), a 2 in row 3 col 6, scattered 4s/6s in top-left/mid, and bottom 4/2 placements; looks like repositioned blobs (e.g., a "tall" component shifted horizontally, wide ones vertically).
 * Does not look fully correct (speculation based on rules): Expected more centralized alignments (e.g., specials near col 9-10 or row 9-10 per "9 - (dim//2)"), but test has elements near edges (e.g., 3s at col 19, 2 at row 12 col 0); possible clipping lost cells (e.g., if dx/dy pushed out); differences include uneven spacing (e.g., row 2 has 6-4-4-4 cluster not tightly bound) and potential missed special (unknown without original input); bg % dim overrides may have misaligned wide/tall components (e.g., 8%20=8 targets col 8, but some are at 18+).
 * Overall, test output demonstrates manipulation but likely incorrect in precise positioning (e.g., too right-heavy; expected more balanced after shifts); unknown exact expected without target, but mismatches subtle nudge/override application.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to identify and manipulate "objects" (connected groups of non-background cells) by translating them to specific target positions on the grid, guided by rules involving the grid's overall dimensions (tall vs. wide), the object's aspect ratio, a "special" anchor cell (a unique singleton color within the object), and the background color for overrides in positioning. The output is a modified grid with objects moved (erased from original positions and placed at new ones, without overlapping or going out of bounds).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all manipulations treat non-background cells as part of potential objects.
 * Objects are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of non-background cells; single-cell objects are ignored for movement.
 * Each object must have exactly one "special" cell: a color that appears only once in the entire object (singleton); if not exactly one, the object is skipped (no movement).
 * Object bounds are computed as min/max row/col to determine its height (comp_h) and width (comp_w).
 * Grid orientation matters: if tall (h > w), objects move horizontally (dx only); if wide (h <= w), move vertically (dy only, with a potential -1 dx adjustment if the special row is below target and no override).
 * Target position is based on centering: for tall grid, target column is 9 - (w // 2); for wide, target row is 9 - (h // 2). But overrides apply if object is extremely elongated (comp_w > 2 * comp_h for horizontal override, or comp_h > 2 * comp_w for vertical), setting target to bg % dimension (bg modulo grid width/height).
 * Translation is relative to the special cell's position: dy/dx = target - special_pos; entire object shifts rigidly by this vector, but only cells landing in-bounds are placed (original positions set to bg).
 * Subtlety: The "9 -" in targets suggests a possible fixed assumption about grid size (e.g., 20x20 or similar, but code uses actual h/w); this might be puzzle-specific and could break on varying sizes—ensure it generalizes.
 * Overlap handling is implicit (new cells overwrite, but since objects are processed sequentially and originals erased, overlaps might occur if not careful; code doesn't prevent inter-object overlaps).
 * Edge case: Empty grid or all-bg returns unchanged; components with no special or <=1 cell are skipped.
 * Potential miss: The dx -=1 adjustment in wide case (if sr < target_r and not override) seems like a heuristic for alignment—verify if it's always needed or puzzle-specific (e.g., for shifting left in certain configs).
 * Color preservation: Moved cells keep their original colors; no rotation, scaling, or merging.
 * Connectivity post-move: Not enforced; objects might disconnect if partial (out-of-bounds), but puzzle likely assumes full in-bounds moves.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Identifies the dominant background color reliably; essential for isolating objects.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    if h == 0 or w == 0:
        return []
    visited = set()
    components = []
    dirs: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if (i, j) not in visited and g[i][j] != bg:
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited.add((i, j))
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y, g[x][y]))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and (nx, ny) not in visited and g[nx][ny] != bg:
                            visited.add((nx, ny))
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(component)
    return components
```
(Extracts 4-connected components as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; uses DFS via stack for efficiency; core for object detection.)

```python
def get_special(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return -1, -1, -1
    color_count = Counter(col for _, _, col in component)
    singleton_colors = [col for col, cnt in color_count.items() if cnt == 1]
    if len(singleton_colors) != 1:
        return -1, -1, -1
    s = singleton_colors[0]
    for r, c, col in component:
        if col == s:
            return r, c, s
    return -1, -1, -1
```
(Finds the unique singleton color cell as the translation anchor; skips if not exactly one—key for determining movement pivot.)

```python
def get_bounds(component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not component:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _, _ in component]
    cs = [c for _, c, _ in component]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(Computes min/max row/col for object dimensions; simple but crucial for aspect ratio checks and overrides.)

```python
def compute_translation(sr: int, sc: int, comp_h: int, comp_w: int, h: int, w: int, bg: int, is_tall: bool) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    dy = 0
    dx = 0
    if is_tall:
        target_c = 9 - (w // 2)
        override = comp_w > 2 * comp_h
        if override:
            target_c = bg % w
        dx = target_c - sc
    else:
        target_r = 9 - (h // 2)
        override = comp_h > 2 * comp_w
        if override:
            target_r = bg % h
        dy = target_r - sr
        dx = 0
        if sr < target_r and not override:
            dx -= 1
    return dy, dx
```
(Encapsulates the translation logic, including tall/wide distinction, centering, aspect overrides with bg modulo, and the subtle dx adjustment; central to the puzzle rules but may need tuning for the "9 -" constant.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying background (likely 8 in many cases), extracting components, finding specials, and applying translations with overrides, resulting in expected outputs.
 * What worked: Component detection and special cell identification are robust (passed training); translation logic captured core rules like tall/wide orientation and aspect overrides.
 * What didn't work: The "9 -" in target calculations assumes a specific centering (e.g., for 20-unit grids?), which might not generalize if grid sizes vary; the dx -=1 adjustment in wide cases is heuristic and could be incorrect for some configs (unknown if it failed training, but worth verifying).
 * Skipped single-cell or non-singleton objects correctly, avoiding unnecessary moves.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this one demonstrates solid understanding of object extraction and movement; unhelpful elements include none— all functions are relevant, though compute_translation's hardcoded "9" feels brittle.
 * Function `program` integrates everything well but processes components sequentially without overlap prevention, which might cause issues if objects collide post-move (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 14x20 grid (inferred from lines) with mostly 8s (likely bg), scattered non-8 cells (e.g., 4s, 6s, 3s, 2s) forming what look like moved objects: e.g., a cluster of 4s/6s in top-left/mid, 3s on right edge, 2s at bottom.
 * It appears to reflect successful translations: e.g., vertical/horizontal shifts of small components (like the 3-pair on right, possibly moved down; 2s at (3,6) and bottom row); bg=8 dominates, and no obvious out-of-bounds artifacts.
 * However, it does not look fully correct without the input grid for comparison—e.g., the top rows have irregular 4/6/3 placements that might not align with expected centering (e.g., if grid is wide h=14<w=20, vertical moves to row ~9 -7=2, but clusters are at rows 0-3); the override using bg%w (8%20=8) might explain some positions, but the dx-=1 could misalign horizontally.
 * Specific differences: Expected output should have all objects fully translated without remnants (code erases originals, so clean), but without input, hard to confirm—e.g., if input had a tall object overridden to col 8, but output shows spread 4s/6s not centered there; the bottom 2s at (12,0) and (12,19) look symmetric but might be unintended splits.
 * Overall, the test output makes partial sense (plausible moves, no crashes), but likely incorrect in precise positioning (e.g., the "9 -" might be wrong for h=14/w=20, leading to off-center targets like row 2 instead of true center ~6-7); it's different from ideal by potentially misapplying the adjustment or override, resulting in non-centered clusters.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) where the goal is to identify distinct connected objects (non-background components), locate a "special" cell within each object (the position of a color that appears only once in that object), and translate the entire object rigidly so that the special cell aligns to a calculated target position based on grid dimensions, object size, shape, and orientation rules, while preserving the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the entire grid; all operations ignore it for connectivity.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) groups of non-background cells; diagonals do not count.
 * Each component must have exactly one singleton color (appears exactly once); if not, skip processing that component—no special cell means no translation.
 * Translation is a rigid shift (same dy, dx for all cells in the component); cells shifted out of bounds are discarded, originals are cleared to background.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > cols (tall), translation is primarily horizontal; if cols >= rows (wide), primarily vertical; special cases for very tall/narrow objects (height > 2*width) adjust vertical target using bg % rows.
 * Target position calculation uses "9 - dimension//2" as a central-ish offset (e.g., for size 20, 9-10= -1? Wait, seems like aiming for index 4 or similar, but code uses 9 - //2 which for even dims gives odd results—potential off-by-one subtlety).
 * For non-tall grids, additional adjustments if special_r < target (dx -=1), but only if not special_case.
 * Size==1 components don't move (dy=dx=0).
 * Subtleties: Ensure visited set prevents revisiting; stack-based DFS for component extraction; bounds calculation uses min/max rows/cols of component cells.
 * Easy to miss: Singleton must be unique (len(singleton_colors)==1), not just any rare color; translation applies to all cells including the special one; overlapping after shifts isn't handled (may overwrite, but puzzle likely assumes no overlap).
 * Components are processed independently in order found (top-left to bottom-right), so order might affect overlaps if any.
 * Grid can be irregular but assumed rectangular; empty grid returns as-is.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully identified background, extracted components via DFS, found singleton special cells, computed bounds, and applied translations based on tall/wide logic with special cases.
 * Worked perfectly for all three training examples (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of component detection, singleton identification, and basic translation rules.
 * get_translation function handles size=1 correctly (no move), tall vs. wide orientation, and special_case for disproportionate heights, but the "9 - //2" target formula may be empirically tuned—worked for training but could be off-by-one for certain dims.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (find_background, find_components, get_special, get_bounds, get_translation) are essential and correct for the puzzle mechanics.
 * Potential subtlety missed: The additional dx -=1 adjustment in non-tall, non-special_case when r < target may not always align as intended, but it passed training so likely correct there.
 * Component clearing and placing in new_grid preserves colors accurately; no overlaps handled explicitly, but assuming puzzle avoids them.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 14x20 grid (inferred from row lengths) with background 8 dominant, and visible shifts of components: e.g., clusters of 4's, 6's, 3's, 2's appear repositioned (like a vertical stack of 3's on the right, horizontal 4's in top-middle, scattered 6's and 2's moved downward/leftward).
 * It makes sense overall as it follows the program's logic—components are cleared and replanted without distortion, non-bg cells remain connected post-shift, and bg fills originals—but without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify if translations are precisely correct (e.g., did special singletons land at intended targets like row 4 or col 4?).
 * Potential issue: The output shows some components partially truncated (e.g., edge 4's or 3's might be cut off if shifts went out-of-bounds), which matches code but could be unintended if puzzle expects full preservation; also, the right-edge vertical 3's look like a tall component shifted right, but if grid is wide (20>14), vertical targets should dominate—seems plausible but the "9 - 14//2 = 9-7=2" target might misalign specials.
 * Differences from expected: Assuming standard rules, the scattered 2's (e.g., at [3,6]=2, [11,12]=2, [12,0]=2, [12,19]=2) suggest multiple small components moved independently, which is correct, but the large top-left 4/6 cluster looks partially shifted left/up, potentially overlapping or not centering the singleton properly—it's different from a "clean" central alignment one might expect, indicating possible tweak needed in target calc for wide grids or special_case.
 * Overall, the test output demonstrates the program's mechanics working (no broken components, colors preserved) but may not be fully correct if the puzzle expects stricter centering (e.g., target=4 or dim//2 directly, not 9-//2); it's close but subtly off in positions compared to mental simulation of rules.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 12:03:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing shapes or symbols, where the goal is to identify small connected components (blobs) of rare non-background values and shift them horizontally or vertically towards a central target axis (column or row) to align them, likely simulating some kind of centering or gravitational pull in a puzzle like "align the icons" or "sort the blobs." The background is the most frequent number, and movements are based on anchors from singleton components or the grid's center, with orientation determining the shift direction.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is always the most common number in the flattened grid; everything else is treated as foreground, but only "specials" (values with 1-4 occurrences total) are candidates for movement—ignore larger groups.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) on non-bg cells; components can include mixed values, but shifts are keyed on the positions of a specific special value 's' within them.
 * Orientation: The code assumes "horizontal" if height > width (tall grid means horizontal shifts?), but this may be inverted—shifts should align to the longer dimension (e.g., wide grid shifts columns to center row). Subtle: for vertical shifts, there's a conditional dx -=1 if num_singles >0, len(comp)>1, and ref[0] < target, which seems like a hack for asymmetry but fails in some cases.
 * Target calculation: If no singletons, use grid center (w//2 or h//2); else, use the min position (top-left-most singleton) as anchor for target col/row. This persists across specials via current_target. Subtle: Singles are components of size 1, but only for the current special 's'? No, components are full non-bg, but singles are checked on full comp size==1.
 * Shifting: For each component of a special 's', find the min position of 's' cells in it (leftmost col or topmost row), compute shift to target, apply uniform dx/dy to all cells in comp (preserving values). Erase old positions to bg first. Subtle: Only shift if s_in exists; out-of-bounds cells are dropped (not wrapped). Process specials in order of (count[s], s) ascending, so smaller/rarer first.
 * Potential issues: Mixing values in components can cause unintended merges/splits; the dx -=1 hack may over/under-shift in asymmetric cases; target persistence might misalign later specials; no rotation or diagonal handling; assumes no overlapping after shifts (but collisions aren't resolved).
 * Easy to miss: Components are found per special but include all non-bg (so a component might have multiple specials); singles are full comp size==1, not just s count==1; grid may not be square, affecting is_horizontal; after shifts, new components aren't re-evaluated (one-pass per special).
 * Across attempts: Need to handle cases where singles are on one side (pull to center without bias); ensure shifts don't create new bg holes incorrectly; verify orientation—train 2 expected seems vertically aligned, but generated is messy.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
from collections import Counter, deque

def get_component(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, bg: int, height: int, width: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Find the connected component of non-background cells starting from (start_r, start_c) using 4-connectivity."""
    queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])
    visited = set([(start_r, start_c)])
    component = set()
    dirs = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        component.add((r, c))
        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and g[nr][nc] != bg and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(This BFS-based component finder is essential and correct for extracting 4-connected blobs of non-bg cells; reuse it.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Full program body as provided; core logic for bg detection, specials sorting, component extraction per special, target calc from singles/center, and uniform shifting.
```
(The main program structure is helpful but buggy in target/ shift logic; keep the Counter for bg/specials, s_pos_set for starting points, and old_cells dict for preserving values during shift.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handles simple cases (train 1 and 3 pass), demonstrating core component extraction and basic centering.
 * Failed on train 2: Generated output has first 5 rows all 8's (erased everything prematurely?), row 6 has 3's shifted left but incomplete, row 7 has isolated 3's and 8's, row 8 has 1's and 3's misplaced (e.g., 1 at (8,0) but expected none there), row 9 has 3's but no 1's where expected, row 10 has 3's intact but 4's missing. Expected has 3's forming a clearer shape in rows 2-4, 1's in row 5 cols 0,5,9,14, 4's in row 6 and below, and a 6 in row 9 col 0—differences suggest over-shifting/erasing of mixed components or wrong target (e.g., 1's and 4's not aligned to same center).
 * The dx -=1 adjustment in vertical mode caused under-shift for multi-cell comps above target in train 2 (unknown why, but it broke 1's and 4's positions).
 * Specials processing order (by count then value) worked for trains 1/3 but misordered shifts in train 2, causing later specials (e.g., 1's) to overwrite or misalign.
 * Component finding is solid (no misses noted), but uniform shift on mixed-value comps lost separation (e.g., 1's detached from 3's in generated row 8).
 * Target from min-singleton worked in simple cases but failed when singles are asymmetric (train 2 expected pulls to col ~4-5, but generated seems centered wrong).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; get_component is reliable, but the full shift logic needs refinement for asymmetry and persistence.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have partially shifted components but created a jumbled, non-aligned mess (e.g., 6's in rows 1-3 cols 4-6 are somewhat centered but 4's in row 2 col 5 and row 3 cols 14-16 are scattered; 2's are isolated in row 4 col 7, row 7 col 8, row 8 col 2, row 13 col 13, row 14 col 20—suggesting incomplete pulls; 3's in rows 7-11 cols 18-20 form a shape but not centered (grid width ~20, center ~10); 4's in rows 6-10 cols 5-11 are clustered but overlapping/erased oddly). Expected should align all small blobs (2's,3's,4's,6's—counts <=4?) to a central column (since width>height? ~20x14, horizontal), e.g., pulling left-side 2's rightward without scattering, and vertical 3's to center row ~7; differences include extra 8's where shapes should be solid, dropped out-of-bounds cells (e.g., bottom 3's clipped?), and no resolution for potential collisions—looks like train 2 failure repeated (wrong target or over-shift). To handle test, fix dx hack, re-evaluate components after each special, and use median position for target instead of min-single.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 12:03:34] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties that appear **in every train example** (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to patterns where one property or component demonstrably affects or relates to another in a repeatable way across all cases, without assuming causation or solving the overall puzzle. I focused solely on direct comparisons of properties (color, holes, bbox coordinates, pixels) between corresponding elements in inputs and outputs. No high-level interpretations or irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., unchanged single elements without impact on others) are included. If a potential connection was not observable in all three examples, it is excluded or noted as unknown.

Interactions are described as "A → B" to indicate how property/component A consistently relates to or affects B (e.g., via transformation or dependency). Only rigid, non-deforming changes (like translation) are noted where consistent.

1. **Large background component (high-pixel count shape, e.g., Blue/Maroon/Green with bbox spanning full canvas) → Small shapes' bbox (position)**  
   - The background's fixed bbox (unchanged min/max x/y across input/output) serves as a reference frame for translating small shapes (1-11 pixels). Small shapes' bbox coordinates shift relative to the background's edges, but never exceed or alter the background's overall span. Consistent in all examples: no small shape moves outside the background's bbox, implying positional constraint by the background.

2. **Small shapes' pixels (area) ↔ Bbox extent (width/height derived from min/max x/y)**  
   - Pixels remain identical for each small shape (no area loss/gain), and bbox extent (delta x = max_x - min_x; delta y = max_y - min_y) stays constant, indicating rigid translation without scaling, rotation, or deformation. This holds for all small multi-pixel shapes (e.g., 4-11 pixels) in all examples. Holes within small shapes also remain unchanged (0 or small fixed number), preserving internal structure during movement.

3. **Small shapes' color → Bbox translation direction/orientation**  
   - Shapes of the same color (e.g., all Yellow, all Blue, all Red/Green/Maroon/Pink variants) undergo translation in the same primary dimension (x or y) relative to the background. In taller canvases (height > width, as in trains 1 and 3), same-color small shapes translate primarily in x (horizontal alignment). In wider canvases (width > height, as in train 2), they translate primarily in y (vertical alignment). No color changes occur; translation preserves color identity.

4. **Background holes → Small shapes' bbox (overlay positioning)**  
   - The background's holes (enclosed voids) correlate with small shapes' final bbox positions, as small shapes are translated to overlap or adjoin the background's interior (within its bbox but not altering its pixels). In all examples, post-translation small shapes occupy positions inside the background's span, potentially interacting with holes via overlay. However, the effect on hole count is unknown (decreases in train 1, unchanged in trains 2 and 3—insufficient consistency to explain the transformation).

5. **Position (bbox y-range for vertical stacks; x-range for horizontal spreads) → Color-specific grouping**  
   - Elements in similar initial y-ranges (train 1: vertical tiers ~y3-4, y13-17; train 3: tiers ~y3-6, y10-12, y16-18) or x-ranges (train 2: horizontal spread ~x4-6, x8-17) group by color and translate together as clusters. For example, clustered Blue/Yellow/Maroon in upper/lower tiers (trains 1 and 3) or left/right spreads (train 2) maintain relative y/x offsets within the cluster during translation, preserving group cohesion relative to the background.

### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **No other consistent interactions identified**: For example, no reliable color → holes effect (holes only change for background in one case), no position → color change, and no hole count → movement magnitude (shifts vary: +3/-1 in x for train 1, -3/+1 in y for train 2, +2/-2 in x for train 3). Pixel counts never interact with other properties beyond preserving shape integrity.
- **Unknown transformations**: The exact magnitude or target coordinate of translations (e.g., why x=5 in train 1, y=4 in train 2, x=4 in train 3) cannot be explained from the data alone—appears dependent on unobservable visual factors like hole locations or canvas aspect ratio, but not consistently quantifiable here.
- **Excluded elements**: Isolated unchanged elements (e.g., top Red in train 3, edge Pinks in train 2) have no observed interactions. Background color varies (Blue/Maroon/Green) but does not consistently affect others.
- No analysis of test inputs, as the task focuses on consistent patterns from train examples only.

[2025-10-02 12:06:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train input/output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties that appear **in every train example** (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to patterns where one property or component demonstrably affects or relates to another in a repeatable way across all cases, without assuming causation or solving the overall puzzle. I focused solely on direct comparisons of properties (color, holes, bbox coordinates, pixels) between corresponding elements in inputs and outputs. No high-level interpretations or irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., unchanged single elements without impact on others) are included. If a potential connection was not observable in all three examples, it is excluded or noted as unknown.

Interactions are described as "A → B" to indicate how property/component A consistently relates to or affects B (e.g., via transformation or dependency). Only rigid, non-deforming changes (like translation) are noted where consistent.

1. **Large background component (high-pixel count shape, e.g., Blue/Maroon/Green with bbox spanning full canvas) → Small shapes' bbox (position)**  
   - The background's fixed bbox (unchanged min/max x/y across input/output) serves as a reference frame for translating small shapes (1-11 pixels). Small shapes' bbox coordinates shift relative to the background's edges, but never exceed or alter the background's overall span. Consistent in all examples: no small shape moves outside the background's bbox, implying positional constraint by the background.

2. **Small shapes' pixels (area) ↔ Bbox extent (width/height derived from min/max x/y)**  
   - Pixels remain identical for each small shape (no area loss/gain), and bbox extent (delta x = max_x - min_x; delta y = max_y - min_y) stays constant, indicating rigid translation without scaling, rotation, or deformation. This holds for all small multi-pixel shapes (e.g., 4-11 pixels) in all examples. Holes within small shapes also remain unchanged (0 or small fixed number), preserving internal structure during movement.

3. **Small shapes' color → Bbox translation direction/orientation**  
   - Shapes of the same color (e.g., all Yellow, all Blue, all Red/Green/Maroon/Pink variants) undergo translation in the same primary dimension (x or y) relative to the background. In taller canvases (height > width, as in trains 1 and 3), same-color small shapes translate primarily in x (horizontal alignment). In wider canvases (width > height, as in train 2), they translate primarily in y (vertical alignment). No color changes occur; translation preserves color identity.

4. **Background holes → Small shapes' bbox (overlay positioning)**  
   - The background's holes (enclosed voids) correlate with small shapes' final bbox positions, as small shapes are translated to overlap or adjoin the background's interior (within its bbox but not altering its pixels). In all examples, post-translation small shapes occupy positions inside the background's span, potentially interacting with holes via overlay. However, the effect on hole count is unknown (decreases in train 1, unchanged in trains 2 and 3—insufficient consistency to explain the transformation).

5. **Position (bbox y-range for vertical stacks; x-range for horizontal spreads) → Color-specific grouping**  
   - Elements in similar initial y-ranges (train 1: vertical tiers ~y3-4, y13-17; train 3: tiers ~y3-6, y10-12, y16-18) or x-ranges (train 2: horizontal spread ~x4-6, x8-17) group by color and translate together as clusters. For example, clustered Blue/Yellow/Maroon in upper/lower tiers (trains 1 and 3) or left/right spreads (train 2) maintain relative y/x offsets within the cluster during translation, preserving group cohesion relative to the background.

### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **No other consistent interactions identified**: For example, no reliable color → holes effect (holes only change for background in one case), no position → color change, and no hole count → movement magnitude (shifts vary: +3/-1 in x for train 1, -3/+1 in y for train 2, +2/-2 in x for train 3). Pixel counts never interact with other properties beyond preserving shape integrity.
- **Unknown transformations**: The exact magnitude or target coordinate of translations (e.g., why x=5 in train 1, y=4 in train 2, x=4 in train 3) cannot be explained from the data alone—appears dependent on unobservable visual factors like hole locations or canvas aspect ratio, but not consistently quantifiable here.
- **Excluded elements**: Isolated unchanged elements (e.g., top Red in train 3, edge Pinks in train 2) have no observed interactions. Background color varies (Blue/Maroon/Green) but does not consistently affect others.
- No analysis of test inputs, as the task focuses on consistent patterns from train examples only.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 12:28:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels where the goal is to transform the input grid by translating connected components of non-background elements according to inferred rules based on the canvas aspect ratio, background color, and special "marker" colors (those appearing exactly 4 times, with the highest-numbered as the primary marker). The transformation prioritizes shifting components along a primary axis (x for tall canvases, y for wide) to align markers with a target position, while optionally counter-shifting the secondary axis if minor markers are present.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent pixel value (e.g., 8 in examples), and all transformations preserve it while moving non-background components without rotation, scaling, or color changes.
 * Special colors are non-background colors with exactly 4 pixels total; the main special is the highest-numbered one, used for primary alignment, while others are "minors" that trigger secondary shifts only if present in a component and primary delta > 0.
 * Canvas aspect ratio determines primary direction: tall (h > w) uses x-translation (horizontal shift, primary coord is column y), wide uses y-translation (vertical shift, primary coord is row x); target position is 9 - (dim // 2) along the primary dimension, suggesting a 10-unit scale or centering bias.
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right), color-agnostic (groups any adjacent non-bg pixels), and each is shifted independently; shifts are calculated per-component based on the min primary position of main/minor markers, with secondary delta = -primary delta only for components with minors.
 * Subtlety: If no main marker in a component, fall back to min position of any minor as primary; components without any specials get no shift (delta=0). Clipping occurs (pixels shifted out of bounds are lost), and overlaps are not handled (last write wins, but rare).
 * Easy to miss: Primary coord flips based on direction (y for x-dir, x for y-dir); assumes at most one minor per component for simplicity, but takes min if multiple; grid dimensions are fixed, no resizing.
 * All training examples (1-3) passed, implying rules capture core shifting for simple cases (e.g., single components with main markers), but test may involve multiple components, minors, or edge cases like partial marker presence.
 * Considerations: No rotation or mirroring; colors stay the same; empty components or all-bg grids return unchanged; potential for multiple mains/minors across grid, but per-component processing handles separation.

                        nx = x + dx

                components.append(component)
    return components
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt shown; it successfully solved all three training examples by correctly identifying bg=8, specials (e.g., main=6 or similar with 4 pixels), components, and applying shifts (e.g., horizontal for tall grids, aligning min marker pos to target like 4 or 5).
 * What worked: Component extraction and per-component shifting logic captured core rules, including direction-based coord swaps and conditional secondary shifts for minors; background preservation and clipping handled edge cases in training.
 * What didn't work: In the test input, the output shows scattered shifts (e.g., 6's and 4's moved leftward in top rows, 2 and 3 clusters partially translated), but it appears incomplete—e.g., bottom 2's and 3's seem under-shifted or unprocessed, and a 6 in row 9 col 4 is isolated without clear alignment to a target ~4-5; multiple components (e.g., separate 4/6 groups, 2's, 3's) may not all use the same main (likely 6), causing inconsistent deltas.
 * Subtle issue: Fallback to minor min-pos works for training but may misalign in test if components lack main but have overlapping minors; secondary delta=-primary only if has_minor and delta_p>0, but test output shows some vertical shifts (dy) that don't match this (e.g., 3's cluster moved down without clear counter-shift).
 * Function `get_special_colors` is helpful and correct (identifies mains/minors by count==4, max for main), but could miss if test has >1 color with 4+ pixels or non-exact 4.
 * Function `get_delta_for_component` is mostly helpful but subtly broken for multi-minor cases (takes min, assuming rare); in test, it likely under-shifts components without main (delta_p=0), leaving e.g., isolated 2's or 3's unmoved.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core understanding (components + marker-based shift) since training passed; however, test reveals gaps in handling diverse components (e.g., no main in some, like 3's or 2's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: bg=8 preserved, non-bg clusters (e.g., top 6/4 group shifted left ~2-3 cols, aligning some 4's/6's toward col 3-4; mid 2 and bottom 3/6 seem partially translated horizontally, consistent with tall canvas x-dir and target~4).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several components appear under-shifted or unshifted (e.g., row 12-13 2's at edges unchanged, suggesting delta=0 for no-marker components; 3's in rows 6-9 shifted down ~1 but not counter-left, mismatching secondary rule; isolated 6 in row 9 col 4 and 2 in row 3 col 6 seem orphaned without component grouping).
 * Differences from expected: Expected output should align ALL marker-containing components (main=6? with 4 pixels, minors=4/3/2?) to primary target (e.g., min col~4 for x-dir), with uniform deltas per type, but generated has inconsistent positions (e.g., top 6's at cols 3-5 ok, but lower 6/3 at cols 17-19 unchanged, indicating missed components or wrong delta calc); vertical positions for some (e.g., 4's in row 2 col 13-15) suggest erroneous dy when dx=0.
 * The output is different in that it clips some pixels (e.g., potential lost 4's off-left) but retains others unexpectedly (e.g., row 0 6's at 3-5 match shift, but row 10 4 at col 0 unshifted?); unknown why 3's cluster moves vertically without primary x-alignment—possibly bug in direction swap or has_minor detection.
 * Overall, test output demonstrates partial rule application (some shifts work) but fails on multi-component diversity and minor handling, so it does not fully match expected clean alignments across the grid.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 12:28:52] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties and components that show direct effects or dependencies in all cases, without assuming or forcing unobservable links (e.g., no semantic meanings like "balance" or "symmetry" are inferred, as they are not directly identifiable from the data). Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated pixels with no positional change or relation to others) are excluded. Inconsistent effects (e.g., background hole changes, which occur only in train 1) are not included. The exact mechanism of positional transformation (e.g., specific delta calculations) cannot be explained from the data without solving the puzzle, so it is noted as unknown where applicable.

#### 1. **Background Component and Small Components (Positional Interaction via Aspect Ratio)**
   - **Components Involved**: 
     - Background: The single large component (pixels >100, bbox=[0,0,W,H] encompassing the entire grid; color varies—Blue in train 1, Maroon in train 2, Green in train 3).
     - Small components: All other elements (pixels ≤13, small bbox; colors vary—e.g., Maroon, Yellow, Blue in train 1; Green, Blue, Yellow, Maroon, Pink in train 2; Red, Blue in train 3).
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - The background's bbox dimensions (width W = max_x - min_x, height H = max_y - min_y) affect the **direction** of positional transformation for **all** small components.
       - If H > W (tall background: trains 1 and 3), small components translate only horizontally (x-coordinates shift, y-coordinates fixed; no y-movement).
       - If W > H (wide background: train 2), small components translate primarily vertically (y-coordinates shift, with possible minor x-shifts of -1 or 0).
     - The background's bbox remains completely fixed (no translation, no property changes except inconsistent hole count).
     - **Unknown**: The exact magnitude of translation (delta_x or delta_y) for small components cannot be explained; it consistently depends on each small component's initial position (bbox) relative to the background but follows no obvious arithmetic pattern identifiable without further solving.

#### 2. **Small Components' Intrinsic Properties (Self-Preservation Under Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: All small components (as defined above; background is unaffected by this).
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - Each small component's intrinsic properties (color, holes, pixels, bbox width = x2 - x1, bbox height = y2 - y1) are preserved exactly after transformation—no changes observed in any train example.
     - The initial position (bbox x1/y1) of each small component affects its output position (translated bbox), but only as a translation (no scaling, rotation, or merging); y1 fixed in tall backgrounds, x1 fixed or minimally shifted in wide backgrounds.
     - No interactions between small components themselves (e.g., no one's position affects another's; each translates independently based on its own initial position and the background's aspect ratio).
     - **Unknown**: Specific factors influencing translation magnitude (e.g., potential subtle role of color or holes in delta calculation) cannot be confirmed, as all small components (regardless of color or holes=0/1) undergo similar directional changes tied only to initial position and background aspect.

#### Excluded Observations (Not Consistent Across Every Example)
- Background holes: Change in train 1 (3→2) but unchanged in trains 2 and 3—no consistent interaction.
- Color-specific effects: No evidence that color affects movement direction or magnitude (all colors in a given train follow the same directional rule based on background aspect ratio).
- Hole count in small components: Always 0 or preserved (e.g., Green holes=1 in train 2), but too few non-zero cases to identify a consistent effect on movement.
- Pixel count or bbox size interactions: Preserved but do not appear to influence translation (e.g., no correlation with delta magnitude).

These are the only connections that are directly observable and hold in every train example. No higher-level puzzle logic (e.g., overall arrangement) is inferred or included.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 12:30:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties and components that show direct effects or dependencies in all cases, without assuming or forcing unobservable links (e.g., no semantic meanings like "balance" or "symmetry" are inferred, as they are not directly identifiable from the data). Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated pixels with no positional change or relation to others) are excluded. Inconsistent effects (e.g., background hole changes, which occur only in train 1) are not included. The exact mechanism of positional transformation (e.g., specific delta calculations) cannot be explained from the data without solving the puzzle, so it is noted as unknown where applicable.

#### 1. **Background Component and Small Components (Positional Interaction via Aspect Ratio)**
   - **Components Involved**: 
     - Background: The single large component (pixels >100, bbox=[0,0,W,H] encompassing the entire grid; color varies—Blue in train 1, Maroon in train 2, Green in train 3).
     - Small components: All other elements (pixels ≤13, small bbox; colors vary—e.g., Maroon, Yellow, Blue in train 1; Green, Blue, Yellow, Maroon, Pink in train 2; Red, Blue in train 3).
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - The background's bbox dimensions (width W = max_x - min_x, height H = max_y - min_y) affect the **direction** of positional transformation for **all** small components.
       - If H > W (tall background: trains 1 and 3), small components translate only horizontally (x-coordinates shift, y-coordinates fixed; no y-movement).
       - If W > H (wide background: train 2), small components translate primarily vertically (y-coordinates shift, with possible minor x-shifts of -1 or 0).
     - The background's bbox remains completely fixed (no translation, no property changes except inconsistent hole count).
     - **Unknown**: The exact magnitude of translation (delta_x or delta_y) for small components cannot be explained; it consistently depends on each small component's initial position (bbox) relative to the background but follows no obvious arithmetic pattern identifiable without further solving.

#### 2. **Small Components' Intrinsic Properties (Self-Preservation Under Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: All small components (as defined above; background is unaffected by this).
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - Each small component's intrinsic properties (color, holes, pixels, bbox width = x2 - x1, bbox height = y2 - y1) are preserved exactly after transformation—no changes observed in any train example.
     - The initial position (bbox x1/y1) of each small component affects its output position (translated bbox), but only as a translation (no scaling, rotation, or merging); y1 fixed in tall backgrounds, x1 fixed or minimally shifted in wide backgrounds.
     - No interactions between small components themselves (e.g., no one's position affects another's; each translates independently based on its own initial position and the background's aspect ratio).
     - **Unknown**: Specific factors influencing translation magnitude (e.g., potential subtle role of color or holes in delta calculation) cannot be confirmed, as all small components (regardless of color or holes=0/1) undergo similar directional changes tied only to initial position and background aspect.

#### Excluded Observations (Not Consistent Across Every Example)
- Background holes: Change in train 1 (3→2) but unchanged in trains 2 and 3—no consistent interaction.
- Color-specific effects: No evidence that color affects movement direction or magnitude (all colors in a given train follow the same directional rule based on background aspect ratio).
- Hole count in small components: Always 0 or preserved (e.g., Green holes=1 in train 2), but too few non-zero cases to identify a consistent effect on movement.
- Pixel count or bbox size interactions: Preserved but do not appear to influence translation (e.g., no correlation with delta magnitude).

These are the only connections that are directly observable and hold in every train example. No higher-level puzzle logic (e.g., overall arrangement) is inferred or included.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 12:42:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to transform an input grid by identifying the background color, extracting small connected components (non-background regions), determining target positions from single-cell markers of specific colors, and repositioning components to align a "special" (unique) cell within each component to its corresponding target, with adjustments based on grid orientation (tall vs. wide) and potential special cases for certain colors like 1.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most prevalent color in the grid, found via flood-fill to identify the largest connected region.
 * Components are 4-connected groups of non-background cells; only "small" components (implied to be non-background blobs, but code treats all non-bg connected regions as candidates) are processed, excluding the background itself.
 * Targets are derived from single-cell (size 1) non-background components, using their color as a key and their position (column for tall grids, row for wide grids) as the target coordinate.
 * For each component, identify a "special color" as the one that appears exactly once in the component and has a corresponding target; align the position of this special cell to the target by computing a delta shift (horizontal for tall grids, vertical for wide, with a special left-shift for color 1 in wide grids when delta_y > 0).
 * If no special color is found, no shift occurs (default delta 0,0).
 * Erasing and re-placing components must stay within grid bounds; out-of-bounds placements are ignored.
 * Grid orientation matters: tall (h > w) uses x-coordinates for targets and horizontal shifts; wide uses y-coordinates and vertical shifts.
 * Subtlety: Targets are collected only from size-1 components, and special color matching requires the color to be both unique in the component and present in targets.
 * Components are processed independently, and the output is a modified copy of the input grid with shifted components overlaid (potentially overwriting background or other areas, but code erases first).
 * Easy to miss: Special rule for color 1 in wide grids adds a -1 x-shift if delta_y > 0; also, flood-fill must mark visited to avoid re-processing.
 * All non-background cells are considered for components, but only those with a matching special color get shifted; others stay put.
 * Grid dimensions can vary, and empty rows/columns aren't handled specially beyond validation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Set
from collections import defaultdict

def get_grid_dimensions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        w = 0
    else:
        w = len(g[0])
    return h, w

def is_tall_grid(h: int, w: int) -> bool:
    return h > w

def get_directions() -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

def is_valid_position(y: int, x: int, h: int, w: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= y < h and 0 <= x < w

def flood_fill_same_color(g: List[List[int]], y: int, x: int, c: int, h: int, w: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> int:
    size = 0
    stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(y, x)]
    visited[y][x] = True
    while stack:
        cy, cx = stack.pop()
        size += 1
        for dy, dx in get_directions():
            ny, nx = cy + dy, cx + dx
            if is_valid_position(ny, nx, h, w) and not visited[ny][nx] and g[ny][nx] == c:
                visited[ny][nx] = True
                stack.append((ny, nx))
    return size
```
(This flood-fill is essential for identifying connected components and background; it's efficient with stack-based DFS.)

```python
def find_background_color(g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> int:
    visited = [[False for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
    max_size = 0
    bg_color = -1
    for start_y in range(h):
        for start_x in range(w):
            if not visited[start_y][start_x]:
                c = g[start_y][start_x]
                size = flood_fill_same_color(g, start_y, start_x, c, h, w, visited)
                if size > max_size:
                    max_size = size
                    bg_color = c
    return bg_color
```
(Helpful for reliably finding the dominant background color via largest same-color region.)

```python
def flood_fill_non_bg(g: List[List[int]], start_y: int, start_x: int, bg: int, h: int, w: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    component: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []
    stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(start_y, start_x)]
    visited[start_y][start_x] = True
    component.append((start_y, start_x, g[start_y][start_x]))
    while stack:
        cy, cx = stack.pop()
        for dy, dx in get_directions():
            ny, nx = cy + dy, cx + dx
            if is_valid_position(ny, nx, h, w) and not visited[ny][nx] and g[ny][nx] != bg:
                visited[ny][nx] = True
                stack.append((ny, nx))
                component.append((ny, nx, g[ny][nx]))
    return component
```
(Key for extracting non-background connected components, storing positions and colors; note it connects any non-bg, not just same-color.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but the code structure builds on standard flood-fill for components.
 * Successfully handled training examples 1-3 completely (all marked CORRECT), indicating core logic for background detection, component extraction, target identification, and shifting works for those cases.
 * Potential issue: Code assumes all non-bg components are "small" and processable, but if training had large non-small components, they might be ignored correctly; untested on cases with no special color (defaults to no shift, which seems right).
 * The special delta computation for color 1 (adding -1 x-shift in wide grids when delta_y > 0) was likely tuned from training data and worked there.
 * Visited tracking prevents double-processing, which is crucial and worked.
 * No major misses in training, but subtlety like out-of-bounds placement being ignored (via is_valid_position) ensured no crashes.
 * compute_color_counts and find_unique_special_color are helpful and correct for identifying the alignment point.
 * erase_component_positions before place_component avoids overlaps from original positions, which is essential and worked in training.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 14x20 grid (inferred from row lengths, e.g., first row has 20 elements), with mostly 8s (likely background) and scattered non-8 colors like 2,3,4,6.
 * It looks partially correct: Visible shifts in components, e.g., a cluster of 4s and 3s in top-right seems moved or aligned (rows 0-2 show 3s shifting rightward), and bottom components like 6s in rows 9-10 appear repositioned horizontally.
 * However, it does not fully match an expected ideal output (mentally simulating rules: assuming test input has similar structure to training, targets for colors like 3/4 should align single unique cells vertically/horizontally; here, some 3s in row 2 col 19-20 seem misaligned by 1-2 positions compared to potential targets in row 0-1, and a 2-6 cluster in row 3 appears not fully shifted left as expected for color 1 special case—unknown if input has color 1).
 * The output retains some original positions without erasure (e.g., lingering 4s in row 0 col 3-5 and row 2 col 3-5 suggest incomplete erasing for one component), differing from expectation where all processed components should be fully removed and replaced.
 * Bottom 6s (row 9-10) look correctly shifted right by ~1-2 columns to align with a potential target, but a isolated 4 in row 10 col 0 seems unprocessed (no special color?), which is expected but confirms default delta works.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (some alignments visible, no crashes), but differences in partial overlaps/unerased cells indicate a bug in component isolation or special color detection for at least one blob; it does not look fully correct, as expected output should have cleaner, exact alignments without residuals.

[2025-10-02 12:42:55] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of components and properties that show obvious interactions or effects on each other. Only those consistent across **every** train example are included (i.e., present and behaving the same way in train 1, 2, and 3). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., shapes with no position/ property change or connection to others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or inconsistent patterns (e.g., hole changes, which occur in train 1 but not 2 or 3) are inferred. Where a transformation or effect cannot be explained with an obvious, consistent rule, it is noted as unknown. No forced connections are made (e.g., no assumed semantic meaning for colors or shapes beyond the data).

#### 1. **Non-background shapes (all small and medium elements) ↔ Background large shape (high-pixel, full-bbox element starting at [0,0])**
   - **Components involved**: All listed shapes except the single large background (e.g., Blue in train 1, Maroon in train 2, Green in train 3; identified by pixels >100, bbox from [0,0] to canvas edge).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - **Position (bbox x/y) of non-background shapes → Potential effect on background holes**: The background's bbox, color, and pixels remain identical in input and output. Non-background shapes' positions always change relative to the fixed background, but this has no consistent effect on background holes (holes unchanged in trains 2 and 3; changed in train 1—unknown rule).
     - **Background position (fixed at [0,0] to edge) → Constrains non-background position transformations**: All non-background shapes transform their bbox relative to the fixed background edges, staying within the background's x/y bounds (no overflow or expansion observed). Specific transformation rule (e.g., shift direction/amount) unknown but consistent in occurring for every non-background shape.
   - **Consistency note**: Present in every example; background acts as a static "container" affecting all position changes indirectly via bounds.

#### 2. **1-pixel shapes (pixels=1, holes=0; various colors, e.g., Yellow, Blue, Red, Pink, Green) ↔ Their own bbox position**
   - **Components involved**: All 1-pixel elements (e.g., Yellow [2,4,2,4] in train 1, Blue [10,3,10,3] in train 2, Red [2,5,2,5] in train 3).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - **Position (bbox x/y) → Self-transformation**: Every 1-pixel shape changes its bbox position in the output (x or y or both shift; no shape stays identical in position). Color, holes=0, and pixels=1 remain unchanged. Shift amount/direction varies (e.g., right in some, up/down in others—unknown rule), but the effect (position always alters) is consistent.
     - No interaction with other 1-pixel shapes observed (they move independently, no consistent relative positioning).
   - **Consistency note**: Every train has multiple 1-pixel shapes, all of which exhibit this self-position change; no exceptions.

#### 3. **Medium shapes (pixels >1 and < background pixels, holes=0 or 1; various colors, e.g., Maroon/Yellow pairs in train 1, Green/Yellow in train 2, Blue/Green in train 3) ↔ Their own bbox position**
   - **Components involved**: Polyomino-like or rectangular forms (e.g., Maroon [1,3,3,4] pixels=5 in train 1, Green [4,4,6,7] pixels=9 in train 2, Blue [1,3,3,4] pixels=4 in train 3).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - **Position (bbox x/y) → Self-transformation**: Every medium shape changes its bbox in the output (x or y or both adjusted; width/height may stay similar but coordinates shift). Pixels and color remain unchanged; holes remain 0 in most cases (1→0 in one train 2 example—unknown). Transformation keeps the shape within background bounds. Specific rule unknown (e.g., no consistent shift vector).
   - **Consistency note**: Every train has multiple medium shapes, all showing bbox change; no static medium shapes.

#### 4. **Adjacent/embedded pairs (1-pixel or medium shape adjacent/within bbox of another medium shape) → Relative position transformation**
   - **Components involved**: Pairs where one shape's bbox overlaps or adjoins another in input (e.g., Yellow [2,4,2,4] embedded in Maroon [1,3,3,4] x/y in train 1; Yellow [2,2,2,5] overlapping y with Green [4,4,6,7] in train 2; Red [2,5,2,5] near Blue [1,3,3,4] in train 3).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - **Position of host shape (medium, outer bbox) → Position of embedded/adjacent shape (1-pixel or small medium)**: In every example, paired shapes maintain relative adjacency or embedding after transformation (e.g., embedded 1-pixel stays within host's new bbox; adjacent pair stays adjacent post-shift). Both transform positions together, but exact relative offset may adjust slightly (e.g., exact overlap preserved in some, minor snap in others—unknown rule). No color dependency (pairs vary: Maroon-Yellow, Green-Yellow, Blue-Red).
     - No effect on non-positional properties (e.g., no hole or pixel change from pairing).
   - **Consistency note**: Every train has at least one such pair in input, and the relative positioning is preserved post-transformation; isolated shapes move independently.

#### Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Hole count → Any effect**: Appears in background or occasional medium shapes but changes inconsistently (e.g., only in train 1 background and one train 2 Green); no clear connection to other properties or components across all examples—excluded.
- **Color → Movement or transformation**: Colors vary per puzzle (e.g., Yellow secondary in 1 and 2, but Blue in 3) with no consistent effect on position shifts, hole changes, or interactions—excluded as irrelevant to consistent connections.
- **Pixels → Position**: Pixels unchanged for all shapes, but no obvious effect on transformations (e.g., larger pixels don't consistently shift differently)—excluded.
- **Silhouette/edges → Movement**: Bbox changes suggest edge adjustments, but no consistent interaction (e.g., no uniform edge alignment rule across examples)—unknown and excluded.
- No consistent interactions involving creation/deletion of shapes (e.g., train 2 adds a Pink position, but not in others—excluded).
- Overall transformation rule for positions (e.g., why shifts occur to specific lines like x=5 in train 1 or y=4 in train 2) is unknown; only the fact of change and relative preservation is consistent.

This list captures only obvious, data-driven connections present in every train example. No broader puzzle mechanics are inferred.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 12:44:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of components and properties that show obvious interactions or effects on each other. Only those consistent across **every** train example are included (i.e., present and behaving the same way in train 1, 2, and 3). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., shapes with no position/ property change or connection to others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or inconsistent patterns (e.g., hole changes, which occur in train 1 but not 2 or 3) are inferred. Where a transformation or effect cannot be explained with an obvious, consistent rule, it is noted as unknown. No forced connections are made (e.g., no assumed semantic meaning for colors or shapes beyond the data).

#### 1. **Non-background shapes (all small and medium elements) ↔ Background large shape (high-pixel, full-bbox element starting at [0,0])**
   - **Components involved**: All listed shapes except the single large background (e.g., Blue in train 1, Maroon in train 2, Green in train 3; identified by pixels >100, bbox from [0,0] to canvas edge).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - **Position (bbox x/y) of non-background shapes → Potential effect on background holes**: The background's bbox, color, and pixels remain identical in input and output. Non-background shapes' positions always change relative to the fixed background, but this has no consistent effect on background holes (holes unchanged in trains 2 and 3; changed in train 1—unknown rule).
     - **Background position (fixed at [0,0] to edge) → Constrains non-background position transformations**: All non-background shapes transform their bbox relative to the fixed background edges, staying within the background's x/y bounds (no overflow or expansion observed). Specific transformation rule (e.g., shift direction/amount) unknown but consistent in occurring for every non-background shape.
   - **Consistency note**: Present in every example; background acts as a static "container" affecting all position changes indirectly via bounds.

#### 2. **1-pixel shapes (pixels=1, holes=0; various colors, e.g., Yellow, Blue, Red, Pink, Green) ↔ Their own bbox position**
   - **Components involved**: All 1-pixel elements (e.g., Yellow [2,4,2,4] in train 1, Blue [10,3,10,3] in train 2, Red [2,5,2,5] in train 3).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - **Position (bbox x/y) → Self-transformation**: Every 1-pixel shape changes its bbox position in the output (x or y or both shift; no shape stays identical in position). Color, holes=0, and pixels=1 remain unchanged. Shift amount/direction varies (e.g., right in some, up/down in others—unknown rule), but the effect (position always alters) is consistent.
     - No interaction with other 1-pixel shapes observed (they move independently, no consistent relative positioning).
   - **Consistency note**: Every train has multiple 1-pixel shapes, all of which exhibit this self-position change; no exceptions.

#### 3. **Medium shapes (pixels >1 and < background pixels, holes=0 or 1; various colors, e.g., Maroon/Yellow pairs in train 1, Green/Yellow in train 2, Blue/Green in train 3) ↔ Their own bbox position**
   - **Components involved**: Polyomino-like or rectangular forms (e.g., Maroon [1,3,3,4] pixels=5 in train 1, Green [4,4,6,7] pixels=9 in train 2, Blue [1,3,3,4] pixels=4 in train 3).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - **Position (bbox x/y) → Self-transformation**: Every medium shape changes its bbox in the output (x or y or both adjusted; width/height may stay similar but coordinates shift). Pixels and color remain unchanged; holes remain 0 in most cases (1→0 in one train 2 example—unknown). Transformation keeps the shape within background bounds. Specific rule unknown (e.g., no consistent shift vector).
   - **Consistency note**: Every train has multiple medium shapes, all showing bbox change; no static medium shapes.

#### 4. **Adjacent/embedded pairs (1-pixel or medium shape adjacent/within bbox of another medium shape) → Relative position transformation**
   - **Components involved**: Pairs where one shape's bbox overlaps or adjoins another in input (e.g., Yellow [2,4,2,4] embedded in Maroon [1,3,3,4] x/y in train 1; Yellow [2,2,2,5] overlapping y with Green [4,4,6,7] in train 2; Red [2,5,2,5] near Blue [1,3,3,4] in train 3).
   - **Interconnected properties**:
     - **Position of host shape (medium, outer bbox) → Position of embedded/adjacent shape (1-pixel or small medium)**: In every example, paired shapes maintain relative adjacency or embedding after transformation (e.g., embedded 1-pixel stays within host's new bbox; adjacent pair stays adjacent post-shift). Both transform positions together, but exact relative offset may adjust slightly (e.g., exact overlap preserved in some, minor snap in others—unknown rule). No color dependency (pairs vary: Maroon-Yellow, Green-Yellow, Blue-Red).
     - No effect on non-positional properties (e.g., no hole or pixel change from pairing).
   - **Consistency note**: Every train has at least one such pair in input, and the relative positioning is preserved post-transformation; isolated shapes move independently.

#### Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Hole count → Any effect**: Appears in background or occasional medium shapes but changes inconsistently (e.g., only in train 1 background and one train 2 Green); no clear connection to other properties or components across all examples—excluded.
- **Color → Movement or transformation**: Colors vary per puzzle (e.g., Yellow secondary in 1 and 2, but Blue in 3) with no consistent effect on position shifts, hole changes, or interactions—excluded as irrelevant to consistent connections.
- **Pixels → Position**: Pixels unchanged for all shapes, but no obvious effect on transformations (e.g., larger pixels don't consistently shift differently)—excluded.
- **Silhouette/edges → Movement**: Bbox changes suggest edge adjustments, but no consistent interaction (e.g., no uniform edge alignment rule across examples)—unknown and excluded.
- No consistent interactions involving creation/deletion of shapes (e.g., train 2 adds a Pink position, but not in others—excluded).
- Overall transformation rule for positions (e.g., why shifts occur to specific lines like x=5 in train 1 or y=4 in train 2) is unknown; only the fact of change and relative preservation is consistent.

This list captures only obvious, data-driven connections present in every train example. No broader puzzle mechanics are inferred.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
