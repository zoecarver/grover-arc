=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 22:46:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:01:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

# Existing count function is helpful for identifying singletons pre- and post-fill
def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

# Helpful for finding singleton positions after stem processing
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> dict:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 23:01:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

# Existing count function is helpful for identifying singletons pre- and post-fill
def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

# Helpful for finding singleton positions after stem processing
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> dict:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:09:17] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

[2025-09-30 23:09:17] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

# Existing count function is helpful for identifying singletons pre- and post-fill
def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

# Helpful for finding singleton positions after stem processing
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> dict:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

        while i < h:
            val = g[i][col]

            else:
                i += 1
    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10

**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    # Counts occurrences of each non-8 color; useful for identifying exactly 3 singletons.
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts
```

```python
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Maps each singleton color to its (row, col) position; essential for triggering position-based rules.
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    pos_dict: Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]] = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

```python
def find_stems(g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    # Finds vertical runs of 1s or 2s of length >=4; returns (start_row, end_row, col, type); key for horizontal fills after singletons.
    runs = []
    for col in range(w):
        i = 0
        while i < h:
            val = g[i][col]
            if val == 1 or val == 2:
                cl = val
                start_i = i
                i += 1
                while i < h and g[i][col] == cl:
                    i += 1
                length = i - start_i
                if length >= 4:
                    runs.append((start_i, i - 1, col, cl))
            else:
                i += 1
    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly identified singletons (e.g., in train1, s1=1,s2=2,s3=3) and their positions, enabling basic pattern triggering.
 * Successfully filled some top/bottom 3-column propagations (e.g., train1 top with 2-3-4? but mismatched colors; bottom with 2-3-1 correctly in parts).
 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 23:17:01] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs/outputs (and noting consistency requirements), only obvious, direct interactions or effects between elements are listed below. These are limited to patterns that appear in **both** train examples without exception. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon background without transformation ties) are excluded. No high-level puzzle interpretation or solution is attempted. Where a transformation or effect cannot be explained with visible consistency (e.g., exact mechanics of length/direction), it is noted as unknown. Semantic meanings (e.g., "pillars" or "caps") are not assumed unless tied to a property like position or adjacency.

1. **Multi-pixel colored blocks (pixels > 1, non-Maroon colors: Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Pink, Orange, Light Blue) ↔ Position and shape preservation**  
   - Effect: These blocks (vertical stacks, horizontal segments, or short bars) retain exact position (bbox), pixel count, and holes=0 in the output. No transformation or movement occurs.  
   - Interaction: Their fixed presence constrains adjacent Maroon reconfiguration (see #5), but no direct effect on other colored blocks.  
   - Consistency: Applies to all such blocks in both train inputs (e.g., Train 1: Red [18,1,18,6] pixels=6; Green [19,2,19,5] pixels=4; Train 2: Blue [14,2,22,2] pixels=9; Red [15,3,20,3] pixels=6). No exceptions.

2. **Single-pixel Yellow blocks (pixels=1, holes=0) ↔ No transformation**  
   - Effect: Preserved exactly as single pixels in the same position (bbox) in the output. No extension, movement, or size change.  
   - Interaction: Isolated from other elements; no observed effect on nearby colors or Maroon (e.g., no adjacency-triggered changes).  
   - Consistency: All Yellow singles in both trains follow this (e.g., Train 1: Yellow [19,6,19,6] pixels=1; Train 2: Yellow [14,3,14,3] pixels=1). Differs from non-Yellow singles (see #3).

3. **Single-pixel non-Yellow colored blocks (pixels=1, holes=0; colors: Pink, Blue, Orange, Green, Light Blue) ↔ Extension transformation**  
   - Effect: These are extended into larger rectangular blocks (increased pixels, adjusted bbox) in the output, typically forming lines (horizontal or vertical). Original position influences the extension's starting point.  
   - Interaction: Affects adjacent Maroon by overwriting/replacing pixels in the background to form the extension (Maroon pixel count decreases overall). Direction (horizontal/vertical) and length (e.g., to 2–17 pixels) are unknown and vary. No effect on preserved multi-pixel blocks.  
   - Consistency: Applies to all such singles in both trains (e.g., Train 1: Pink [28,19,28,19] → extended horizontal to pixels=5; Blue [13,25,13,25] → extended vertical to pixels=17; Train 2: Pink [19,0,19,0] → extended vertical to pixels=2; Green [0,1,0,1] → extended horizontal to pixels=5; Light Blue [0,5,0,5] → extended horizontal to pixels=5). Yellow singles excluded (see #2). No multi-pixel blocks show this extension.

4. **Colored block edges/adjacencies (any non-Maroon color) ↔ Composite formation in output**  
   - Effect: In outputs, preserved or extended blocks abut to form L/T shapes or stacks, but only where input positions already suggest proximity (e.g., abutting edges lead to shared silhouettes in output). No new distant connections created.  
   - Interaction: Specific color pairs show consistent adjacency effects:  
     - Yellow edges → abut Green or Blue edges (e.g., forms vertical/horizontal extensions or borders).  
     - Green edges → border or top Yellow/Red/Orange (e.g., short Green segments cap adjacent assemblies).  
     - Red/Orange edges → stack with Blue or Green (e.g., vertical alignment).  
   - Consistency: Observed in both train outputs for adjacent input pairs (e.g., Train 1: Yellow [18,0,19,1] abuts Red [18,1,18,6], extended to stack with Green [19,2,19,5]; Train 2: Yellow [14,3,14,3] abuts Red [15,3,20,3], preserved adjacency with Blue above). No inconsistent pairs (e.g., no Yellow-Pink abutment effects). Input scatters do not create output composites without prior edge proximity.

5. **Maroon background (holes > 0 in input) ↔ Colored block positions (all non-Maroon)**  
   - Effect: Input positions of colored blocks (singles or multi) cause localized pixel reduction in Maroon (main component pixels decrease: 695→435 in Train 1; 510→428 in Train 2), with new holes=0 Maroon sub-components created (e.g., horizontal/vertical bars). Holes reduce to 0 in main output Maroon.  
   - Interaction: Colored block positions "carve" or displace Maroon pixels to accommodate preservations/extensions (#1–3), forming new Maroon bars adjacent to transformed areas. No effect on block colors themselves. Specific carving pattern (e.g., why certain rows/columns) is unknown.  
   - Consistency: Universal in both trains; all Maroon changes tie directly to colored block locations (e.g., extensions in #3 overwrite Maroon; preserved blocks occupy same spaces). No Maroon changes without nearby colored blocks.

### Notes on Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Transform details**: Extension lengths/directions (#3) and Maroon carving selections (#5) cannot be explained consistently (e.g., vertical for some singles, horizontal for others; no clear position/color rule visible across both trains).
- **Irrelevant elements**: Standalone Maroon (no ties to blocks) excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., potential hole count effects on movement—not present in both) omitted. Test input not used for consistency check, but noted elements (e.g., Dark Red single, Pink single) align with #3 pattern observationally.
- No forced connections: E.g., no assumed "semantic" interactions like color "influencing movement" beyond position-based preservation/extension; silhouettes/holes in colored blocks (all holes=0) have no observed cross-example effect.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

# Existing count function is helpful for identifying singletons pre- and post-fill
def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

# Helpful for finding singleton positions after stem processing
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> dict:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly identified singletons (e.g., in train1, s1=1,s2=2,s3=3) and their positions, enabling basic pattern triggering.
 * Successfully filled some top/bottom 3-column propagations (e.g., train1 top with 2-3-4? but mismatched colors; bottom with 2-3-1 correctly in parts).
 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs/outputs (and noting consistency requirements), only obvious, direct interactions or effects between elements are listed below. These are limited to patterns that appear in **both** train examples without exception. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone Maroon background without transformation ties) are excluded. No high-level puzzle interpretation or solution is attempted. Where a transformation or effect cannot be explained with visible consistency (e.g., exact mechanics of length/direction), it is noted as unknown. Semantic meanings (e.g., "pillars" or "caps") are not assumed unless tied to a property like position or adjacency.

1. **Multi-pixel colored blocks (pixels > 1, non-Maroon colors: Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Pink, Orange, Light Blue) ↔ Position and shape preservation**  
   - Effect: These blocks (vertical stacks, horizontal segments, or short bars) retain exact position (bbox), pixel count, and holes=0 in the output. No transformation or movement occurs.  
   - Interaction: Their fixed presence constrains adjacent Maroon reconfiguration (see #5), but no direct effect on other colored blocks.  
   - Consistency: Applies to all such blocks in both train inputs (e.g., Train 1: Red [18,1,18,6] pixels=6; Green [19,2,19,5] pixels=4; Train 2: Blue [14,2,22,2] pixels=9; Red [15,3,20,3] pixels=6). No exceptions.

2. **Single-pixel Yellow blocks (pixels=1, holes=0) ↔ No transformation**  
   - Effect: Preserved exactly as single pixels in the same position (bbox) in the output. No extension, movement, or size change.  
   - Interaction: Isolated from other elements; no observed effect on nearby colors or Maroon (e.g., no adjacency-triggered changes).  
   - Consistency: All Yellow singles in both trains follow this (e.g., Train 1: Yellow [19,6,19,6] pixels=1; Train 2: Yellow [14,3,14,3] pixels=1). Differs from non-Yellow singles (see #3).

3. **Single-pixel non-Yellow colored blocks (pixels=1, holes=0; colors: Pink, Blue, Orange, Green, Light Blue) ↔ Extension transformation**  
   - Effect: These are extended into larger rectangular blocks (increased pixels, adjusted bbox) in the output, typically forming lines (horizontal or vertical). Original position influences the extension's starting point.  
   - Interaction: Affects adjacent Maroon by overwriting/replacing pixels in the background to form the extension (Maroon pixel count decreases overall). Direction (horizontal/vertical) and length (e.g., to 2–17 pixels) are unknown and vary. No effect on preserved multi-pixel blocks.  
   - Consistency: Applies to all such singles in both trains (e.g., Train 1: Pink [28,19,28,19] → extended horizontal to pixels=5; Blue [13,25,13,25] → extended vertical to pixels=17; Train 2: Pink [19,0,19,0] → extended vertical to pixels=2; Green [0,1,0,1] → extended horizontal to pixels=5; Light Blue [0,5,0,5] → extended horizontal to pixels=5). Yellow singles excluded (see #2). No multi-pixel blocks show this extension.

4. **Colored block edges/adjacencies (any non-Maroon color) ↔ Composite formation in output**  
   - Effect: In outputs, preserved or extended blocks abut to form L/T shapes or stacks, but only where input positions already suggest proximity (e.g., abutting edges lead to shared silhouettes in output). No new distant connections created.  
   - Interaction: Specific color pairs show consistent adjacency effects:  
     - Yellow edges → abut Green or Blue edges (e.g., forms vertical/horizontal extensions or borders).  
     - Green edges → border or top Yellow/Red/Orange (e.g., short Green segments cap adjacent assemblies).  
     - Red/Orange edges → stack with Blue or Green (e.g., vertical alignment).  
   - Consistency: Observed in both train outputs for adjacent input pairs (e.g., Train 1: Yellow [18,0,19,1] abuts Red [18,1,18,6], extended to stack with Green [19,2,19,5]; Train 2: Yellow [14,3,14,3] abuts Red [15,3,20,3], preserved adjacency with Blue above). No inconsistent pairs (e.g., no Yellow-Pink abutment effects). Input scatters do not create output composites without prior edge proximity.

5. **Maroon background (holes > 0 in input) ↔ Colored block positions (all non-Maroon)**  
   - Effect: Input positions of colored blocks (singles or multi) cause localized pixel reduction in Maroon (main component pixels decrease: 695→435 in Train 1; 510→428 in Train 2), with new holes=0 Maroon sub-components created (e.g., horizontal/vertical bars). Holes reduce to 0 in main output Maroon.  
   - Interaction: Colored block positions "carve" or displace Maroon pixels to accommodate preservations/extensions (#1–3), forming new Maroon bars adjacent to transformed areas. No effect on block colors themselves. Specific carving pattern (e.g., why certain rows/columns) is unknown.  
   - Consistency: Universal in both trains; all Maroon changes tie directly to colored block locations (e.g., extensions in #3 overwrite Maroon; preserved blocks occupy same spaces). No Maroon changes without nearby colored blocks.

### Notes on Unknowns and Exclusions
- **Transform details**: Extension lengths/directions (#3) and Maroon carving selections (#5) cannot be explained consistently (e.g., vertical for some singles, horizontal for others; no clear position/color rule visible across both trains).
- **Irrelevant elements**: Standalone Maroon (no ties to blocks) excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., potential hole count effects on movement—not present in both) omitted. Test input not used for consistency check, but noted elements (e.g., Dark Red single, Pink single) align with #3 pattern observationally.
- No forced connections: E.g., no assumed "semantic" interactions like color "influencing movement" beyond position-based preservation/extension; silhouettes/holes in colored blocks (all holes=0) have no observed cross-example effect.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:25:32] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (similar to a logic or pattern-completion puzzle like Fillomino or a variant of nonogram with color rules) where a partial grid with numbers representing colors (1,2,3,4,6,7,9) and blanks (8) must be completed by propagating fills based on detected patterns from unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (runs of 1 or 2 of length >=4). The goal is to fill blanks horizontally and vertically according to specific offset-based rules triggered by isolated stems and singleton positions at the top, bottom, or middle of the grid, ensuring no overfills or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors appearing once each); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent mapping (e.g., s1=1, s2=3, s3=6 in training example 2).
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) in a column, length >=4; only "isolated" stems (no overlapping adjacent stems of the opposite type in neighboring columns) trigger horizontal fills at specific row offsets: for type 1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for type 2, offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1] (where l=stem length)—fills propagate left/right until non-blank or edge.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singletons): Trigger a 3-column pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c>=4: cols [c-4,c-3,c] with [s3,s2,s1]) and propagate downward while rows are all blank in those columns; partial fill starts at row 0.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singletons): Similar but mirrored (e.g., for s1 at c: [c,c+1,c+4] with [s1,s2,s3]), propagate upward; partial fill at bottom row; anchors adjust for s2/s3 positions to fit left/right constraints.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom): Extend horizontally left/right from the singleton's position until non-blank or edge, but only in that row—no vertical propagation.
 * Order matters: Process stems first (as they may create or block patterns), then top patterns, bottom patterns, then middle extensions; avoid filling over existing non-blanks.
 * Subtleties: Patterns may not fill full height if blocked; stems must be exactly isolated (no vertical overlap with opposite-type adjacent stems); offsets can exceed grid height (skip invalid rows); colors like 4,6,7,9 may be pre-filled and influence isolation/blocking; horizontal fills stop at edges or non-8; singletons can be pre-filled in stems or patterns.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; singletons not in expected positions (e.g., too left for anchors) skip pattern placement; multiple singletons may trigger overlapping fills, but propagation checks for all-blank rows prevent conflicts.
 * Potential misses: Not handling partial vertical propagation correctly (e.g., stopping when a pattern row has a non-8); incorrect offset calculations for stems (e.g., l-2 may be invalid); assuming all singletons trigger patterns when only top/bottom do; not sorting singletons leading to color mismatches; stems of length exactly 4 may have offset l-2=2, which could overlap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely simple top/bottom or stem case).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated incorrect horizontal fills from stems (e.g., row 3 left side unfilled as 8's, but expected 6's across cols 0-4; row 1 has 3's instead of expected 3's only partially? Wait, row 1 matches, but row 3 mismatch suggests wrong offset/color for a type-2 stem or isolation failure).
 * In training 2 generated vs expected: Lower section (rows ~10-17, cols ~16-18) shows repeated vertical 2/1/4 but no horizontal extensions or patterned fills (e.g., expected row 11 cols 18-26=3's, row 12=6's, row 14=9's from a bottom or middle pattern, but generated leaves them 8's—likely because place_bottom_pattern or extend_middle didn't trigger due to singleton positions not at exact bottom or incorrect anchor checks; also row 3 cols 0-4=8's vs expected 6's, indicating stem processing skipped or miscolored an isolated stem).
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected some verticals like col 16 1's and col 17 2's/4's), but isolation check or offset application failed for left-side stems.
 * Top/bottom pattern placement worked for upper parts (e.g., row 0/1 partial matches, row 5 9's match), but propagation stopped prematurely or didn't apply to lower singletons.
 * Middle extensions applied minimally (e.g., no horizontals from lower 1/2/4), suggesting pos_dict didn't capture them as middle or extend_middle only hit non-8 blocks immediately.
 * No overfills observed, but underfills dominate failures; count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions seem correct (identified singletons properly).
 * find_stems is helpful but may miss non-1/2 stems or short runs; is_isolated is essential but potentially too strict (e.g., if adjacent stems don't overlap vertically, it should pass—bug if it falsely rejects).
 * fill_horizontal is useful for propagation but doesn't handle vertical checks.
 * place_top_pattern and place_bottom_pattern are partially correct (anchor logic for s1/s2/s3 positions) but fail on propagation (e.g., checks all-blank but may not partial-fill correctly if singleton not blank).
 * extend_middle is broken/incomplete: Only horizontal from middle singletons, but expected shows vertical-like patterns (e.g., staggered horizontals at offsets), suggesting it needs to treat middle as mini-stems or patterns.
 * process_stems orders offsets/colors correctly for types but skips if offsets out-of-bounds; however, in training 2, it filled row 3 cols 14-22 as 4/2's correctly but missed left 6's—likely a separate stem not isolated.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct overall; it shows partial pattern fills (e.g., row 1: 9's in cols 4-7? Wait, row 0 has 1's at cols 4-5; row 1 9's cols 0-3 and 4=4? Inconsistent with singleton rules—singletons seem to be 1,3,4? But fills like row 2 9's cols 6-15 and 3's/2's/1's suggest top-pattern propagation from a row0 singleton, but colors mismatch expected s1/s2/s3 mapping).
 * Upper section: Row 4 full 6's cols 6-28 looks like a horizontal from stem offset, but row 5 full 7's suggests another, yet no vertical stems visible in input (test input not provided, but output implies over-propagation or wrong colors—7's may be pre-filled, but filling over?).
 * Lower section: Row 11 full 9's cols 0-23 then 2/4/7's staggered; row 12 6's cols 0-23 then 2/4; row 13 7's cols 0-23 then 2/4— this looks like bottom-pattern propagation upward, but staggered ends (e.g., 7's in row 12 col 28?) and row 24-28 mirroring upper suggest symmetric but incorrect color assignments (e.g., why 9's then 6's then 7's? Likely wrong s1/s2/s3 or offset misapplication; expected might stagger based on multiple singletons, but output fills too uniformly leftward).
 * Middle empties (rows 7-10, 16-23 all 8's) indicate missed middle extensions or no detected middle singletons (e.g., row 6 has 3's cols 4-5, but no horizontal spread).
 * No obvious overfills, but underfills in potential stem areas (e.g., col 4 has vertical 4/2/6/7/3/8..., suggesting a stem of mixed types not processed); output doesn't match puzzle logic as fills seem to ignore isolation (e.g., adjacent columns filled similarly without check).
 * Test has wider grid (29 cols?) with more pre-fills (e.g., row 2 has 9's and 3/2/1 clusters), implying complex interactions—output partially captures vertical propagation (e.g., row 4-5 horizontals) but fails on horizontal offsets from lower singletons (e.g., row 24 has 1's/4/2/9's but no full lines).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for simple top/bottom but not for intertwined stems/singletons—likely inherits training 2 bugs (e.g., no patterned horizontals in lower right).

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **both** train examples (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties or elements that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every case, without speculation on overall puzzle mechanics or unexplainable transformations. Only elements with clear, repeated patterns (e.g., preservation, extension, or modification) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated shapes with no change or addition, varying stripe widths/heights without clear triggers, or semantic meanings like "frames" without property-level ties) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., exact determination of fill color sequences or why some areas get filled vs. others) are explicitly noted.

#### 1. **Non-Maroon Shapes ↔ Background (Maroon) Position and Extension**
   - **Description**: Isolated single-pixel or small non-Maroon shapes (pixels ≤5, often bbox width/height=1) at canvas edges interact with adjacent Maroon background areas to trigger extensions of the shape's own color into longer bars. The direction of extension is determined by the shape's position relative to the canvas edge.
     - Left edge position (bbox min_x = 0) → Horizontal rightward extension of the same color into Maroon, increasing bbox width to 5 (pixels=5 for height=1 row), same row.
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 (none directly, but pattern holds by absence); Train 2 Green (row 1, col 0 → col 0-4 row 1, pixels 1→5); Light Blue (row 5, col 0 → col 0-4 row 5, pixels 1→5).
     - Right edge position (bbox max_x near canvas width, e.g., 28) → Horizontal leftward extension of the same color into Maroon, increasing bbox width to 5 (pixels=5 for height=1 row), same row.
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 Pink (row 19, col 28 → col 24-28 row 19, pixels 1→5); Train 2 (none directly, but pattern holds by absence).
     - Bottom edge position (bbox max_y = canvas height, e.g., 25) → Vertical upward extension of the same color into Maroon, increasing bbox height (pixels increase proportionally), same column, starting from the shape's row upward to just below the nearest upper cluster.
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 Orange (row 25, col 3 → rows 9-25 col 3, pixels 1→17, height=17); Blue (row 25, col 13 → rows 17-25 col 13, pixels 1→9, height=9). Train 2 (none directly at absolute bottom, but pattern holds by absence—no bottom-edge singles).
   - **Affected Properties**: Input bbox is contained within output bbox (position preservation with expansion); color unchanged; pixels increase (≥ input value); interacts with Maroon by overwriting pixels (Maroon pixels decrease overall).
   - **Consistency Note**: Occurs only for isolated edge shapes (not clusters or internal); non-edge small shapes often remain unchanged (see below). Unknown: Why height varies (e.g., 9 vs. 17)—appears tied to distance to upper clusters, but not fully explainable from data.

#### 2. **Small Shape Clusters ↔ Adjacent Maroon Areas (Fill Creation)**
   - **Description**: Existing small shape clusters (groups of 2+ connected non-Maroon shapes, e.g., vertical stacks or horizontal bars with shared bbox edges/rows/columns) interact with adjacent empty Maroon areas to create new bars in those areas. Direction of new bars depends on adjacency:
     - Below a horizontal cluster → Vertical bars created upward from bottom edge into Maroon, starting 1 row below cluster max_y, extending to canvas bottom (row 25), in columns near the cluster (e.g., overlapping or adjacent cols).
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 (below row 7-8 cluster col 1-7 → vertical bars rows 9-25 col 2-6); (below row 15-16 cluster col 12-18 → vertical bars rows 17-25 col 13-17). Train 2 (none directly below horizontal, but pattern holds by absence—lower cluster is vertical, triggers side fill instead).
     - To the right of a vertical cluster → Horizontal bars created left-to-right into Maroon, starting at cluster's min_y or adjacent row, in rows overlapping cluster height, extending to canvas right edge (col 26).
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 (none directly right of vertical); Train 2 (right of row 9-17 cluster col 16-17 → horizontal bars rows 10-14 col 18-26, width=9).
     - To the left of a vertical/top cluster → Horizontal bars created rightward into Maroon, from row 0 down to cluster min_y or fixed height (e.g., 6 rows), width to cluster min_x -1.
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 (left of row 0-6 cluster col 18-19 → horizontal bars rows 0-5 col 0-17, width=18); Train 2 (left of scattered top clusters → horizontal bars rows 0-5 col 0-4, width=5).
   - **Affected Properties**: New shapes created with colors from palette (often secondary: Pink, Maroon; sometimes primary like Green or Blue); no direct bbox overlap with input shapes; increases overall connectivity (new bars touch or align with cluster edges); Maroon pixels decrease as areas are overwritten.
   - **Consistency Note**: Fills always adjacent to clusters (no isolated fills); height/width varies by available Maroon space (e.g., to edge or cluster boundary). Unknown: Exact color sequence for new bars (e.g., Train 1 uses Blue-Orange-Maroon-Maroon-Pink aligned to seed color; Train 2 uses Light Blue-Maroon-Pink-Maroon-Green aligned similarly, but sequences differ—cannot explain variation from data).

#### 3. **All Non-Maroon Shapes ↔ Preservation in Output**
   - **Description**: All input non-Maroon shapes (regardless of size or position) have direct counterparts in output, maintaining core properties while interacting with background for potential expansion (as above).
     - Color unchanged.
     - Position preserved (output bbox contains or equals input bbox).
     - Shape properties (holes=0 always; pixels ≥ input value; bbox dimensions non-decreasing).
     - No deletion or relocation—only extension or unchanged.
   - **Consistent Examples**: Train 1 (e.g., all listed Yellow/Red/Green/Blue/Pink/Orange preserved or extended as noted); Train 2 (e.g., all Pink/Yellow/Green/Blue/Red/Light Blue preserved or extended as noted).
   - **Affected Properties**: Interacts with Maroon by potentially expanding into it (pixels of non-Maroon increase total); no effect on holes (remain 0).
   - **Consistency Note**: Applies to every non-Maroon shape in both trains; unchanged for internal/cluster shapes (e.g., vertical stacks like Red col 18 rows 1-6 in Train 1; Blue col 5 rows 0-8 in Train 2).

#### 4. **Maroon Background ↔ Overall Transformation (Global Effect)**
   - **Description**: The large input Maroon shape (bbox covering near-full canvas, holes >0) interacts with all non-Maroon shapes and new fills by having its pixels overwritten or subdivided, resulting in multiple smaller Maroon pieces in output.
     - Input holes (2-3) → Output big Maroon has holes=0 (all smaller Maroons also holes=0).
     - Pixels decrease consistently (Train 1: 695 → 435, delta -260; Train 2: 510 → 428, delta -82), due to extensions/fills overwriting Maroon areas.
     - Bbox of big Maroon unchanged, but subdivided into bars (e.g., horizontal/vertical Maroon segments in fills).
   - **Affected Properties**: Holes reduced to 0 (effect from fills closing gaps?); pixels reduced proportional to new non-Maroon additions; position unchanged but fragmented.
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in both trains (and test input has holes=2, suggesting same); directly affected by all above interactions (extensions/fills target Maroon). Unknown: Exact pixel delta calculation (varies, likely tied to fill sizes).

No other connections (e.g., color → color changes, hole count → specific shape properties, or inconsistent fills like top-only bars) are obvious and present in **every** example. Elements like ramps (▄) or silhouettes are not evident in the data (all appear solid, holes=0 except input Maroon). No high-level solution inferred—these are purely property-level interactions from direct input/output diffs.

[2025-09-30 23:27:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (similar to a logic or pattern-completion puzzle like Fillomino or a variant of nonogram with color rules) where a partial grid with numbers representing colors (1,2,3,4,6,7,9) and blanks (8) must be completed by propagating fills based on detected patterns from unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (runs of 1 or 2 of length >=4). The goal is to fill blanks horizontally and vertically according to specific offset-based rules triggered by isolated stems and singleton positions at the top, bottom, or middle of the grid, ensuring no overfills or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors appearing once each); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent mapping (e.g., s1=1, s2=3, s3=6 in training example 2).
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) in a column, length >=4; only "isolated" stems (no overlapping adjacent stems of the opposite type in neighboring columns) trigger horizontal fills at specific row offsets: for type 1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for type 2, offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1] (where l=stem length)—fills propagate left/right until non-blank or edge.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singletons): Trigger a 3-column pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c>=4: cols [c-4,c-3,c] with [s3,s2,s1]) and propagate downward while rows are all blank in those columns; partial fill starts at row 0.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singletons): Similar but mirrored (e.g., for s1 at c: [c,c+1,c+4] with [s1,s2,s3]), propagate upward; partial fill at bottom row; anchors adjust for s2/s3 positions to fit left/right constraints.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom): Extend horizontally left/right from the singleton's position until non-blank or edge, but only in that row—no vertical propagation.
 * Order matters: Process stems first (as they may create or block patterns), then top patterns, bottom patterns, then middle extensions; avoid filling over existing non-blanks.
 * Subtleties: Patterns may not fill full height if blocked; stems must be exactly isolated (no vertical overlap with opposite-type adjacent stems); offsets can exceed grid height (skip invalid rows); colors like 4,6,7,9 may be pre-filled and influence isolation/blocking; horizontal fills stop at edges or non-8; singletons can be pre-filled in stems or patterns.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; singletons not in expected positions (e.g., too left for anchors) skip pattern placement; multiple singletons may trigger overlapping fills, but propagation checks for all-blank rows prevent conflicts.
 * Potential misses: Not handling partial vertical propagation correctly (e.g., stopping when a pattern row has a non-8); incorrect offset calculations for stems (e.g., l-2 may be invalid); assuming all singletons trigger patterns when only top/bottom do; not sorting singletons leading to color mismatches; stems of length exactly 4 may have offset l-2=2, which could overlap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely simple top/bottom or stem case).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated incorrect horizontal fills from stems (e.g., row 3 left side unfilled as 8's, but expected 6's across cols 0-4; row 1 has 3's instead of expected 3's only partially? Wait, row 1 matches, but row 3 mismatch suggests wrong offset/color for a type-2 stem or isolation failure).
 * In training 2 generated vs expected: Lower section (rows ~10-17, cols ~16-18) shows repeated vertical 2/1/4 but no horizontal extensions or patterned fills (e.g., expected row 11 cols 18-26=3's, row 12=6's, row 14=9's from a bottom or middle pattern, but generated leaves them 8's—likely because place_bottom_pattern or extend_middle didn't trigger due to singleton positions not at exact bottom or incorrect anchor checks; also row 3 cols 0-4=8's vs expected 6's, indicating stem processing skipped or miscolored an isolated stem).
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected some verticals like col 16 1's and col 17 2's/4's), but isolation check or offset application failed for left-side stems.
 * Top/bottom pattern placement worked for upper parts (e.g., row 0/1 partial matches, row 5 9's match), but propagation stopped prematurely or didn't apply to lower singletons.
 * Middle extensions applied minimally (e.g., no horizontals from lower 1/2/4), suggesting pos_dict didn't capture them as middle or extend_middle only hit non-8 blocks immediately.
 * No overfills observed, but underfills dominate failures; count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions seem correct (identified singletons properly).
 * find_stems is helpful but may miss non-1/2 stems or short runs; is_isolated is essential but potentially too strict (e.g., if adjacent stems don't overlap vertically, it should pass—bug if it falsely rejects).
 * fill_horizontal is useful for propagation but doesn't handle vertical checks.
 * place_top_pattern and place_bottom_pattern are partially correct (anchor logic for s1/s2/s3 positions) but fail on propagation (e.g., checks all-blank but may not partial-fill correctly if singleton not blank).
 * extend_middle is broken/incomplete: Only horizontal from middle singletons, but expected shows vertical-like patterns (e.g., staggered horizontals at offsets), suggesting it needs to treat middle as mini-stems or patterns.
 * process_stems orders offsets/colors correctly for types but skips if offsets out-of-bounds; however, in training 2, it filled row 3 cols 14-22 as 4/2's correctly but missed left 6's—likely a separate stem not isolated.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct overall; it shows partial pattern fills (e.g., row 1: 9's in cols 4-7? Wait, row 0 has 1's at cols 4-5; row 1 9's cols 0-3 and 4=4? Inconsistent with singleton rules—singletons seem to be 1,3,4? But fills like row 2 9's cols 6-15 and 3's/2's/1's suggest top-pattern propagation from a row0 singleton, but colors mismatch expected s1/s2/s3 mapping).
 * Upper section: Row 4 full 6's cols 6-28 looks like a horizontal from stem offset, but row 5 full 7's suggests another, yet no vertical stems visible in input (test input not provided, but output implies over-propagation or wrong colors—7's may be pre-filled, but filling over?).
 * Lower section: Row 11 full 9's cols 0-23 then 2/4/7's staggered; row 12 6's cols 0-23 then 2/4; row 13 7's cols 0-23 then 2/4— this looks like bottom-pattern propagation upward, but staggered ends (e.g., 7's in row 12 col 28?) and row 24-28 mirroring upper suggest symmetric but incorrect color assignments (e.g., why 9's then 6's then 7's? Likely wrong s1/s2/s3 or offset misapplication; expected might stagger based on multiple singletons, but output fills too uniformly leftward).
 * Middle empties (rows 7-10, 16-23 all 8's) indicate missed middle extensions or no detected middle singletons (e.g., row 6 has 3's cols 4-5, but no horizontal spread).
 * No obvious overfills, but underfills in potential stem areas (e.g., col 4 has vertical 4/2/6/7/3/8..., suggesting a stem of mixed types not processed); output doesn't match puzzle logic as fills seem to ignore isolation (e.g., adjacent columns filled similarly without check).
 * Test has wider grid (29 cols?) with more pre-fills (e.g., row 2 has 9's and 3/2/1 clusters), implying complex interactions—output partially captures vertical propagation (e.g., row 4-5 horizontals) but fails on horizontal offsets from lower singletons (e.g., row 24 has 1's/4/2/9's but no full lines).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for simple top/bottom but not for intertwined stems/singletons—likely inherits training 2 bugs (e.g., no patterned horizontals in lower right).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    # Counts occurrences of each non-8 color; useful for identifying exactly 3 singletons.
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):

            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts
```

```python
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]]:
    # Maps each singleton color to its (row, col) position; essential for triggering position-based rules.
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    pos_dict: Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]] = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

```python
def find_stems(g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    # Finds vertical runs of 1s or 2s of length >=4; returns (start_row, end_row, col, type); key for horizontal fills after singletons.
    runs = []
    for col in range(w):
        i = 0
        while i < h:
            val = g[i][col]
            if val == 1 or val == 2:
                cl = val
                start_i = i
                i += 1
                while i < h and g[i][col] == cl:
                    i += 1
                length = i - start_i
                if length >= 4:
                    runs.append((start_i, i - 1, col, cl))
            else:
                i += 1
    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly identified singletons (e.g., in train1, s1=1,s2=2,s3=3) and their positions, enabling basic pattern triggering.
 * Successfully filled some top/bottom 3-column propagations (e.g., train1 top with 2-3-4? but mismatched colors; bottom with 2-3-1 correctly in parts).
 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison of the provided train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **both** train examples (Train 1 and Train 2). These are limited to properties or elements that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every case, without speculation on overall puzzle mechanics or unexplainable transformations. Only elements with clear, repeated patterns (e.g., preservation, extension, or modification) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated shapes with no change or addition, varying stripe widths/heights without clear triggers, or semantic meanings like "frames" without property-level ties) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., exact determination of fill color sequences or why some areas get filled vs. others) are explicitly noted.

#### 1. **Non-Maroon Shapes ↔ Background (Maroon) Position and Extension**
   - **Description**: Isolated single-pixel or small non-Maroon shapes (pixels ≤5, often bbox width/height=1) at canvas edges interact with adjacent Maroon background areas to trigger extensions of the shape's own color into longer bars. The direction of extension is determined by the shape's position relative to the canvas edge.
     - Left edge position (bbox min_x = 0) → Horizontal rightward extension of the same color into Maroon, increasing bbox width to 5 (pixels=5 for height=1 row), same row.
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 (none directly, but pattern holds by absence); Train 2 Green (row 1, col 0 → col 0-4 row 1, pixels 1→5); Light Blue (row 5, col 0 → col 0-4 row 5, pixels 1→5).
     - Right edge position (bbox max_x near canvas width, e.g., 28) → Horizontal leftward extension of the same color into Maroon, increasing bbox width to 5 (pixels=5 for height=1 row), same row.
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 Pink (row 19, col 28 → col 24-28 row 19, pixels 1→5); Train 2 (none directly, but pattern holds by absence).
     - Bottom edge position (bbox max_y = canvas height, e.g., 25) → Vertical upward extension of the same color into Maroon, increasing bbox height (pixels increase proportionally), same column, starting from the shape's row upward to just below the nearest upper cluster.
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 Orange (row 25, col 3 → rows 9-25 col 3, pixels 1→17, height=17); Blue (row 25, col 13 → rows 17-25 col 13, pixels 1→9, height=9). Train 2 (none directly at absolute bottom, but pattern holds by absence—no bottom-edge singles).
   - **Affected Properties**: Input bbox is contained within output bbox (position preservation with expansion); color unchanged; pixels increase (≥ input value); interacts with Maroon by overwriting pixels (Maroon pixels decrease overall).
   - **Consistency Note**: Occurs only for isolated edge shapes (not clusters or internal); non-edge small shapes often remain unchanged (see below). Unknown: Why height varies (e.g., 9 vs. 17)—appears tied to distance to upper clusters, but not fully explainable from data.

#### 2. **Small Shape Clusters ↔ Adjacent Maroon Areas (Fill Creation)**
   - **Description**: Existing small shape clusters (groups of 2+ connected non-Maroon shapes, e.g., vertical stacks or horizontal bars with shared bbox edges/rows/columns) interact with adjacent empty Maroon areas to create new bars in those areas. Direction of new bars depends on adjacency:
     - Below a horizontal cluster → Vertical bars created upward from bottom edge into Maroon, starting 1 row below cluster max_y, extending to canvas bottom (row 25), in columns near the cluster (e.g., overlapping or adjacent cols).
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 (below row 7-8 cluster col 1-7 → vertical bars rows 9-25 col 2-6); (below row 15-16 cluster col 12-18 → vertical bars rows 17-25 col 13-17). Train 2 (none directly below horizontal, but pattern holds by absence—lower cluster is vertical, triggers side fill instead).
     - To the right of a vertical cluster → Horizontal bars created left-to-right into Maroon, starting at cluster's min_y or adjacent row, in rows overlapping cluster height, extending to canvas right edge (col 26).
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 (none directly right of vertical); Train 2 (right of row 9-17 cluster col 16-17 → horizontal bars rows 10-14 col 18-26, width=9).
     - To the left of a vertical/top cluster → Horizontal bars created rightward into Maroon, from row 0 down to cluster min_y or fixed height (e.g., 6 rows), width to cluster min_x -1.
       - Consistent examples: Train 1 (left of row 0-6 cluster col 18-19 → horizontal bars rows 0-5 col 0-17, width=18); Train 2 (left of scattered top clusters → horizontal bars rows 0-5 col 0-4, width=5).
   - **Affected Properties**: New shapes created with colors from palette (often secondary: Pink, Maroon; sometimes primary like Green or Blue); no direct bbox overlap with input shapes; increases overall connectivity (new bars touch or align with cluster edges); Maroon pixels decrease as areas are overwritten.
   - **Consistency Note**: Fills always adjacent to clusters (no isolated fills); height/width varies by available Maroon space (e.g., to edge or cluster boundary). Unknown: Exact color sequence for new bars (e.g., Train 1 uses Blue-Orange-Maroon-Maroon-Pink aligned to seed color; Train 2 uses Light Blue-Maroon-Pink-Maroon-Green aligned similarly, but sequences differ—cannot explain variation from data).

#### 3. **All Non-Maroon Shapes ↔ Preservation in Output**
   - **Description**: All input non-Maroon shapes (regardless of size or position) have direct counterparts in output, maintaining core properties while interacting with background for potential expansion (as above).
     - Color unchanged.
     - Position preserved (output bbox contains or equals input bbox).
     - Shape properties (holes=0 always; pixels ≥ input value; bbox dimensions non-decreasing).
     - No deletion or relocation—only extension or unchanged.
   - **Consistent Examples**: Train 1 (e.g., all listed Yellow/Red/Green/Blue/Pink/Orange preserved or extended as noted); Train 2 (e.g., all Pink/Yellow/Green/Blue/Red/Light Blue preserved or extended as noted).
   - **Affected Properties**: Interacts with Maroon by potentially expanding into it (pixels of non-Maroon increase total); no effect on holes (remain 0).
   - **Consistency Note**: Applies to every non-Maroon shape in both trains; unchanged for internal/cluster shapes (e.g., vertical stacks like Red col 18 rows 1-6 in Train 1; Blue col 5 rows 0-8 in Train 2).

#### 4. **Maroon Background ↔ Overall Transformation (Global Effect)**
   - **Description**: The large input Maroon shape (bbox covering near-full canvas, holes >0) interacts with all non-Maroon shapes and new fills by having its pixels overwritten or subdivided, resulting in multiple smaller Maroon pieces in output.
     - Input holes (2-3) → Output big Maroon has holes=0 (all smaller Maroons also holes=0).
     - Pixels decrease consistently (Train 1: 695 → 435, delta -260; Train 2: 510 → 428, delta -82), due to extensions/fills overwriting Maroon areas.
     - Bbox of big Maroon unchanged, but subdivided into bars (e.g., horizontal/vertical Maroon segments in fills).
   - **Affected Properties**: Holes reduced to 0 (effect from fills closing gaps?); pixels reduced proportional to new non-Maroon additions; position unchanged but fragmented.
   - **Consistency Note**: Present in both trains (and test input has holes=2, suggesting same); directly affected by all above interactions (extensions/fills target Maroon). Unknown: Exact pixel delta calculation (varies, likely tied to fill sizes).

No other connections (e.g., color → color changes, hole count → specific shape properties, or inconsistent fills like top-only bars) are obvious and present in **every** example. Elements like ramps (▄) or silhouettes are not evident in the data (all appear solid, holes=0 except input Maroon). No high-level solution inferred—these are purely property-level interactions from direct input/output diffs.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:34:21] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle similar to a nonogram or pattern-propagation challenge, where a partially filled grid (with numbers 1-9 as colors and 8 as blanks) must be completed by identifying three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each), detecting vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2), and applying specific filling rules like horizontal extensions, vertical propagations from top/bottom singletons, and isolated stem patterns to propagate colors logically without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors with count==1); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) of length >=4 in a column; type 1 stems (value=1) and type 2 (value=2) have opposite behaviors, with isolation checked against adjacent columns (c-1 or c+1) for opposite-type stems of equal or longer length that overlap vertically.
 * For isolated stems, fill horizontals at specific row offsets: type 1 uses offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; type 2 uses [0,3,length-2] with [s3,s2,s1]; extend left/right from the stem column until non-blank or edge.
 * Subtlety for type 1 stems: Check for a left-prefix (adjacent left column with >=2 consistent non-stem/non-blank cells); if present, fill an extra row (offset=2) rightward with s1 and set the left cell to the prefix color if it's blank/stem.
 * Top-row singletons (r==0) trigger diagonal-ish patterns: depending on which singleton (s1/s2/s3), select column offsets like [-4,-2,0] for s1, and propagate downward only if all pattern columns are blank or match the color in each row.
 * Bottom-row singletons (r==h-1) use asymmetric patterns: e.g., for s1 [0,1,4], propagate upward similarly, but offsets are irregular (e.g., negative for s3).
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right with their color until non-blank.
 * Propagation stops if a row can't be fully matched (any pattern column out-of-bounds or non-matching non-blank).
 * Subtle: Stem processing happens before singleton patterns, so it can pre-fill areas that affect later propagations; avoid overfilling by checking for 8 only.
 * Grids can be tall/narrow (e.g., 21x27 or 29 cols in test); ensure bounds checks (0 <= j < w).
 * No diagonal or complex interactions beyond stems/singletons; unfilled areas remain 8.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for top/bottom are color-ordered differently (top: [s3,s2,s1], bottom: [s1,s2,s3]); isolation requires no vertical overlap with qualifying opposite stems.

```
(Note: Similar propagate_bottom_pattern exists but propagates upward; process_stem_fills handles isolated stem horizontal fills with offsets and left-prefix logic; extend_middle_horizontal does simple left/right extension. These are all helpful for core logic but may need tweaks for overfilling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly handled Training example 1 by properly identifying singletons (e.g., assuming 3,6,9), stems, and propagations to fill the full expected grid without errors.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output overfilled horizontals in the bottom section—e.g., row 10 (0-indexed) has 4,1 followed by nine 3's extending right to col26, but expected has only 4,1 and blanks after (no 3's); row 11 has 4,1,3's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks; row 12 has 2,1, six 6's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks before six 6's? Wait, parsing shows generated extended 3's and misplaced 2's/4's in rows 10-18, likely due to incorrect stem isolation or offset filling in process_stem_fills allowing overlaps or wrong colors (e.g., s1=3? assuming singletons 1,3,6 or similar, but code sorted s1<s2<s3 and applied [s1,s2,s3] wrongly).
 * Stem processing pre-fills interfered with singleton patterns, causing extra fills in non-isolated areas (e.g., generated row 2 has extra 1's and 4's not in expected? No, row 2 matches, but bottom mismatches suggest non-isolated stems were processed anyway).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially (e.g., top fills like row0-1 3's and row3 6's match), but middle/bottom horizontals overextended (e.g., generated row14 has nine 9's, expected matches, but adjacent rows don't).
 * Function is_isolated seems correct but may miss subtle overlaps; process_stem_fills' left-prefix logic might trigger falsely, filling extras (unknown why in this case).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but propagate functions could be stricter on "can_fill" to prevent partial matches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It identifies singletons (likely 1,3,9 or similar, given fills) and applies some stem fills (e.g., row4-5 wide 6's and 7's from a type2 stem?), top/bottom patterns (e.g., row1-2 9's and 3's propagating down, row25-28 9's/6's/7's from bottom), and horizontals (e.g., row11 wide 9's), but overfills inconsistently—e.g., row2 has 9's then 3's/2's/1's clumped awkwardly without clear pattern match, row16 has 1,4 but no further propagation upward despite bottom rules; row7-10 are mostly blank but should propagate from nearby stems/singletons (e.g., col4 has 3's in row6 but no extension); row23-24 have isolated 1's/4's/2's without horizontal extension, suggesting missed middle singleton rule or bounds issues in wider 29-col grid; overall, it fills ~60% logically but leaves gaps (e.g., row6 3's not extended) and adds extras (e.g., row12 wide 9's may overstep isolation), so rules like stem offsets or pattern cols need adjustment for asymmetric grids.

[2025-09-30 23:34:49] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of Train Input 1 vs. Output 1 and Train Input 2 vs. Output 2, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **both** examples. Only properties/components with direct, observable effects or transformations in **every** case are included. No high-level interpretations or puzzle solutions are provided. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact lengths or ordering rules) are noted as such. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated internal multi-pixel shapes like certain Yellow/Red/Green blocks that show no transformation; background uniformity; asymmetric spatial layout without specific effects) are excluded.

#### 1. **Border Position → Transformation of Single-Pixel Components**
   - **Components Involved**: Single-pixel (pixels=1, holes=0) non-Maroon blocks (e.g., Pink, Green, Light Blue, Orange, Blue).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: If a single-pixel block is positioned on a canvas border (x=0 for left, x=bbox_max_x for right, y=0 for top, y=bbox_max_y for bottom), its position triggers a transformation: extension inward by adding same-color pixels adjacent to it.
     - Left border (x=0): Extends right (horizontal, adjusts bbox to increase x-range).
     - Right border (x=max): Extends left (horizontal, adjusts bbox to decrease x-max).
     - Top border (y=0): Extends down (vertical, adjusts bbox to increase y-range).
     - Bottom border (y=max): Extends up (vertical, adjusts bbox to decrease y-max).
   - **Preserved Properties**: Color unchanged; holes remain 0.
   - **Changed Properties**: Bbox expands in the inward direction; pixels increase (from 1 to higher value).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs for **all** border single-pixel blocks in both trains (e.g., Train 1: Pink at x=28 extends left; Orange/Blue at y=25 extend up; Train 2: Green/Light Blue at x=0 extend right; Pink at y=0 extends down). No exceptions.
   - **Unknown**: Exact number of added pixels/length of extension (varies: e.g., +1 in one case, +4 in another, +8/+16 in others; no consistent rule identifiable from data).

#### 2. **Non-Border Position → Preservation of Components**
   - **Components Involved**: All non-Maroon blocks not on border (includes single-pixel internal blocks and all multi-pixel blocks, e.g., Yellow/Red/Green/Blue with pixels>1; internal singles like certain Yellow pixels=1).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Position (internal, not on any border) causes no transformation—components remain unchanged.
   - **Preserved Properties**: Color, bbox (exact coordinates), pixels (exact count), holes (remain 0).
   - **Consistency**: Applies to **all** such components in both trains (e.g., Train 1: All internal Yellow/Red/Green blocks preserved exactly; Train 2: All internal Yellow/Red/Blue blocks preserved exactly). No changes or extensions for these.

#### 3. **Border Single-Pixel Colors → New Component Creation (Color Propagation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Colors from border single-pixel blocks (e.g., Pink, Orange, Blue in Train 1; Green, Pink, Light Blue in Train 2) + Maroon.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Colors of border single-pixel blocks (from interaction #1) propagate to create entirely **new** blocks (not extensions of existing ones) in fill regions (often horizontal/vertical bars near borders or clusters). Maroon is consistently added as adjacent/intermediate blocks.
     - New blocks match the color of a border single-pixel block.
     - Maroon blocks are added next to or between these new colored blocks (e.g., as separators or fillers).
   - **Preserved Properties**: New blocks have holes=0; pixel counts vary but form solid bars (no holes/silhouettes).
   - **Changed/Added Properties**: Introduces new bboxes in previously empty/Maroon areas; pixels added (e.g., horizontal bars of 5–18 pixels).
   - **Consistency**: In both trains, **all** border single-pixel colors appear in new blocks (e.g., Train 1: New Pink/Orange/Blue bars created using border singles' colors, with Maroon adjacent; Train 2: New Green/Pink/Light Blue bars created using border singles' colors, with Maroon adjacent). No new blocks use colors absent from border singles (e.g., no new Green in Train 1, as no border Green single). Maroon always involved in fills.
   - **Unknown**: Exact positions of new blocks relative to originals (near borders/clusters, but placement varies); order/sequence of colors in fills (uses border colors + Maroon, but arrangement not identical); exact pixel counts for new blocks.

#### 4. **Maroon Holes Property → Reduction via Added Components**
   - **Components Involved**: Large Maroon block (encompassing bbox, high pixels, holes>0) + new small components from interactions #1 and #3.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Presence of holes>0 in large Maroon interacts with added new components (extensions and fills from border colors + Maroon small blocks), causing the holes property to transform.
   - **Preserved Properties**: Maroon color unchanged; overall bbox unchanged.
   - **Changed Properties**: Holes reduced to exactly 0; pixels decreased (space overwritten by new small components).
   - **Consistency**: In both trains, large Maroon starts with holes>0 (3 in Train 1, 2 in Train 2) and ends with holes=0; pixels decrease (695→435 in Train 1, 510→428 in Train 2) due to new components filling space. No cases where holes remain >0.
   - **Unknown**: Exact mechanism of hole reduction (e.g., how added components "close" holes topologically; consistent effect but not explainable from bbox/pixels alone).

#### 5. **Cluster Position → Location of New Fills**
   - **Components Involved**: Positions of small non-Maroon clusters (groups of adjacent/nearby blocks) + new fill components from #3.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Positions of existing clusters (e.g., upper-left, lower-right) affect where new fill blocks (from border colors + Maroon) are placed—fills appear adjacent to or bridging cluster positions (e.g., left-side clusters get left-side fills; top/right clusters get top/right fills).
   - **Preserved Properties**: None directly (affects placement only).
   - **Changed Properties**: New bboxes for fills are positioned near clusters (e.g., horizontal fills near top clusters, vertical near bottom/side).
   - **Consistency**: In both trains, new fills are placed relative to cluster locations (e.g., Train 1: Left/lower clusters → left vertical and top horizontal fills; Train 2: Left/top clusters → left horizontal and top-right vertical fills; right/lower clusters → right horizontal fills). No fills in irrelevant areas.
   - **Unknown**: Precise distance or bridging rule (fills are "near" but exact offsets vary; no consistent metric like Euclidean distance identifiable).

No other interactions (e.g., hole count → color changes; specific shape silhouettes/edges → movement; color → position shifts) are consistent across both examples—many vary or are absent in one train. No forced connections (e.g., no evidence of Yellow/Red/Green interacting beyond preservation).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 23:36:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

# Existing count function is helpful for identifying singletons pre- and post-fill

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (similar to a logic or pattern-completion puzzle like Fillomino or a variant of nonogram with color rules) where a partial grid with numbers representing colors (1,2,3,4,6,7,9) and blanks (8) must be completed by propagating fills based on detected patterns from unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (runs of 1 or 2 of length >=4). The goal is to fill blanks horizontally and vertically according to specific offset-based rules triggered by isolated stems and singleton positions at the top, bottom, or middle of the grid, ensuring no overfills or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors appearing once each); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent mapping (e.g., s1=1, s2=3, s3=6 in training example 2).
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) in a column, length >=4; only "isolated" stems (no overlapping adjacent stems of the opposite type in neighboring columns) trigger horizontal fills at specific row offsets: for type 1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for type 2, offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1] (where l=stem length)—fills propagate left/right until non-blank or edge.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singletons): Trigger a 3-column pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c>=4: cols [c-4,c-3,c] with [s3,s2,s1]) and propagate downward while rows are all blank in those columns; partial fill starts at row 0.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singletons): Similar but mirrored (e.g., for s1 at c: [c,c+1,c+4] with [s1,s2,s3]), propagate upward; partial fill at bottom row; anchors adjust for s2/s3 positions to fit left/right constraints.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom): Extend horizontally left/right from the singleton's position until non-blank or edge, but only in that row—no vertical propagation.
 * Order matters: Process stems first (as they may create or block patterns), then top patterns, bottom patterns, then middle extensions; avoid filling over existing non-blanks.
 * Subtleties: Patterns may not fill full height if blocked; stems must be exactly isolated (no vertical overlap with opposite-type adjacent stems); offsets can exceed grid height (skip invalid rows); colors like 4,6,7,9 may be pre-filled and influence isolation/blocking; horizontal fills stop at edges or non-8; singletons can be pre-filled in stems or patterns.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; singletons not in expected positions (e.g., too left for anchors) skip pattern placement; multiple singletons may trigger overlapping fills, but propagation checks for all-blank rows prevent conflicts.
 * Potential misses: Not handling partial vertical propagation correctly (e.g., stopping when a pattern row has a non-8); incorrect offset calculations for stems (e.g., l-2 may be invalid); assuming all singletons trigger patterns when only top/bottom do; not sorting singletons leading to color mismatches; stems of length exactly 4 may have offset l-2=2, which could overlap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely simple top/bottom or stem case).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated incorrect horizontal fills from stems (e.g., row 3 left side unfilled as 8's, but expected 6's across cols 0-4; row 1 has 3's instead of expected 3's only partially? Wait, row 1 matches, but row 3 mismatch suggests wrong offset/color for a type-2 stem or isolation failure).
 * In training 2 generated vs expected: Lower section (rows ~10-17, cols ~16-18) shows repeated vertical 2/1/4 but no horizontal extensions or patterned fills (e.g., expected row 11 cols 18-26=3's, row 12=6's, row 14=9's from a bottom or middle pattern, but generated leaves them 8's—likely because place_bottom_pattern or extend_middle didn't trigger due to singleton positions not at exact bottom or incorrect anchor checks; also row 3 cols 0-4=8's vs expected 6's, indicating stem processing skipped or miscolored an isolated stem).
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected some verticals like col 16 1's and col 17 2's/4's), but isolation check or offset application failed for left-side stems.
 * Top/bottom pattern placement worked for upper parts (e.g., row 0/1 partial matches, row 5 9's match), but propagation stopped prematurely or didn't apply to lower singletons.
 * Middle extensions applied minimally (e.g., no horizontals from lower 1/2/4), suggesting pos_dict didn't capture them as middle or extend_middle only hit non-8 blocks immediately.
 * No overfills observed, but underfills dominate failures; count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions seem correct (identified singletons properly).
 * find_stems is helpful but may miss non-1/2 stems or short runs; is_isolated is essential but potentially too strict (e.g., if adjacent stems don't overlap vertically, it should pass—bug if it falsely rejects).
 * fill_horizontal is useful for propagation but doesn't handle vertical checks.
 * place_top_pattern and place_bottom_pattern are partially correct (anchor logic for s1/s2/s3 positions) but fail on propagation (e.g., checks all-blank but may not partial-fill correctly if singleton not blank).
 * extend_middle is broken/incomplete: Only horizontal from middle singletons, but expected shows vertical-like patterns (e.g., staggered horizontals at offsets), suggesting it needs to treat middle as mini-stems or patterns.
 * process_stems orders offsets/colors correctly for types but skips if offsets out-of-bounds; however, in training 2, it filled row 3 cols 14-22 as 4/2's correctly but missed left 6's—likely a separate stem not isolated.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct overall; it shows partial pattern fills (e.g., row 1: 9's in cols 4-7? Wait, row 0 has 1's at cols 4-5; row 1 9's cols 0-3 and 4=4? Inconsistent with singleton rules—singletons seem to be 1,3,4? But fills like row 2 9's cols 6-15 and 3's/2's/1's suggest top-pattern propagation from a row0 singleton, but colors mismatch expected s1/s2/s3 mapping).
 * Upper section: Row 4 full 6's cols 6-28 looks like a horizontal from stem offset, but row 5 full 7's suggests another, yet no vertical stems visible in input (test input not provided, but output implies over-propagation or wrong colors—7's may be pre-filled, but filling over?).
 * Lower section: Row 11 full 9's cols 0-23 then 2/4/7's staggered; row 12 6's cols 0-23 then 2/4; row 13 7's cols 0-23 then 2/4— this looks like bottom-pattern propagation upward, but staggered ends (e.g., 7's in row 12 col 28?) and row 24-28 mirroring upper suggest symmetric but incorrect color assignments (e.g., why 9's then 6's then 7's? Likely wrong s1/s2/s3 or offset misapplication; expected might stagger based on multiple singletons, but output fills too uniformly leftward).
 * Middle empties (rows 7-10, 16-23 all 8's) indicate missed middle extensions or no detected middle singletons (e.g., row 6 has 3's cols 4-5, but no horizontal spread).
 * No obvious overfills, but underfills in potential stem areas (e.g., col 4 has vertical 4/2/6/7/3/8..., suggesting a stem of mixed types not processed); output doesn't match puzzle logic as fills seem to ignore isolation (e.g., adjacent columns filled similarly without check).
 * Test has wider grid (29 cols?) with more pre-fills (e.g., row 2 has 9's and 3/2/1 clusters), implying complex interactions—output partially captures vertical propagation (e.g., row 4-5 horizontals) but fails on horizontal offsets from lower singletons (e.g., row 24 has 1's/4/2/9's but no full lines).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for simple top/bottom but not for intertwined stems/singletons—likely inherits training 2 bugs (e.g., no patterned horizontals in lower right).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly identified singletons (e.g., in train1, s1=1,s2=2,s3=3) and their positions, enabling basic pattern triggering.
 * Successfully filled some top/bottom 3-column propagations (e.g., train1 top with 2-3-4? but mismatched colors; bottom with 2-3-1 correctly in parts).
 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle similar to a nonogram or pattern-propagation challenge, where a partially filled grid (with numbers 1-9 as colors and 8 as blanks) must be completed by identifying three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each), detecting vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2), and applying specific filling rules like horizontal extensions, vertical propagations from top/bottom singletons, and isolated stem patterns to propagate colors logically without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors with count==1); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) of length >=4 in a column; type 1 stems (value=1) and type 2 (value=2) have opposite behaviors, with isolation checked against adjacent columns (c-1 or c+1) for opposite-type stems of equal or longer length that overlap vertically.
 * For isolated stems, fill horizontals at specific row offsets: type 1 uses offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; type 2 uses [0,3,length-2] with [s3,s2,s1]; extend left/right from the stem column until non-blank or edge.
 * Subtlety for type 1 stems: Check for a left-prefix (adjacent left column with >=2 consistent non-stem/non-blank cells); if present, fill an extra row (offset=2) rightward with s1 and set the left cell to the prefix color if it's blank/stem.
 * Top-row singletons (r==0) trigger diagonal-ish patterns: depending on which singleton (s1/s2/s3), select column offsets like [-4,-2,0] for s1, and propagate downward only if all pattern columns are blank or match the color in each row.
 * Bottom-row singletons (r==h-1) use asymmetric patterns: e.g., for s1 [0,1,4], propagate upward similarly, but offsets are irregular (e.g., negative for s3).
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right with their color until non-blank.
 * Propagation stops if a row can't be fully matched (any pattern column out-of-bounds or non-matching non-blank).
 * Subtle: Stem processing happens before singleton patterns, so it can pre-fill areas that affect later propagations; avoid overfilling by checking for 8 only.
 * Grids can be tall/narrow (e.g., 21x27 or 29 cols in test); ensure bounds checks (0 <= j < w).
 * No diagonal or complex interactions beyond stems/singletons; unfilled areas remain 8.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for top/bottom are color-ordered differently (top: [s3,s2,s1], bottom: [s1,s2,s3]); isolation requires no vertical overlap with qualifying opposite stems.

```
(Note: Similar propagate_bottom_pattern exists but propagates upward; process_stem_fills handles isolated stem horizontal fills with offsets and left-prefix logic; extend_middle_horizontal does simple left/right extension. These are all helpful for core logic but may need tweaks for overfilling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly handled Training example 1 by properly identifying singletons (e.g., assuming 3,6,9), stems, and propagations to fill the full expected grid without errors.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output overfilled horizontals in the bottom section—e.g., row 10 (0-indexed) has 4,1 followed by nine 3's extending right to col26, but expected has only 4,1 and blanks after (no 3's); row 11 has 4,1,3's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks; row 12 has 2,1, six 6's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks before six 6's? Wait, parsing shows generated extended 3's and misplaced 2's/4's in rows 10-18, likely due to incorrect stem isolation or offset filling in process_stem_fills allowing overlaps or wrong colors (e.g., s1=3? assuming singletons 1,3,6 or similar, but code sorted s1<s2<s3 and applied [s1,s2,s3] wrongly).
 * Stem processing pre-fills interfered with singleton patterns, causing extra fills in non-isolated areas (e.g., generated row 2 has extra 1's and 4's not in expected? No, row 2 matches, but bottom mismatches suggest non-isolated stems were processed anyway).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially (e.g., top fills like row0-1 3's and row3 6's match), but middle/bottom horizontals overextended (e.g., generated row14 has nine 9's, expected matches, but adjacent rows don't).
 * Function is_isolated seems correct but may miss subtle overlaps; process_stem_fills' left-prefix logic might trigger falsely, filling extras (unknown why in this case).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but propagate functions could be stricter on "can_fill" to prevent partial matches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It identifies singletons (likely 1,3,9 or similar, given fills) and applies some stem fills (e.g., row4-5 wide 6's and 7's from a type2 stem?), top/bottom patterns (e.g., row1-2 9's and 3's propagating down, row25-28 9's/6's/7's from bottom), and horizontals (e.g., row11 wide 9's), but overfills inconsistently—e.g., row2 has 9's then 3's/2's/1's clumped awkwardly without clear pattern match, row16 has 1,4 but no further propagation upward despite bottom rules; row7-10 are mostly blank but should propagate from nearby stems/singletons (e.g., col4 has 3's in row6 but no extension); row23-24 have isolated 1's/4's/2's without horizontal extension, suggesting missed middle singleton rule or bounds issues in wider 29-col grid; overall, it fills ~60% logically but leaves gaps (e.g., row6 3's not extended) and adds extras (e.g., row12 wide 9's may overstep isolation), so rules like stem offsets or pattern cols need adjustment for asymmetric grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of Train Input 1 vs. Output 1 and Train Input 2 vs. Output 2, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **both** examples. Only properties/components with direct, observable effects or transformations in **every** case are included. No high-level interpretations or puzzle solutions are provided. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact lengths or ordering rules) are noted as such. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated internal multi-pixel shapes like certain Yellow/Red/Green blocks that show no transformation; background uniformity; asymmetric spatial layout without specific effects) are excluded.

#### 1. **Border Position → Transformation of Single-Pixel Components**
   - **Components Involved**: Single-pixel (pixels=1, holes=0) non-Maroon blocks (e.g., Pink, Green, Light Blue, Orange, Blue).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: If a single-pixel block is positioned on a canvas border (x=0 for left, x=bbox_max_x for right, y=0 for top, y=bbox_max_y for bottom), its position triggers a transformation: extension inward by adding same-color pixels adjacent to it.
     - Left border (x=0): Extends right (horizontal, adjusts bbox to increase x-range).
     - Right border (x=max): Extends left (horizontal, adjusts bbox to decrease x-max).
     - Top border (y=0): Extends down (vertical, adjusts bbox to increase y-range).
     - Bottom border (y=max): Extends up (vertical, adjusts bbox to decrease y-max).
   - **Preserved Properties**: Color unchanged; holes remain 0.
   - **Changed Properties**: Bbox expands in the inward direction; pixels increase (from 1 to higher value).
   - **Consistency**: Occurs for **all** border single-pixel blocks in both trains (e.g., Train 1: Pink at x=28 extends left; Orange/Blue at y=25 extend up; Train 2: Green/Light Blue at x=0 extend right; Pink at y=0 extends down). No exceptions.
   - **Unknown**: Exact number of added pixels/length of extension (varies: e.g., +1 in one case, +4 in another, +8/+16 in others; no consistent rule identifiable from data).

#### 2. **Non-Border Position → Preservation of Components**
   - **Components Involved**: All non-Maroon blocks not on border (includes single-pixel internal blocks and all multi-pixel blocks, e.g., Yellow/Red/Green/Blue with pixels>1; internal singles like certain Yellow pixels=1).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Position (internal, not on any border) causes no transformation—components remain unchanged.
   - **Preserved Properties**: Color, bbox (exact coordinates), pixels (exact count), holes (remain 0).
   - **Consistency**: Applies to **all** such components in both trains (e.g., Train 1: All internal Yellow/Red/Green blocks preserved exactly; Train 2: All internal Yellow/Red/Blue blocks preserved exactly). No changes or extensions for these.

#### 3. **Border Single-Pixel Colors → New Component Creation (Color Propagation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Colors from border single-pixel blocks (e.g., Pink, Orange, Blue in Train 1; Green, Pink, Light Blue in Train 2) + Maroon.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Colors of border single-pixel blocks (from interaction #1) propagate to create entirely **new** blocks (not extensions of existing ones) in fill regions (often horizontal/vertical bars near borders or clusters). Maroon is consistently added as adjacent/intermediate blocks.
     - New blocks match the color of a border single-pixel block.
     - Maroon blocks are added next to or between these new colored blocks (e.g., as separators or fillers).
   - **Preserved Properties**: New blocks have holes=0; pixel counts vary but form solid bars (no holes/silhouettes).
   - **Changed/Added Properties**: Introduces new bboxes in previously empty/Maroon areas; pixels added (e.g., horizontal bars of 5–18 pixels).
   - **Consistency**: In both trains, **all** border single-pixel colors appear in new blocks (e.g., Train 1: New Pink/Orange/Blue bars created using border singles' colors, with Maroon adjacent; Train 2: New Green/Pink/Light Blue bars created using border singles' colors, with Maroon adjacent). No new blocks use colors absent from border singles (e.g., no new Green in Train 1, as no border Green single). Maroon always involved in fills.
   - **Unknown**: Exact positions of new blocks relative to originals (near borders/clusters, but placement varies); order/sequence of colors in fills (uses border colors + Maroon, but arrangement not identical); exact pixel counts for new blocks.

#### 4. **Maroon Holes Property → Reduction via Added Components**
   - **Components Involved**: Large Maroon block (encompassing bbox, high pixels, holes>0) + new small components from interactions #1 and #3.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Presence of holes>0 in large Maroon interacts with added new components (extensions and fills from border colors + Maroon small blocks), causing the holes property to transform.
   - **Preserved Properties**: Maroon color unchanged; overall bbox unchanged.
   - **Changed Properties**: Holes reduced to exactly 0; pixels decreased (space overwritten by new small components).
   - **Consistency**: In both trains, large Maroon starts with holes>0 (3 in Train 1, 2 in Train 2) and ends with holes=0; pixels decrease (695→435 in Train 1, 510→428 in Train 2) due to new components filling space. No cases where holes remain >0.
   - **Unknown**: Exact mechanism of hole reduction (e.g., how added components "close" holes topologically; consistent effect but not explainable from bbox/pixels alone).

#### 5. **Cluster Position → Location of New Fills**
   - **Components Involved**: Positions of small non-Maroon clusters (groups of adjacent/nearby blocks) + new fill components from #3.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Positions of existing clusters (e.g., upper-left, lower-right) affect where new fill blocks (from border colors + Maroon) are placed—fills appear adjacent to or bridging cluster positions (e.g., left-side clusters get left-side fills; top/right clusters get top/right fills).
   - **Preserved Properties**: None directly (affects placement only).
   - **Changed Properties**: New bboxes for fills are positioned near clusters (e.g., horizontal fills near top clusters, vertical near bottom/side).
   - **Consistency**: In both trains, new fills are placed relative to cluster locations (e.g., Train 1: Left/lower clusters → left vertical and top horizontal fills; Train 2: Left/top clusters → left horizontal and top-right vertical fills; right/lower clusters → right horizontal fills). No fills in irrelevant areas.
   - **Unknown**: Precise distance or bridging rule (fills are "near" but exact offsets vary; no consistent metric like Euclidean distance identifiable).

No other interactions (e.g., hole count → color changes; specific shape silhouettes/edges → movement; color → position shifts) are consistent across both examples—many vary or are absent in one train. No forced connections (e.g., no evidence of Yellow/Red/Green interacting beyond preservation).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:45:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (value 8) are populated with colors (integers 1-9) based on rules involving three unique singletons (colors appearing exactly once), horizontal extensions from them, and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2) that trigger patterned fills either in isolation or when adjacent. The goal is to propagate fills downward/upward or sideways from these elements while respecting existing colors and avoiding overwrites unless matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) must exist initially; if not, no fills occur—subtlety: counts exclude blanks (8), and singletons are sorted.
 * Top patterns: If a singleton is at row 0, it seeds a repeating horizontal triplet pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c: fills s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c, downward until mismatch), but only if columns are valid and cells are blank or match; patterns shift based on which singleton (s1/s2/s3) is the anchor.
 * Bottom patterns: Similar to top but upward from row h-1, with different column offsets (e.g., for s1 at bottom: s1 at c, s2 at c+1, s3 at c+4) and reversed direction.
 * Middle extensions: For non-edge singletons, fill horizontal runs of blanks left/right from the singleton's position with its color—subtlety: this is simple flood-fill but stops at non-blanks.
 * Stems: Vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s (type=1 or 2); processed after other steps, so stems can form dynamically.
 * Adjacent stems: If two stems of opposite types (1 and 2) are in neighboring columns and overlap >=3 rows, fill away from the longer/shorter one in the overlap at offsets [0,1,ol_len//2] with s1/s2/s3 (reversed for type 2), direction based on relative column position—subtlety: only if the current stem's length >= adjacent's; fills stop at non-blanks.
 * Isolated stems: For type 1, fill at offsets [1,3,5] with s1/s2/s3 horizontally both directions; for type 2, offsets [0, length//2, length-2] with s3/s2/s1—subtlety: for type 2 at offset 0, additional downward fills in the next row based on horizontal reach (e.g., if right side reaches a filled cell, fill below the blanks to that point, and mirror opposites).
 * Order matters: Top/bottom/middle first, then stems (stems may use prior fills); no overwrites unless matching; grid is mutable copy.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns don't wrap edges; fills are row-by-row until break on mismatch; isolated type 2 has complex "reached" logic for next-row mirroring (e.g., fill below reached segments and set opposites); adjacent fills are only in overlap and away direction; potential for stems to be created by prior fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns as-is; singletons not at edges skip top/bottom; short overlaps (<3) skip adjacent processing; offsets may exceed length, so unique/sorted handling; type 2 offset 0 special fill checks existing fills in current row to determine next-row propagation.
 * General: Colors seem thematic (1/2 stems, 3-7 fills, 9 sometimes appears but not in singletons here); no diagonal or other interactions; all fills are horizontal or vertical-aligned to anchors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single attempt provided) correctly identifies singletons via counting non-blanks and positions them, which works for seeding patterns if they exist at edges.
 * Top/bottom pattern processing works partially: in train1, it fills some downward/upward triplets (e.g., generated has 2,3 in row3 col18-19 matching expected, and 2,4 in row6), but fails on specifics like row2 col17-19 (generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3? wait, minor; actually row3 generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3, but row2 generated 2,4 vs expected 2,4—discrepancy in presentation but seems partial match; however, overfills or misses in lower sections).
 * Middle extensions work for horizontal fills from non-edge singletons, but in train1, it doesn't appear to trigger much (e.g., singleton 1 at row10 col2 extends? but generated doesn't show full horizontals).
 * Stem finding is helpful and detects long vertical 1/2 runs, but processing fails: in train1, isolated stems like bottom 1-stem and 2-stem get partial horizontal fills (e.g., row16-17 has 4,3,3,3,3,4 and 2,2,2,2,2,2,4 matching expected), but type2 offset0 special downward mirroring is broken (e.g., row18 has 8,1,5 vs expected 8,1,5—minor, but later rows like row20 has 4,2,6,6,6,6,6 vs expected 4,2,6,6,6,6,6; actually mismatches in row21: generated 4,2,6 vs expected 3,2,8—wrong color s1=1 vs s3=3?); adjacent stems not handled well (train1 has no clear adjacents, but overfills elsewhere).
 * In train2, singletons (1,3,6?) processed poorly: top/bottom patterns miss (e.g., generated fills 1,2 vertical but expected has more 3/6 extensions); stems like left 3/6/9 verticals get no fills, while right 1/2/4 get partial but wrong (row11 generated 2,1,3,3,3,... vs expected 4,1,3,3,3—wrong starting color); isolated stem logic applies incorrectly, leading to extra 1/2 fills in empty areas.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure (singletons + stems) but bugs in pattern offsets (e.g., bottom pat_cols for s3 wrong?), adjacent overlap calc (skips valid?), and type2 special fill (reach detection flawed, e.g., temp_j unused, mirroring opposites incorrectly sets non-singleton colors); no handling for post-fill stem recreation (runs after all processes?); unhelpful: process_stems has redundant direction code for adjacent (if step==-1 repeated); the whole adjacent block skips if length < other_len but doesn't swap perspective.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills and mismatches expected patterns based on mental simulation of rules.
 * Singletons likely 1,2,4 (appear once: 1 at row0 col4-5? wait input has two 1s? wait, input row0 has two 1s, but counts would see multiples—program returns early if !=3 singletons, but generated fills anyway? Bug: perhaps counts wrong or fills ignore check.
 * Top patterns should seed from potential top singleton (e.g., if 1 at row0 col4, but duplicates; mental: no clear top singleton, so minimal top fills; generated has row1 4,1 but input already has, then row2 4,2,9...—seems partial match but adds 9s wrongly.
 * Stems: Clear type2 stem at col5 rows0-6 (1? wait input has 1,1 at row0 col4-5, but 2 at row2-4 col5? Mixed; long 7-stem? No, stems only 1/2; generated ignores, fills unrelated 9/7 elsewhere (e.g., row2 has 9s extended wrongly from input 9s).
 * Bottom/middle: Input has bottom-ish 6/7/9, but generated adds 1,4 at row15-16 wrongly; horizontal extensions from 2/4 at row14-15 partial but adds extra 7s.
 * Adjacent stems missing: Potential col4 (3s short) and col5 (2s) not adjacent properly; generated row25-28 has 4,2,9/7 but expected likely mirrors from type2 offset0 (downward from row4 col5 2, but input sparse).
 * Overall, fills like row12 9s extended left/right from input but shouldn't (not singleton/stem triggered); test has more colors (7,9) not in singletons, so rules may need generalization beyond s1/s2/s3 for fills—program assumes only s1-3 colors, leading to blanks remaining or wrong propagation; does not make sense as it creates inconsistent patterns (e.g., isolated 7-stem in row4 not processed as stem since !=1/2).

[2025-09-30 23:45:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

# Existing count function is helpful for identifying singletons pre- and post-fill
def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

# Helpful for finding singleton positions after stem processing
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> dict:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (similar to a logic or pattern-completion puzzle like Fillomino or a variant of nonogram with color rules) where a partial grid with numbers representing colors (1,2,3,4,6,7,9) and blanks (8) must be completed by propagating fills based on detected patterns from unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (runs of 1 or 2 of length >=4). The goal is to fill blanks horizontally and vertically according to specific offset-based rules triggered by isolated stems and singleton positions at the top, bottom, or middle of the grid, ensuring no overfills or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors appearing once each); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent mapping (e.g., s1=1, s2=3, s3=6 in training example 2).
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) in a column, length >=4; only "isolated" stems (no overlapping adjacent stems of the opposite type in neighboring columns) trigger horizontal fills at specific row offsets: for type 1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for type 2, offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1] (where l=stem length)—fills propagate left/right until non-blank or edge.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singletons): Trigger a 3-column pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c>=4: cols [c-4,c-3,c] with [s3,s2,s1]) and propagate downward while rows are all blank in those columns; partial fill starts at row 0.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singletons): Similar but mirrored (e.g., for s1 at c: [c,c+1,c+4] with [s1,s2,s3]), propagate upward; partial fill at bottom row; anchors adjust for s2/s3 positions to fit left/right constraints.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom): Extend horizontally left/right from the singleton's position until non-blank or edge, but only in that row—no vertical propagation.
 * Order matters: Process stems first (as they may create or block patterns), then top patterns, bottom patterns, then middle extensions; avoid filling over existing non-blanks.
 * Subtleties: Patterns may not fill full height if blocked; stems must be exactly isolated (no vertical overlap with opposite-type adjacent stems); offsets can exceed grid height (skip invalid rows); colors like 4,6,7,9 may be pre-filled and influence isolation/blocking; horizontal fills stop at edges or non-8; singletons can be pre-filled in stems or patterns.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; singletons not in expected positions (e.g., too left for anchors) skip pattern placement; multiple singletons may trigger overlapping fills, but propagation checks for all-blank rows prevent conflicts.
 * Potential misses: Not handling partial vertical propagation correctly (e.g., stopping when a pattern row has a non-8); incorrect offset calculations for stems (e.g., l-2 may be invalid); assuming all singletons trigger patterns when only top/bottom do; not sorting singletons leading to color mismatches; stems of length exactly 4 may have offset l-2=2, which could overlap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely simple top/bottom or stem case).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated incorrect horizontal fills from stems (e.g., row 3 left side unfilled as 8's, but expected 6's across cols 0-4; row 1 has 3's instead of expected 3's only partially? Wait, row 1 matches, but row 3 mismatch suggests wrong offset/color for a type-2 stem or isolation failure).
 * In training 2 generated vs expected: Lower section (rows ~10-17, cols ~16-18) shows repeated vertical 2/1/4 but no horizontal extensions or patterned fills (e.g., expected row 11 cols 18-26=3's, row 12=6's, row 14=9's from a bottom or middle pattern, but generated leaves them 8's—likely because place_bottom_pattern or extend_middle didn't trigger due to singleton positions not at exact bottom or incorrect anchor checks; also row 3 cols 0-4=8's vs expected 6's, indicating stem processing skipped or miscolored an isolated stem).
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected some verticals like col 16 1's and col 17 2's/4's), but isolation check or offset application failed for left-side stems.
 * Top/bottom pattern placement worked for upper parts (e.g., row 0/1 partial matches, row 5 9's match), but propagation stopped prematurely or didn't apply to lower singletons.
 * Middle extensions applied minimally (e.g., no horizontals from lower 1/2/4), suggesting pos_dict didn't capture them as middle or extend_middle only hit non-8 blocks immediately.
 * No overfills observed, but underfills dominate failures; count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions seem correct (identified singletons properly).
 * find_stems is helpful but may miss non-1/2 stems or short runs; is_isolated is essential but potentially too strict (e.g., if adjacent stems don't overlap vertically, it should pass—bug if it falsely rejects).
 * fill_horizontal is useful for propagation but doesn't handle vertical checks.
 * place_top_pattern and place_bottom_pattern are partially correct (anchor logic for s1/s2/s3 positions) but fail on propagation (e.g., checks all-blank but may not partial-fill correctly if singleton not blank).
 * extend_middle is broken/incomplete: Only horizontal from middle singletons, but expected shows vertical-like patterns (e.g., staggered horizontals at offsets), suggesting it needs to treat middle as mini-stems or patterns.
 * process_stems orders offsets/colors correctly for types but skips if offsets out-of-bounds; however, in training 2, it filled row 3 cols 14-22 as 4/2's correctly but missed left 6's—likely a separate stem not isolated.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct overall; it shows partial pattern fills (e.g., row 1: 9's in cols 4-7? Wait, row 0 has 1's at cols 4-5; row 1 9's cols 0-3 and 4=4? Inconsistent with singleton rules—singletons seem to be 1,3,4? But fills like row 2 9's cols 6-15 and 3's/2's/1's suggest top-pattern propagation from a row0 singleton, but colors mismatch expected s1/s2/s3 mapping).
 * Upper section: Row 4 full 6's cols 6-28 looks like a horizontal from stem offset, but row 5 full 7's suggests another, yet no vertical stems visible in input (test input not provided, but output implies over-propagation or wrong colors—7's may be pre-filled, but filling over?).
 * Lower section: Row 11 full 9's cols 0-23 then 2/4/7's staggered; row 12 6's cols 0-23 then 2/4; row 13 7's cols 0-23 then 2/4— this looks like bottom-pattern propagation upward, but staggered ends (e.g., 7's in row 12 col 28?) and row 24-28 mirroring upper suggest symmetric but incorrect color assignments (e.g., why 9's then 6's then 7's? Likely wrong s1/s2/s3 or offset misapplication; expected might stagger based on multiple singletons, but output fills too uniformly leftward).
 * Middle empties (rows 7-10, 16-23 all 8's) indicate missed middle extensions or no detected middle singletons (e.g., row 6 has 3's cols 4-5, but no horizontal spread).
 * No obvious overfills, but underfills in potential stem areas (e.g., col 4 has vertical 4/2/6/7/3/8..., suggesting a stem of mixed types not processed); output doesn't match puzzle logic as fills seem to ignore isolation (e.g., adjacent columns filled similarly without check).
 * Test has wider grid (29 cols?) with more pre-fills (e.g., row 2 has 9's and 3/2/1 clusters), implying complex interactions—output partially captures vertical propagation (e.g., row 4-5 horizontals) but fails on horizontal offsets from lower singletons (e.g., row 24 has 1's/4/2/9's but no full lines).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for simple top/bottom but not for intertwined stems/singletons—likely inherits training 2 bugs (e.g., no patterned horizontals in lower right).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (value 8) are populated with colors (integers 1-9) based on rules involving three unique singletons (colors appearing exactly once), horizontal extensions from them, and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2) that trigger patterned fills either in isolation or when adjacent. The goal is to propagate fills downward/upward or sideways from these elements while respecting existing colors and avoiding overwrites unless matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) must exist initially; if not, no fills occur—subtlety: counts exclude blanks (8), and singletons are sorted.
 * Top patterns: If a singleton is at row 0, it seeds a repeating horizontal triplet pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c: fills s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c, downward until mismatch), but only if columns are valid and cells are blank or match; patterns shift based on which singleton (s1/s2/s3) is the anchor.
 * Bottom patterns: Similar to top but upward from row h-1, with different column offsets (e.g., for s1 at bottom: s1 at c, s2 at c+1, s3 at c+4) and reversed direction.
 * Middle extensions: For non-edge singletons, fill horizontal runs of blanks left/right from the singleton's position with its color—subtlety: this is simple flood-fill but stops at non-blanks.
 * Stems: Vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s (type=1 or 2); processed after other steps, so stems can form dynamically.
 * Adjacent stems: If two stems of opposite types (1 and 2) are in neighboring columns and overlap >=3 rows, fill away from the longer/shorter one in the overlap at offsets [0,1,ol_len//2] with s1/s2/s3 (reversed for type 2), direction based on relative column position—subtlety: only if the current stem's length >= adjacent's; fills stop at non-blanks.
 * Isolated stems: For type 1, fill at offsets [1,3,5] with s1/s2/s3 horizontally both directions; for type 2, offsets [0, length//2, length-2] with s3/s2/s1—subtlety: for type 2 at offset 0, additional downward fills in the next row based on horizontal reach (e.g., if right side reaches a filled cell, fill below the blanks to that point, and mirror opposites).
 * Order matters: Top/bottom/middle first, then stems (stems may use prior fills); no overwrites unless matching; grid is mutable copy.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns don't wrap edges; fills are row-by-row until break on mismatch; isolated type 2 has complex "reached" logic for next-row mirroring (e.g., fill below reached segments and set opposites); adjacent fills are only in overlap and away direction; potential for stems to be created by prior fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns as-is; singletons not at edges skip top/bottom; short overlaps (<3) skip adjacent processing; offsets may exceed length, so unique/sorted handling; type 2 offset 0 special fill checks existing fills in current row to determine next-row propagation.
 * General: Colors seem thematic (1/2 stems, 3-7 fills, 9 sometimes appears but not in singletons here); no diagonal or other interactions; all fills are horizontal or vertical-aligned to anchors.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single attempt provided) correctly identifies singletons via counting non-blanks and positions them, which works for seeding patterns if they exist at edges.
 * Top/bottom pattern processing works partially: in train1, it fills some downward/upward triplets (e.g., generated has 2,3 in row3 col18-19 matching expected, and 2,4 in row6), but fails on specifics like row2 col17-19 (generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3? wait, minor; actually row3 generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3, but row2 generated 2,4 vs expected 2,4—discrepancy in presentation but seems partial match; however, overfills or misses in lower sections).
 * Middle extensions work for horizontal fills from non-edge singletons, but in train1, it doesn't appear to trigger much (e.g., singleton 1 at row10 col2 extends? but generated doesn't show full horizontals).
 * Stem finding is helpful and detects long vertical 1/2 runs, but processing fails: in train1, isolated stems like bottom 1-stem and 2-stem get partial horizontal fills (e.g., row16-17 has 4,3,3,3,3,4 and 2,2,2,2,2,2,4 matching expected), but type2 offset0 special downward mirroring is broken (e.g., row18 has 8,1,5 vs expected 8,1,5—minor, but later rows like row20 has 4,2,6,6,6,6,6 vs expected 4,2,6,6,6,6,6; actually mismatches in row21: generated 4,2,6 vs expected 3,2,8—wrong color s1=1 vs s3=3?); adjacent stems not handled well (train1 has no clear adjacents, but overfills elsewhere).
 * In train2, singletons (1,3,6?) processed poorly: top/bottom patterns miss (e.g., generated fills 1,2 vertical but expected has more 3/6 extensions); stems like left 3/6/9 verticals get no fills, while right 1/2/4 get partial but wrong (row11 generated 2,1,3,3,3,... vs expected 4,1,3,3,3—wrong starting color); isolated stem logic applies incorrectly, leading to extra 1/2 fills in empty areas.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure (singletons + stems) but bugs in pattern offsets (e.g., bottom pat_cols for s3 wrong?), adjacent overlap calc (skips valid?), and type2 special fill (reach detection flawed, e.g., temp_j unused, mirroring opposites incorrectly sets non-singleton colors); no handling for post-fill stem recreation (runs after all processes?); unhelpful: process_stems has redundant direction code for adjacent (if step==-1 repeated); the whole adjacent block skips if length < other_len but doesn't swap perspective.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills and mismatches expected patterns based on mental simulation of rules.
 * Singletons likely 1,2,4 (appear once: 1 at row0 col4-5? wait input has two 1s? wait, input row0 has two 1s, but counts would see multiples—program returns early if !=3 singletons, but generated fills anyway? Bug: perhaps counts wrong or fills ignore check.
 * Top patterns should seed from potential top singleton (e.g., if 1 at row0 col4, but duplicates; mental: no clear top singleton, so minimal top fills; generated has row1 4,1 but input already has, then row2 4,2,9...—seems partial match but adds 9s wrongly.
 * Stems: Clear type2 stem at col5 rows0-6 (1? wait input has 1,1 at row0 col4-5, but 2 at row2-4 col5? Mixed; long 7-stem? No, stems only 1/2; generated ignores, fills unrelated 9/7 elsewhere (e.g., row2 has 9s extended wrongly from input 9s).
 * Bottom/middle: Input has bottom-ish 6/7/9, but generated adds 1,4 at row15-16 wrongly; horizontal extensions from 2/4 at row14-15 partial but adds extra 7s.
 * Adjacent stems missing: Potential col4 (3s short) and col5 (2s) not adjacent properly; generated row25-28 has 4,2,9/7 but expected likely mirrors from type2 offset0 (downward from row4 col5 2, but input sparse).
 * Overall, fills like row12 9s extended left/right from input but shouldn't (not singleton/stem triggered); test has more colors (7,9) not in singletons, so rules may need generalization beyond s1/s2/s3 for fills—program assumes only s1-3 colors, leading to blanks remaining or wrong propagation; does not make sense as it creates inconsistent patterns (e.g., isolated 7-stem in row4 not processed as stem since !=1/2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly identified singletons (e.g., in train1, s1=1,s2=2,s3=3) and their positions, enabling basic pattern triggering.
 * Successfully filled some top/bottom 3-column propagations (e.g., train1 top with 2-3-4? but mismatched colors; bottom with 2-3-1 correctly in parts).
 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle similar to a nonogram or pattern-propagation challenge, where a partially filled grid (with numbers 1-9 as colors and 8 as blanks) must be completed by identifying three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each), detecting vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2), and applying specific filling rules like horizontal extensions, vertical propagations from top/bottom singletons, and isolated stem patterns to propagate colors logically without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors with count==1); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) of length >=4 in a column; type 1 stems (value=1) and type 2 (value=2) have opposite behaviors, with isolation checked against adjacent columns (c-1 or c+1) for opposite-type stems of equal or longer length that overlap vertically.
 * For isolated stems, fill horizontals at specific row offsets: type 1 uses offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; type 2 uses [0,3,length-2] with [s3,s2,s1]; extend left/right from the stem column until non-blank or edge.
 * Subtlety for type 1 stems: Check for a left-prefix (adjacent left column with >=2 consistent non-stem/non-blank cells); if present, fill an extra row (offset=2) rightward with s1 and set the left cell to the prefix color if it's blank/stem.
 * Top-row singletons (r==0) trigger diagonal-ish patterns: depending on which singleton (s1/s2/s3), select column offsets like [-4,-2,0] for s1, and propagate downward only if all pattern columns are blank or match the color in each row.
 * Bottom-row singletons (r==h-1) use asymmetric patterns: e.g., for s1 [0,1,4], propagate upward similarly, but offsets are irregular (e.g., negative for s3).
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right with their color until non-blank.
 * Propagation stops if a row can't be fully matched (any pattern column out-of-bounds or non-matching non-blank).
 * Subtle: Stem processing happens before singleton patterns, so it can pre-fill areas that affect later propagations; avoid overfilling by checking for 8 only.
 * Grids can be tall/narrow (e.g., 21x27 or 29 cols in test); ensure bounds checks (0 <= j < w).
 * No diagonal or complex interactions beyond stems/singletons; unfilled areas remain 8.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for top/bottom are color-ordered differently (top: [s3,s2,s1], bottom: [s1,s2,s3]); isolation requires no vertical overlap with qualifying opposite stems.

```
(Note: Similar propagate_bottom_pattern exists but propagates upward; process_stem_fills handles isolated stem horizontal fills with offsets and left-prefix logic; extend_middle_horizontal does simple left/right extension. These are all helpful for core logic but may need tweaks for overfilling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly handled Training example 1 by properly identifying singletons (e.g., assuming 3,6,9), stems, and propagations to fill the full expected grid without errors.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output overfilled horizontals in the bottom section—e.g., row 10 (0-indexed) has 4,1 followed by nine 3's extending right to col26, but expected has only 4,1 and blanks after (no 3's); row 11 has 4,1,3's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks; row 12 has 2,1, six 6's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks before six 6's? Wait, parsing shows generated extended 3's and misplaced 2's/4's in rows 10-18, likely due to incorrect stem isolation or offset filling in process_stem_fills allowing overlaps or wrong colors (e.g., s1=3? assuming singletons 1,3,6 or similar, but code sorted s1<s2<s3 and applied [s1,s2,s3] wrongly).
 * Stem processing pre-fills interfered with singleton patterns, causing extra fills in non-isolated areas (e.g., generated row 2 has extra 1's and 4's not in expected? No, row 2 matches, but bottom mismatches suggest non-isolated stems were processed anyway).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially (e.g., top fills like row0-1 3's and row3 6's match), but middle/bottom horizontals overextended (e.g., generated row14 has nine 9's, expected matches, but adjacent rows don't).
 * Function is_isolated seems correct but may miss subtle overlaps; process_stem_fills' left-prefix logic might trigger falsely, filling extras (unknown why in this case).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but propagate functions could be stricter on "can_fill" to prevent partial matches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It identifies singletons (likely 1,3,9 or similar, given fills) and applies some stem fills (e.g., row4-5 wide 6's and 7's from a type2 stem?), top/bottom patterns (e.g., row1-2 9's and 3's propagating down, row25-28 9's/6's/7's from bottom), and horizontals (e.g., row11 wide 9's), but overfills inconsistently—e.g., row2 has 9's then 3's/2's/1's clumped awkwardly without clear pattern match, row16 has 1,4 but no further propagation upward despite bottom rules; row7-10 are mostly blank but should propagate from nearby stems/singletons (e.g., col4 has 3's in row6 but no extension); row23-24 have isolated 1's/4's/2's without horizontal extension, suggesting missed middle singleton rule or bounds issues in wider 29-col grid; overall, it fills ~60% logically but leaves gaps (e.g., row6 3's not extended) and adds extras (e.g., row12 wide 9's may overstep isolation), so rules like stem offsets or pattern cols need adjustment for asymmetric grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:59:11] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in blank cells (represented by 8) based on patterns derived from three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each) and vertical "stem" structures (long runs of specific values like 1 or 2). The filling rules involve propagating patterns from top/bottom singletons, horizontal extensions in middles, and interactions between adjacent stems, while preserving existing non-blank cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count 1, excluding 8); if not, return the grid unchanged—subtlety: counts only non-8 cells, and singletons are sorted as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singleton) propagate downward in diagonal-ish column offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c-4, c-2, c with colors s3,s2,s1), but only if all three columns are blank in a row; must check bounds and stop if a row can't be fully blank-matched.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singleton) propagate upward with different offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c, c+1, c+4 with colors s1,s2,s3), but only fill if the target row's three columns are entirely blank; direction reverses from top.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) extend horizontally left/right by filling contiguous blanks in the same row with the singleton's color.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 identical cells of 1 or 2; pair adjacent stems of opposite types (1 and 2) if overlapping in rows and neighboring columns, then fill horizontal extensions at specific row offsets (e.g., 0,2,4 for type 1 rightward) with singleton colors in order (s1,s2,s3 or reverse).
 * Isolated stems fill horizontal blanks left/right at offsets, but without direction preference; cap extensions for type 2 stems fill left if above matches and left is blank.
 * Subtlety: Stem filling computes left/right blank lengths but only fills in the "direction" if paired, otherwise opportunistically left or right; offsets vary by type and pairing (e.g., [0,3,length-2] for unpaired type 2).
 * After all processes, re-find stems for cap extensions, as prior fills might create new ones.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns stop propagating if a row has partial matches (must be all blank or all matching); bounds checking prevents out-of-grid access; stems ignore 8s and other values, only count consecutive 1s/2s.
 * Overall: Preserve non-8 cells; output is a deep copy of input with only 8s potentially filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts
```
(This correctly counts non-blank occurrences per color, essential for identifying singletons.)

```python
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```
(This maps singletons to their (row, col) positions, crucial for pattern starting points.)

```python
def find_stems(g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    runs = []
    for col in range(w):
        i = 0
        while i < h:
            val = g[i][col]
            if val == 1 or val == 2:
                cl = val
                start_i = i
                i += 1
                while i < h and g[i][col] == cl:
                    i += 1
                length = i - start_i
                if length >= 4:
                    runs.append((start_i, i, col, cl))
            else:
                i += 1
    return runs
```
(This extracts vertical stem runs of 1/2 >=4 long as (start_row, end_row, col, type), useful for pairing and offset-based filling; re-call after other fills as stems can emerge.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a structured approach: identifies singletons, propagates top/bottom/middle patterns, handles stems with pairing and offsets, and adds cap extensions—shows good high-level understanding of rules like singleton sorting, pattern offsets, and stem interactions.
 * What worked: Core logic for counting singletons, finding positions, and basic stem detection is sound; middle horizontal extension and top/bottom propagation skeletons are mostly correct in intent (e.g., checking blanks before filling, stopping on mismatches).
 * What didn't work: Complete failure due to execution error ("name 'g' is not defined") in get_pat_cols, caused by referencing len(g[0]) without g in scope—blocks all runs; bottom pattern filling has flawed propagation (fills upward but checks blanks incorrectly, potentially overfills); stem filling logic is incomplete/buggy (e.g., offsets for paired stems use hardcoded [0,2,4] etc. but don't always align with colors; isolated fills don't prioritize direction well; right/left length computation is done but filling loops have off-by-one risks or don't use lengths fully).
 * process_top_patterns partially works for downward propagation but skips if bounds invalid; process_bottom_patterns has wrong offsets/colors for bottom (e.g., for s1: [c, c+1, c+4] seems arbitrary, not matching top symmetry) and upward check uses all blanks but fills unconditionally in loop.
 * process_stems overcomplicates pairing (searches all stems but doesn't handle multiple pairs) and offset selection (e.g., for type 2 unpaired: [0,3,length-2] may exceed grid); filling only does one side even if both available.
 * process_cap_extensions is a good idea but only handles left for type 2 and assumes sr>0 without full checks.
 * process_middle is simple and likely correct for horizontal blanks.
 * Overall, no successful runs, so can't verify filling accuracy; unhelpful/broken: get_pat_cols (scoping error, plus asymmetric offsets for top/bottom that may not match puzzle intent); process_bottom_patterns (logic flaws in propagation direction/checks).

**Test output:**
 * All attempts (training 1, training 2, test) resulted in ERROR - Execution error: name 'g' is not defined, due to the scoping issue in get_pat_cols—nothing was generated, so outputs do not make sense or match expected filled grids.
 * Since no actual grid output was produced, can't compare to correct solution, but this error prevents any validation; expected test output should be a filled grid with patterns from singletons/stems, but instead it's unusable—likely the test has singletons and stems that would propagate fills, but code crash hides this.
 * The error is consistent across examples, indicating a fundamental code structure flaw rather than input-specific; fixing scope would allow checking if fills match (e.g., test probably expects specific diagonal-ish fills from top/bottom and horizontal from stems, but current offsets/colors may still mismatch subtly).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

# Existing count function is helpful for identifying singletons pre- and post-fill
def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

# Helpful for finding singleton positions after stem processing
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> dict:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (similar to a logic or pattern-completion puzzle like Fillomino or a variant of nonogram with color rules) where a partial grid with numbers representing colors (1,2,3,4,6,7,9) and blanks (8) must be completed by propagating fills based on detected patterns from unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (runs of 1 or 2 of length >=4). The goal is to fill blanks horizontally and vertically according to specific offset-based rules triggered by isolated stems and singleton positions at the top, bottom, or middle of the grid, ensuring no overfills or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors appearing once each); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent mapping (e.g., s1=1, s2=3, s3=6 in training example 2).
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) in a column, length >=4; only "isolated" stems (no overlapping adjacent stems of the opposite type in neighboring columns) trigger horizontal fills at specific row offsets: for type 1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for type 2, offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1] (where l=stem length)—fills propagate left/right until non-blank or edge.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singletons): Trigger a 3-column pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c>=4: cols [c-4,c-3,c] with [s3,s2,s1]) and propagate downward while rows are all blank in those columns; partial fill starts at row 0.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singletons): Similar but mirrored (e.g., for s1 at c: [c,c+1,c+4] with [s1,s2,s3]), propagate upward; partial fill at bottom row; anchors adjust for s2/s3 positions to fit left/right constraints.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom): Extend horizontally left/right from the singleton's position until non-blank or edge, but only in that row—no vertical propagation.
 * Order matters: Process stems first (as they may create or block patterns), then top patterns, bottom patterns, then middle extensions; avoid filling over existing non-blanks.
 * Subtleties: Patterns may not fill full height if blocked; stems must be exactly isolated (no vertical overlap with opposite-type adjacent stems); offsets can exceed grid height (skip invalid rows); colors like 4,6,7,9 may be pre-filled and influence isolation/blocking; horizontal fills stop at edges or non-8; singletons can be pre-filled in stems or patterns.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; singletons not in expected positions (e.g., too left for anchors) skip pattern placement; multiple singletons may trigger overlapping fills, but propagation checks for all-blank rows prevent conflicts.
 * Potential misses: Not handling partial vertical propagation correctly (e.g., stopping when a pattern row has a non-8); incorrect offset calculations for stems (e.g., l-2 may be invalid); assuming all singletons trigger patterns when only top/bottom do; not sorting singletons leading to color mismatches; stems of length exactly 4 may have offset l-2=2, which could overlap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely simple top/bottom or stem case).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated incorrect horizontal fills from stems (e.g., row 3 left side unfilled as 8's, but expected 6's across cols 0-4; row 1 has 3's instead of expected 3's only partially? Wait, row 1 matches, but row 3 mismatch suggests wrong offset/color for a type-2 stem or isolation failure).
 * In training 2 generated vs expected: Lower section (rows ~10-17, cols ~16-18) shows repeated vertical 2/1/4 but no horizontal extensions or patterned fills (e.g., expected row 11 cols 18-26=3's, row 12=6's, row 14=9's from a bottom or middle pattern, but generated leaves them 8's—likely because place_bottom_pattern or extend_middle didn't trigger due to singleton positions not at exact bottom or incorrect anchor checks; also row 3 cols 0-4=8's vs expected 6's, indicating stem processing skipped or miscolored an isolated stem).
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected some verticals like col 16 1's and col 17 2's/4's), but isolation check or offset application failed for left-side stems.
 * Top/bottom pattern placement worked for upper parts (e.g., row 0/1 partial matches, row 5 9's match), but propagation stopped prematurely or didn't apply to lower singletons.
 * Middle extensions applied minimally (e.g., no horizontals from lower 1/2/4), suggesting pos_dict didn't capture them as middle or extend_middle only hit non-8 blocks immediately.
 * No overfills observed, but underfills dominate failures; count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions seem correct (identified singletons properly).
 * find_stems is helpful but may miss non-1/2 stems or short runs; is_isolated is essential but potentially too strict (e.g., if adjacent stems don't overlap vertically, it should pass—bug if it falsely rejects).
 * fill_horizontal is useful for propagation but doesn't handle vertical checks.
 * place_top_pattern and place_bottom_pattern are partially correct (anchor logic for s1/s2/s3 positions) but fail on propagation (e.g., checks all-blank but may not partial-fill correctly if singleton not blank).
 * extend_middle is broken/incomplete: Only horizontal from middle singletons, but expected shows vertical-like patterns (e.g., staggered horizontals at offsets), suggesting it needs to treat middle as mini-stems or patterns.
 * process_stems orders offsets/colors correctly for types but skips if offsets out-of-bounds; however, in training 2, it filled row 3 cols 14-22 as 4/2's correctly but missed left 6's—likely a separate stem not isolated.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct overall; it shows partial pattern fills (e.g., row 1: 9's in cols 4-7? Wait, row 0 has 1's at cols 4-5; row 1 9's cols 0-3 and 4=4? Inconsistent with singleton rules—singletons seem to be 1,3,4? But fills like row 2 9's cols 6-15 and 3's/2's/1's suggest top-pattern propagation from a row0 singleton, but colors mismatch expected s1/s2/s3 mapping).
 * Upper section: Row 4 full 6's cols 6-28 looks like a horizontal from stem offset, but row 5 full 7's suggests another, yet no vertical stems visible in input (test input not provided, but output implies over-propagation or wrong colors—7's may be pre-filled, but filling over?).
 * Lower section: Row 11 full 9's cols 0-23 then 2/4/7's staggered; row 12 6's cols 0-23 then 2/4; row 13 7's cols 0-23 then 2/4— this looks like bottom-pattern propagation upward, but staggered ends (e.g., 7's in row 12 col 28?) and row 24-28 mirroring upper suggest symmetric but incorrect color assignments (e.g., why 9's then 6's then 7's? Likely wrong s1/s2/s3 or offset misapplication; expected might stagger based on multiple singletons, but output fills too uniformly leftward).
 * Middle empties (rows 7-10, 16-23 all 8's) indicate missed middle extensions or no detected middle singletons (e.g., row 6 has 3's cols 4-5, but no horizontal spread).
 * No obvious overfills, but underfills in potential stem areas (e.g., col 4 has vertical 4/2/6/7/3/8..., suggesting a stem of mixed types not processed); output doesn't match puzzle logic as fills seem to ignore isolation (e.g., adjacent columns filled similarly without check).
 * Test has wider grid (29 cols?) with more pre-fills (e.g., row 2 has 9's and 3/2/1 clusters), implying complex interactions—output partially captures vertical propagation (e.g., row 4-5 horizontals) but fails on horizontal offsets from lower singletons (e.g., row 24 has 1's/4/2/9's but no full lines).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for simple top/bottom but not for intertwined stems/singletons—likely inherits training 2 bugs (e.g., no patterned horizontals in lower right).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (value 8) are populated with colors (integers 1-9) based on rules involving three unique singletons (colors appearing exactly once), horizontal extensions from them, and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2) that trigger patterned fills either in isolation or when adjacent. The goal is to propagate fills downward/upward or sideways from these elements while respecting existing colors and avoiding overwrites unless matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) must exist initially; if not, no fills occur—subtlety: counts exclude blanks (8), and singletons are sorted.
 * Top patterns: If a singleton is at row 0, it seeds a repeating horizontal triplet pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c: fills s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c, downward until mismatch), but only if columns are valid and cells are blank or match; patterns shift based on which singleton (s1/s2/s3) is the anchor.
 * Bottom patterns: Similar to top but upward from row h-1, with different column offsets (e.g., for s1 at bottom: s1 at c, s2 at c+1, s3 at c+4) and reversed direction.
 * Middle extensions: For non-edge singletons, fill horizontal runs of blanks left/right from the singleton's position with its color—subtlety: this is simple flood-fill but stops at non-blanks.
 * Stems: Vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s (type=1 or 2); processed after other steps, so stems can form dynamically.
 * Adjacent stems: If two stems of opposite types (1 and 2) are in neighboring columns and overlap >=3 rows, fill away from the longer/shorter one in the overlap at offsets [0,1,ol_len//2] with s1/s2/s3 (reversed for type 2), direction based on relative column position—subtlety: only if the current stem's length >= adjacent's; fills stop at non-blanks.
 * Isolated stems: For type 1, fill at offsets [1,3,5] with s1/s2/s3 horizontally both directions; for type 2, offsets [0, length//2, length-2] with s3/s2/s1—subtlety: for type 2 at offset 0, additional downward fills in the next row based on horizontal reach (e.g., if right side reaches a filled cell, fill below the blanks to that point, and mirror opposites).
 * Order matters: Top/bottom/middle first, then stems (stems may use prior fills); no overwrites unless matching; grid is mutable copy.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns don't wrap edges; fills are row-by-row until break on mismatch; isolated type 2 has complex "reached" logic for next-row mirroring (e.g., fill below reached segments and set opposites); adjacent fills are only in overlap and away direction; potential for stems to be created by prior fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns as-is; singletons not at edges skip top/bottom; short overlaps (<3) skip adjacent processing; offsets may exceed length, so unique/sorted handling; type 2 offset 0 special fill checks existing fills in current row to determine next-row propagation.
 * General: Colors seem thematic (1/2 stems, 3-7 fills, 9 sometimes appears but not in singletons here); no diagonal or other interactions; all fills are horizontal or vertical-aligned to anchors.

 * Top/bottom pattern processing works partially: in train1, it fills some downward/upward triplets (e.g., generated has 2,3 in row3 col18-19 matching expected, and 2,4 in row6), but fails on specifics like row2 col17-19 (generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3? wait, minor; actually row3 generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3, but row2 generated 2,4 vs expected 2,4—discrepancy in presentation but seems partial match; however, overfills or misses in lower sections).
 * Middle extensions work for horizontal fills from non-edge singletons, but in train1, it doesn't appear to trigger much (e.g., singleton 1 at row10 col2 extends? but generated doesn't show full horizontals).
 * Stem finding is helpful and detects long vertical 1/2 runs, but processing fails: in train1, isolated stems like bottom 1-stem and 2-stem get partial horizontal fills (e.g., row16-17 has 4,3,3,3,3,4 and 2,2,2,2,2,2,4 matching expected), but type2 offset0 special downward mirroring is broken (e.g., row18 has 8,1,5 vs expected 8,1,5—minor, but later rows like row20 has 4,2,6,6,6,6,6 vs expected 4,2,6,6,6,6,6; actually mismatches in row21: generated 4,2,6 vs expected 3,2,8—wrong color s1=1 vs s3=3?); adjacent stems not handled well (train1 has no clear adjacents, but overfills elsewhere).
 * In train2, singletons (1,3,6?) processed poorly: top/bottom patterns miss (e.g., generated fills 1,2 vertical but expected has more 3/6 extensions); stems like left 3/6/9 verticals get no fills, while right 1/2/4 get partial but wrong (row11 generated 2,1,3,3,3,... vs expected 4,1,3,3,3—wrong starting color); isolated stem logic applies incorrectly, leading to extra 1/2 fills in empty areas.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure (singletons + stems) but bugs in pattern offsets (e.g., bottom pat_cols for s3 wrong?), adjacent overlap calc (skips valid?), and type2 special fill (reach detection flawed, e.g., temp_j unused, mirroring opposites incorrectly sets non-singleton colors); no handling for post-fill stem recreation (runs after all processes?); unhelpful: process_stems has redundant direction code for adjacent (if step==-1 repeated); the whole adjacent block skips if length < other_len but doesn't swap perspective.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills and mismatches expected patterns based on mental simulation of rules.
 * Singletons likely 1,2,4 (appear once: 1 at row0 col4-5? wait input has two 1s? wait, input row0 has two 1s, but counts would see multiples—program returns early if !=3 singletons, but generated fills anyway? Bug: perhaps counts wrong or fills ignore check.
 * Top patterns should seed from potential top singleton (e.g., if 1 at row0 col4, but duplicates; mental: no clear top singleton, so minimal top fills; generated has row1 4,1 but input already has, then row2 4,2,9...—seems partial match but adds 9s wrongly.
 * Stems: Clear type2 stem at col5 rows0-6 (1? wait input has 1,1 at row0 col4-5, but 2 at row2-4 col5? Mixed; long 7-stem? No, stems only 1/2; generated ignores, fills unrelated 9/7 elsewhere (e.g., row2 has 9s extended wrongly from input 9s).
 * Bottom/middle: Input has bottom-ish 6/7/9, but generated adds 1,4 at row15-16 wrongly; horizontal extensions from 2/4 at row14-15 partial but adds extra 7s.
 * Adjacent stems missing: Potential col4 (3s short) and col5 (2s) not adjacent properly; generated row25-28 has 4,2,9/7 but expected likely mirrors from type2 offset0 (downward from row4 col5 2, but input sparse).
 * Overall, fills like row12 9s extended left/right from input but shouldn't (not singleton/stem triggered); test has more colors (7,9) not in singletons, so rules may need generalization beyond s1/s2/s3 for fills—program assumes only s1-3 colors, leading to blanks remaining or wrong propagation; does not make sense as it creates inconsistent patterns (e.g., isolated 7-stem in row4 not processed as stem since !=1/2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly identified singletons (e.g., in train1, s1=1,s2=2,s3=3) and their positions, enabling basic pattern triggering.
 * Successfully filled some top/bottom 3-column propagations (e.g., train1 top with 2-3-4? but mismatched colors; bottom with 2-3-1 correctly in parts).
 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle similar to a nonogram or pattern-propagation challenge, where a partially filled grid (with numbers 1-9 as colors and 8 as blanks) must be completed by identifying three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each), detecting vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2), and applying specific filling rules like horizontal extensions, vertical propagations from top/bottom singletons, and isolated stem patterns to propagate colors logically without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors with count==1); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) of length >=4 in a column; type 1 stems (value=1) and type 2 (value=2) have opposite behaviors, with isolation checked against adjacent columns (c-1 or c+1) for opposite-type stems of equal or longer length that overlap vertically.
 * For isolated stems, fill horizontals at specific row offsets: type 1 uses offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; type 2 uses [0,3,length-2] with [s3,s2,s1]; extend left/right from the stem column until non-blank or edge.
 * Subtlety for type 1 stems: Check for a left-prefix (adjacent left column with >=2 consistent non-stem/non-blank cells); if present, fill an extra row (offset=2) rightward with s1 and set the left cell to the prefix color if it's blank/stem.
 * Top-row singletons (r==0) trigger diagonal-ish patterns: depending on which singleton (s1/s2/s3), select column offsets like [-4,-2,0] for s1, and propagate downward only if all pattern columns are blank or match the color in each row.
 * Bottom-row singletons (r==h-1) use asymmetric patterns: e.g., for s1 [0,1,4], propagate upward similarly, but offsets are irregular (e.g., negative for s3).
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right with their color until non-blank.
 * Propagation stops if a row can't be fully matched (any pattern column out-of-bounds or non-matching non-blank).
 * Subtle: Stem processing happens before singleton patterns, so it can pre-fill areas that affect later propagations; avoid overfilling by checking for 8 only.
 * Grids can be tall/narrow (e.g., 21x27 or 29 cols in test); ensure bounds checks (0 <= j < w).
 * No diagonal or complex interactions beyond stems/singletons; unfilled areas remain 8.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for top/bottom are color-ordered differently (top: [s3,s2,s1], bottom: [s1,s2,s3]); isolation requires no vertical overlap with qualifying opposite stems.

(Note: Similar propagate_bottom_pattern exists but propagates upward; process_stem_fills handles isolated stem horizontal fills with offsets and left-prefix logic; extend_middle_horizontal does simple left/right extension. These are all helpful for core logic but may need tweaks for overfilling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly handled Training example 1 by properly identifying singletons (e.g., assuming 3,6,9), stems, and propagations to fill the full expected grid without errors.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output overfilled horizontals in the bottom section—e.g., row 10 (0-indexed) has 4,1 followed by nine 3's extending right to col26, but expected has only 4,1 and blanks after (no 3's); row 11 has 4,1,3's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks; row 12 has 2,1, six 6's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks before six 6's? Wait, parsing shows generated extended 3's and misplaced 2's/4's in rows 10-18, likely due to incorrect stem isolation or offset filling in process_stem_fills allowing overlaps or wrong colors (e.g., s1=3? assuming singletons 1,3,6 or similar, but code sorted s1<s2<s3 and applied [s1,s2,s3] wrongly).
 * Stem processing pre-fills interfered with singleton patterns, causing extra fills in non-isolated areas (e.g., generated row 2 has extra 1's and 4's not in expected? No, row 2 matches, but bottom mismatches suggest non-isolated stems were processed anyway).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially (e.g., top fills like row0-1 3's and row3 6's match), but middle/bottom horizontals overextended (e.g., generated row14 has nine 9's, expected matches, but adjacent rows don't).
 * Function is_isolated seems correct but may miss subtle overlaps; process_stem_fills' left-prefix logic might trigger falsely, filling extras (unknown why in this case).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but propagate functions could be stricter on "can_fill" to prevent partial matches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It identifies singletons (likely 1,3,9 or similar, given fills) and applies some stem fills (e.g., row4-5 wide 6's and 7's from a type2 stem?), top/bottom patterns (e.g., row1-2 9's and 3's propagating down, row25-28 9's/6's/7's from bottom), and horizontals (e.g., row11 wide 9's), but overfills inconsistently—e.g., row2 has 9's then 3's/2's/1's clumped awkwardly without clear pattern match, row16 has 1,4 but no further propagation upward despite bottom rules; row7-10 are mostly blank but should propagate from nearby stems/singletons (e.g., col4 has 3's in row6 but no extension); row23-24 have isolated 1's/4's/2's without horizontal extension, suggesting missed middle singleton rule or bounds issues in wider 29-col grid; overall, it fills ~60% logically but leaves gaps (e.g., row6 3's not extended) and adds extras (e.g., row12 wide 9's may overstep isolation), so rules like stem offsets or pattern cols need adjustment for asymmetric grids.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-10-01 00:07:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill blank cells (8s) with colors (1-9) based on patterns seeded by exactly three singleton colors (appearing once each), which propagate horizontally and vertically, while interacting with vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s at least 4 cells long) to extend fills in specific directions and offsets. The puzzle relies on relative positioning of singletons and stems, with rules for top/bottom/middle placements, stem types (1 vs. 2), pairing checks to avoid overfilling, and conditional propagation based on adjacent filled cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (sorted as s1 < s2 < s3) must exist; if not, no filling occurs—easy to miss edge cases where counts change mid-process due to prior fills.
 * Top patterns (if singleton in row 0) use every-other-column spacing (e.g., c, c+2, c+4 for s1 at c) with colors [s1,s2,s3] or reversed variants, propagating downward only if compatible (blanks or matching colors).
 * Bottom patterns (if singleton in last row) use irregular spacing (e.g., c, c+1, c+3 for s1) with colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward with similar compatibility checks—subtle asymmetry in column offsets vs. top.
 * Middle singletons (not edges) extend horizontally left/right through contiguous blanks with the singleton's color, but only in that row—no vertical propagation here.
 * Stems are vertical runs of uniform 1 or 2 (type=cl) >=4 long; process after singletons to avoid interference.
 * Type 1 stems (color 1): Fill unpaired sides (left/right if no adjacent type 2 stem overlaps in rows) at offsets 1,3,5 from start with s1,s2,s3 horizontally—subtle: offsets must be < length, and "paired" checks row overlap strictly (max(start) < min(end)).
 * Type 2 stems (color 2): Only if isolated (no adjacent type 1 overlapping); for each side, count contiguous horizontal blanks at offset 0, check if ends with s3; fill offset 0 with s3 up to that count, s2 at offsets [3] or [3, length-2] if ends with s3, s1 at (length-1) or (length-2)—easy to miss: fills are horizontal from stem column, and s2 has conditional extra offset based on s3 adjacency.
 * Propagation stops if incompatible (out of bounds or mismatch); all fills overwrite only 8s, preserve existing colors.
 * Order matters: Singletons first (top/bottom/middle), then stems—mid-process fills can create new stems or change counts, but code copies grid and counts initial non-blanks only.
 * Subtle: Patterns assume sorted singletons, but placement depends on which singleton (sk) is at the position; column checks prevent out-of-bounds.
 * No diagonal or other interactions; colors beyond singletons (e.g., multiples of 3-7,9) are treated as fixed clues.
 * Potential overfill risk: Stem fills might overlap singleton propagations, but compatibility checks mitigate.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly identifies singletons and processes top/bottom/middle patterns, as seen in train2 succeeding fully.
 * For train1 (incorrect): Generated output filled left-side stems and some right-side horizontals (e.g., rows 0-6 match expected with 1,5,6 patterns), but failed to fill vertical propagations on the right (e.g., rows 10-15 have many 8s where expected has vertical 1,5,6 repeating; row 17 has 8,1,5,8,8,6 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6—wait, similar but row 18 has 8,1,5,8,6,1,1,1 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6 with later fills; row 23 has 8,1,5,8,8,6,8,1,5 vs. expected with 5s; row 24 has 1s at end vs. expected 1s but positioned differently)—likely due to type2 stem processing not triggering extra s2 offsets or s1 placement correctly, leaving blanks; also, row 22 has 3,2,5,5,5,5,5 vs. expected 3,2,1,1,1,1,1 (mismatch in vertical fill at bottom-right).
 * Train1 also overfilled or mismatched in bottom-right (e.g., row 20: 3,2,8s vs. expected 3,2,8s—matches, but propagation stopped early); unknown why vertical singleton patterns (e.g., from row9 col2=1) didn't propagate fully downward like in expected.
 * Stem processing order/issues: Type1 fills happened, but type2 isolation check or condition for extra s2_off (based on s3 adjacency) failed, preventing full right-side fills; paired check for type1 might have wrongly skipped a side.
 * Middle horizontal extension worked partially (e.g., row8 2s extended), but didn't interact well with stems.
 * Function `get_top_pattern` and `get_bottom_pattern` are helpful but subtle—bottom has non-symmetric offsets (c+1,c+3 vs. top's even spacing), which may cause misalignment in irregular grids.
 * Function `process_type1_stem` is mostly correct but misses if stem length <5 (skips s3), which happened in train1 (length=6? but offsets up to5).
 * Function `process_type2_stem` is broken/incomplete: Fills s3 at offset0 correctly in some cases, but s2_offs logic ( [3] or [3,length-2] if condition) and s1_off (length-1 or -2) didn't trigger extra fills in train1 right-side, leaving verticals blank; also, fills s3 horizontally but code has fill_stem_direction which is horizontal—wait, it's correct but condition= s3 at next_cc may not detect properly if s3 is from prior fill.
 * `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and worked (e.g., singleton 4 in row7 extended), but limited to single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands singleton seeding and basic propagation but underfills complex stem interactions, especially type2 conditionals and vertical chaining.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identified singletons (likely 1,2,3 or similar, but grid has 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 visible), filled top-left patterns (e.g., row0-1 has 1s at col4-5, row2 has 2,9s), vertical stems (e.g., row4-5 full 6s and 7s), bottom patterns (row11 full 9s with 2,4,7), and some middle extensions (row12-15 2,4 with verticals); right-side has partial 6,7,9 in rows17-28, suggesting type1/2 stem processing from col21-22.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Many 8s remain (e.g., rows6-10 almost empty except col4-5 3s; row16 has 1,4 but no extension; rows17-28 have sparse 6,7,9 at col21-22 but no horizontal fills from stems or singleton propagation—e.g., no s1/s2/s3 offsets visible); left-bottom (row28 col9-10 3s) seems isolated without propagation; unknown singletons but assuming 1,2,3, top singleton at row0 col4=1 should propagate [1,?,?] down col4,5,? but row2 col5=2, row3 col5=1 mismatch? Wait, perhaps s1=1,s2=2,s3=3, but bottom row11 has 2,4,7 which doesn't match pattern; likely type2 stem at col5 (2s in row2-5?) didn't fill horizontals properly to right (e.g., no 3,4 extensions beyond); right-side verticals (6,7,9) seem like fixed clues, not propagated from singletons—output underfills connections between left stems and right blanks.
 * Test output misses full propagation: E.g., if singleton 1 at row15 col24, middle horizontal should fill row15 blanks around col24 with 1s, but it's 1,4—no extension left/right; bottom singleton? (none obvious) didn't trigger upward fills; stem at col4 (4,2,6,7,3?) isn't uniform 1/2, so no processing, leaving gaps.
 * To handle test: Need better stem detection post-all fills (code does single pass), recount singletons after initial propagations, and fix type2 condition to detect s3 from clues (not just blanks).

[2025-10-01 00:07:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in blank cells (represented by 8) based on patterns derived from three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each) and vertical "stem" structures (long runs of specific values like 1 or 2). The filling rules involve propagating patterns from top/bottom singletons, horizontal extensions in middles, and interactions between adjacent stems, while preserving existing non-blank cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count 1, excluding 8); if not, return the grid unchanged—subtlety: counts only non-8 cells, and singletons are sorted as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singleton) propagate downward in diagonal-ish column offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c-4, c-2, c with colors s3,s2,s1), but only if all three columns are blank in a row; must check bounds and stop if a row can't be fully blank-matched.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singleton) propagate upward with different offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c, c+1, c+4 with colors s1,s2,s3), but only fill if the target row's three columns are entirely blank; direction reverses from top.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) extend horizontally left/right by filling contiguous blanks in the same row with the singleton's color.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 identical cells of 1 or 2; pair adjacent stems of opposite types (1 and 2) if overlapping in rows and neighboring columns, then fill horizontal extensions at specific row offsets (e.g., 0,2,4 for type 1 rightward) with singleton colors in order (s1,s2,s3 or reverse).
 * Isolated stems fill horizontal blanks left/right at offsets, but without direction preference; cap extensions for type 2 stems fill left if above matches and left is blank.
 * Subtlety: Stem filling computes left/right blank lengths but only fills in the "direction" if paired, otherwise opportunistically left or right; offsets vary by type and pairing (e.g., [0,3,length-2] for unpaired type 2).
 * After all processes, re-find stems for cap extensions, as prior fills might create new ones.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns stop propagating if a row has partial matches (must be all blank or all matching); bounds checking prevents out-of-grid access; stems ignore 8s and other values, only count consecutive 1s/2s.
 * Overall: Preserve non-8 cells; output is a deep copy of input with only 8s potentially filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts
```
(This correctly counts non-blank occurrences per color, essential for identifying singletons.)

```python
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```
(This maps singletons to their (row, col) positions, crucial for pattern starting points.)

```python
def find_stems(g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    runs = []
    for col in range(w):
        i = 0
        while i < h:
            val = g[i][col]
            if val == 1 or val == 2:
                cl = val
                start_i = i
                i += 1
                while i < h and g[i][col] == cl:
                    i += 1
                length = i - start_i
                if length >= 4:
                    runs.append((start_i, i, col, cl))
            else:
                i += 1
    return runs
```
(This extracts vertical stem runs of 1/2 >=4 long as (start_row, end_row, col, type), useful for pairing and offset-based filling; re-call after other fills as stems can emerge.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a structured approach: identifies singletons, propagates top/bottom/middle patterns, handles stems with pairing and offsets, and adds cap extensions—shows good high-level understanding of rules like singleton sorting, pattern offsets, and stem interactions.
 * What worked: Core logic for counting singletons, finding positions, and basic stem detection is sound; middle horizontal extension and top/bottom propagation skeletons are mostly correct in intent (e.g., checking blanks before filling, stopping on mismatches).
 * What didn't work: Complete failure due to execution error ("name 'g' is not defined") in get_pat_cols, caused by referencing len(g[0]) without g in scope—blocks all runs; bottom pattern filling has flawed propagation (fills upward but checks blanks incorrectly, potentially overfills); stem filling logic is incomplete/buggy (e.g., offsets for paired stems use hardcoded [0,2,4] etc. but don't always align with colors; isolated fills don't prioritize direction well; right/left length computation is done but filling loops have off-by-one risks or don't use lengths fully).
 * process_top_patterns partially works for downward propagation but skips if bounds invalid; process_bottom_patterns has wrong offsets/colors for bottom (e.g., for s1: [c, c+1, c+4] seems arbitrary, not matching top symmetry) and upward check uses all blanks but fills unconditionally in loop.
 * process_stems overcomplicates pairing (searches all stems but doesn't handle multiple pairs) and offset selection (e.g., for type 2 unpaired: [0,3,length-2] may exceed grid); filling only does one side even if both available.
 * process_cap_extensions is a good idea but only handles left for type 2 and assumes sr>0 without full checks.
 * process_middle is simple and likely correct for horizontal blanks.
 * Overall, no successful runs, so can't verify filling accuracy; unhelpful/broken: get_pat_cols (scoping error, plus asymmetric offsets for top/bottom that may not match puzzle intent); process_bottom_patterns (logic flaws in propagation direction/checks).

**Test output:**
 * All attempts (training 1, training 2, test) resulted in ERROR - Execution error: name 'g' is not defined, due to the scoping issue in get_pat_cols—nothing was generated, so outputs do not make sense or match expected filled grids.
 * Since no actual grid output was produced, can't compare to correct solution, but this error prevents any validation; expected test output should be a filled grid with patterns from singletons/stems, but instead it's unusable—likely the test has singletons and stems that would propagate fills, but code crash hides this.
 * The error is consistent across examples, indicating a fundamental code structure flaw rather than input-specific; fixing scope would allow checking if fills match (e.g., test probably expects specific diagonal-ish fills from top/bottom and horizontal from stems, but current offsets/colors may still mismatch subtly).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

# Existing count function is helpful for identifying singletons pre- and post-fill
def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

# Helpful for finding singleton positions after stem processing
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> dict:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (similar to a logic or pattern-completion puzzle like Fillomino or a variant of nonogram with color rules) where a partial grid with numbers representing colors (1,2,3,4,6,7,9) and blanks (8) must be completed by propagating fills based on detected patterns from unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (runs of 1 or 2 of length >=4). The goal is to fill blanks horizontally and vertically according to specific offset-based rules triggered by isolated stems and singleton positions at the top, bottom, or middle of the grid, ensuring no overfills or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors appearing once each); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent mapping (e.g., s1=1, s2=3, s3=6 in training example 2).
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) in a column, length >=4; only "isolated" stems (no overlapping adjacent stems of the opposite type in neighboring columns) trigger horizontal fills at specific row offsets: for type 1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for type 2, offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1] (where l=stem length)—fills propagate left/right until non-blank or edge.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singletons): Trigger a 3-column pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c>=4: cols [c-4,c-3,c] with [s3,s2,s1]) and propagate downward while rows are all blank in those columns; partial fill starts at row 0.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singletons): Similar but mirrored (e.g., for s1 at c: [c,c+1,c+4] with [s1,s2,s3]), propagate upward; partial fill at bottom row; anchors adjust for s2/s3 positions to fit left/right constraints.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom): Extend horizontally left/right from the singleton's position until non-blank or edge, but only in that row—no vertical propagation.
 * Order matters: Process stems first (as they may create or block patterns), then top patterns, bottom patterns, then middle extensions; avoid filling over existing non-blanks.
 * Subtleties: Patterns may not fill full height if blocked; stems must be exactly isolated (no vertical overlap with opposite-type adjacent stems); offsets can exceed grid height (skip invalid rows); colors like 4,6,7,9 may be pre-filled and influence isolation/blocking; horizontal fills stop at edges or non-8; singletons can be pre-filled in stems or patterns.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; singletons not in expected positions (e.g., too left for anchors) skip pattern placement; multiple singletons may trigger overlapping fills, but propagation checks for all-blank rows prevent conflicts.
 * Potential misses: Not handling partial vertical propagation correctly (e.g., stopping when a pattern row has a non-8); incorrect offset calculations for stems (e.g., l-2 may be invalid); assuming all singletons trigger patterns when only top/bottom do; not sorting singletons leading to color mismatches; stems of length exactly 4 may have offset l-2=2, which could overlap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely simple top/bottom or stem case).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated incorrect horizontal fills from stems (e.g., row 3 left side unfilled as 8's, but expected 6's across cols 0-4; row 1 has 3's instead of expected 3's only partially? Wait, row 1 matches, but row 3 mismatch suggests wrong offset/color for a type-2 stem or isolation failure).
 * In training 2 generated vs expected: Lower section (rows ~10-17, cols ~16-18) shows repeated vertical 2/1/4 but no horizontal extensions or patterned fills (e.g., expected row 11 cols 18-26=3's, row 12=6's, row 14=9's from a bottom or middle pattern, but generated leaves them 8's—likely because place_bottom_pattern or extend_middle didn't trigger due to singleton positions not at exact bottom or incorrect anchor checks; also row 3 cols 0-4=8's vs expected 6's, indicating stem processing skipped or miscolored an isolated stem).
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected some verticals like col 16 1's and col 17 2's/4's), but isolation check or offset application failed for left-side stems.
 * Top/bottom pattern placement worked for upper parts (e.g., row 0/1 partial matches, row 5 9's match), but propagation stopped prematurely or didn't apply to lower singletons.
 * Middle extensions applied minimally (e.g., no horizontals from lower 1/2/4), suggesting pos_dict didn't capture them as middle or extend_middle only hit non-8 blocks immediately.
 * No overfills observed, but underfills dominate failures; count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions seem correct (identified singletons properly).
 * find_stems is helpful but may miss non-1/2 stems or short runs; is_isolated is essential but potentially too strict (e.g., if adjacent stems don't overlap vertically, it should pass—bug if it falsely rejects).
 * fill_horizontal is useful for propagation but doesn't handle vertical checks.
 * place_top_pattern and place_bottom_pattern are partially correct (anchor logic for s1/s2/s3 positions) but fail on propagation (e.g., checks all-blank but may not partial-fill correctly if singleton not blank).
 * extend_middle is broken/incomplete: Only horizontal from middle singletons, but expected shows vertical-like patterns (e.g., staggered horizontals at offsets), suggesting it needs to treat middle as mini-stems or patterns.
 * process_stems orders offsets/colors correctly for types but skips if offsets out-of-bounds; however, in training 2, it filled row 3 cols 14-22 as 4/2's correctly but missed left 6's—likely a separate stem not isolated.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct overall; it shows partial pattern fills (e.g., row 1: 9's in cols 4-7? Wait, row 0 has 1's at cols 4-5; row 1 9's cols 0-3 and 4=4? Inconsistent with singleton rules—singletons seem to be 1,3,4? But fills like row 2 9's cols 6-15 and 3's/2's/1's suggest top-pattern propagation from a row0 singleton, but colors mismatch expected s1/s2/s3 mapping).
 * Upper section: Row 4 full 6's cols 6-28 looks like a horizontal from stem offset, but row 5 full 7's suggests another, yet no vertical stems visible in input (test input not provided, but output implies over-propagation or wrong colors—7's may be pre-filled, but filling over?).
 * Lower section: Row 11 full 9's cols 0-23 then 2/4/7's staggered; row 12 6's cols 0-23 then 2/4; row 13 7's cols 0-23 then 2/4— this looks like bottom-pattern propagation upward, but staggered ends (e.g., 7's in row 12 col 28?) and row 24-28 mirroring upper suggest symmetric but incorrect color assignments (e.g., why 9's then 6's then 7's? Likely wrong s1/s2/s3 or offset misapplication; expected might stagger based on multiple singletons, but output fills too uniformly leftward).
 * Middle empties (rows 7-10, 16-23 all 8's) indicate missed middle extensions or no detected middle singletons (e.g., row 6 has 3's cols 4-5, but no horizontal spread).
 * No obvious overfills, but underfills in potential stem areas (e.g., col 4 has vertical 4/2/6/7/3/8..., suggesting a stem of mixed types not processed); output doesn't match puzzle logic as fills seem to ignore isolation (e.g., adjacent columns filled similarly without check).
 * Test has wider grid (29 cols?) with more pre-fills (e.g., row 2 has 9's and 3/2/1 clusters), implying complex interactions—output partially captures vertical propagation (e.g., row 4-5 horizontals) but fails on horizontal offsets from lower singletons (e.g., row 24 has 1's/4/2/9's but no full lines).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for simple top/bottom but not for intertwined stems/singletons—likely inherits training 2 bugs (e.g., no patterned horizontals in lower right).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (value 8) are populated with colors (integers 1-9) based on rules involving three unique singletons (colors appearing exactly once), horizontal extensions from them, and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2) that trigger patterned fills either in isolation or when adjacent. The goal is to propagate fills downward/upward or sideways from these elements while respecting existing colors and avoiding overwrites unless matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) must exist initially; if not, no fills occur—subtlety: counts exclude blanks (8), and singletons are sorted.
 * Top patterns: If a singleton is at row 0, it seeds a repeating horizontal triplet pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c: fills s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c, downward until mismatch), but only if columns are valid and cells are blank or match; patterns shift based on which singleton (s1/s2/s3) is the anchor.
 * Bottom patterns: Similar to top but upward from row h-1, with different column offsets (e.g., for s1 at bottom: s1 at c, s2 at c+1, s3 at c+4) and reversed direction.
 * Middle extensions: For non-edge singletons, fill horizontal runs of blanks left/right from the singleton's position with its color—subtlety: this is simple flood-fill but stops at non-blanks.
 * Stems: Vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s (type=1 or 2); processed after other steps, so stems can form dynamically.
 * Adjacent stems: If two stems of opposite types (1 and 2) are in neighboring columns and overlap >=3 rows, fill away from the longer/shorter one in the overlap at offsets [0,1,ol_len//2] with s1/s2/s3 (reversed for type 2), direction based on relative column position—subtlety: only if the current stem's length >= adjacent's; fills stop at non-blanks.
 * Isolated stems: For type 1, fill at offsets [1,3,5] with s1/s2/s3 horizontally both directions; for type 2, offsets [0, length//2, length-2] with s3/s2/s1—subtlety: for type 2 at offset 0, additional downward fills in the next row based on horizontal reach (e.g., if right side reaches a filled cell, fill below the blanks to that point, and mirror opposites).
 * Order matters: Top/bottom/middle first, then stems (stems may use prior fills); no overwrites unless matching; grid is mutable copy.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns don't wrap edges; fills are row-by-row until break on mismatch; isolated type 2 has complex "reached" logic for next-row mirroring (e.g., fill below reached segments and set opposites); adjacent fills are only in overlap and away direction; potential for stems to be created by prior fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns as-is; singletons not at edges skip top/bottom; short overlaps (<3) skip adjacent processing; offsets may exceed length, so unique/sorted handling; type 2 offset 0 special fill checks existing fills in current row to determine next-row propagation.
 * General: Colors seem thematic (1/2 stems, 3-7 fills, 9 sometimes appears but not in singletons here); no diagonal or other interactions; all fills are horizontal or vertical-aligned to anchors.

 * Top/bottom pattern processing works partially: in train1, it fills some downward/upward triplets (e.g., generated has 2,3 in row3 col18-19 matching expected, and 2,4 in row6), but fails on specifics like row2 col17-19 (generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3? wait, minor; actually row3 generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3, but row2 generated 2,4 vs expected 2,4—discrepancy in presentation but seems partial match; however, overfills or misses in lower sections).
 * Middle extensions work for horizontal fills from non-edge singletons, but in train1, it doesn't appear to trigger much (e.g., singleton 1 at row10 col2 extends? but generated doesn't show full horizontals).
 * Stem finding is helpful and detects long vertical 1/2 runs, but processing fails: in train1, isolated stems like bottom 1-stem and 2-stem get partial horizontal fills (e.g., row16-17 has 4,3,3,3,3,4 and 2,2,2,2,2,2,4 matching expected), but type2 offset0 special downward mirroring is broken (e.g., row18 has 8,1,5 vs expected 8,1,5—minor, but later rows like row20 has 4,2,6,6,6,6,6 vs expected 4,2,6,6,6,6,6; actually mismatches in row21: generated 4,2,6 vs expected 3,2,8—wrong color s1=1 vs s3=3?); adjacent stems not handled well (train1 has no clear adjacents, but overfills elsewhere).
 * In train2, singletons (1,3,6?) processed poorly: top/bottom patterns miss (e.g., generated fills 1,2 vertical but expected has more 3/6 extensions); stems like left 3/6/9 verticals get no fills, while right 1/2/4 get partial but wrong (row11 generated 2,1,3,3,3,... vs expected 4,1,3,3,3—wrong starting color); isolated stem logic applies incorrectly, leading to extra 1/2 fills in empty areas.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure (singletons + stems) but bugs in pattern offsets (e.g., bottom pat_cols for s3 wrong?), adjacent overlap calc (skips valid?), and type2 special fill (reach detection flawed, e.g., temp_j unused, mirroring opposites incorrectly sets non-singleton colors); no handling for post-fill stem recreation (runs after all processes?); unhelpful: process_stems has redundant direction code for adjacent (if step==-1 repeated); the whole adjacent block skips if length < other_len but doesn't swap perspective.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills and mismatches expected patterns based on mental simulation of rules.
 * Singletons likely 1,2,4 (appear once: 1 at row0 col4-5? wait input has two 1s? wait, input row0 has two 1s, but counts would see multiples—program returns early if !=3 singletons, but generated fills anyway? Bug: perhaps counts wrong or fills ignore check.
 * Top patterns should seed from potential top singleton (e.g., if 1 at row0 col4, but duplicates; mental: no clear top singleton, so minimal top fills; generated has row1 4,1 but input already has, then row2 4,2,9...—seems partial match but adds 9s wrongly.
 * Stems: Clear type2 stem at col5 rows0-6 (1? wait input has 1,1 at row0 col4-5, but 2 at row2-4 col5? Mixed; long 7-stem? No, stems only 1/2; generated ignores, fills unrelated 9/7 elsewhere (e.g., row2 has 9s extended wrongly from input 9s).
 * Bottom/middle: Input has bottom-ish 6/7/9, but generated adds 1,4 at row15-16 wrongly; horizontal extensions from 2/4 at row14-15 partial but adds extra 7s.
 * Adjacent stems missing: Potential col4 (3s short) and col5 (2s) not adjacent properly; generated row25-28 has 4,2,9/7 but expected likely mirrors from type2 offset0 (downward from row4 col5 2, but input sparse).
 * Overall, fills like row12 9s extended left/right from input but shouldn't (not singleton/stem triggered); test has more colors (7,9) not in singletons, so rules may need generalization beyond s1/s2/s3 for fills—program assumes only s1-3 colors, leading to blanks remaining or wrong propagation; does not make sense as it creates inconsistent patterns (e.g., isolated 7-stem in row4 not processed as stem since !=1/2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly identified singletons (e.g., in train1, s1=1,s2=2,s3=3) and their positions, enabling basic pattern triggering.
 * Successfully filled some top/bottom 3-column propagations (e.g., train1 top with 2-3-4? but mismatched colors; bottom with 2-3-1 correctly in parts).
 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle similar to a nonogram or pattern-propagation challenge, where a partially filled grid (with numbers 1-9 as colors and 8 as blanks) must be completed by identifying three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each), detecting vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2), and applying specific filling rules like horizontal extensions, vertical propagations from top/bottom singletons, and isolated stem patterns to propagate colors logically without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors with count==1); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) of length >=4 in a column; type 1 stems (value=1) and type 2 (value=2) have opposite behaviors, with isolation checked against adjacent columns (c-1 or c+1) for opposite-type stems of equal or longer length that overlap vertically.
 * For isolated stems, fill horizontals at specific row offsets: type 1 uses offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; type 2 uses [0,3,length-2] with [s3,s2,s1]; extend left/right from the stem column until non-blank or edge.
 * Subtlety for type 1 stems: Check for a left-prefix (adjacent left column with >=2 consistent non-stem/non-blank cells); if present, fill an extra row (offset=2) rightward with s1 and set the left cell to the prefix color if it's blank/stem.
 * Top-row singletons (r==0) trigger diagonal-ish patterns: depending on which singleton (s1/s2/s3), select column offsets like [-4,-2,0] for s1, and propagate downward only if all pattern columns are blank or match the color in each row.
 * Bottom-row singletons (r==h-1) use asymmetric patterns: e.g., for s1 [0,1,4], propagate upward similarly, but offsets are irregular (e.g., negative for s3).
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right with their color until non-blank.
 * Propagation stops if a row can't be fully matched (any pattern column out-of-bounds or non-matching non-blank).
 * Subtle: Stem processing happens before singleton patterns, so it can pre-fill areas that affect later propagations; avoid overfilling by checking for 8 only.
 * Grids can be tall/narrow (e.g., 21x27 or 29 cols in test); ensure bounds checks (0 <= j < w).
 * No diagonal or complex interactions beyond stems/singletons; unfilled areas remain 8.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for top/bottom are color-ordered differently (top: [s3,s2,s1], bottom: [s1,s2,s3]); isolation requires no vertical overlap with qualifying opposite stems.

```
(Note: Similar propagate_bottom_pattern exists but propagates upward; process_stem_fills handles isolated stem horizontal fills with offsets and left-prefix logic; extend_middle_horizontal does simple left/right extension. These are all helpful for core logic but may need tweaks for overfilling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly handled Training example 1 by properly identifying singletons (e.g., assuming 3,6,9), stems, and propagations to fill the full expected grid without errors.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output overfilled horizontals in the bottom section—e.g., row 10 (0-indexed) has 4,1 followed by nine 3's extending right to col26, but expected has only 4,1 and blanks after (no 3's); row 11 has 4,1,3's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks; row 12 has 2,1, six 6's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks before six 6's? Wait, parsing shows generated extended 3's and misplaced 2's/4's in rows 10-18, likely due to incorrect stem isolation or offset filling in process_stem_fills allowing overlaps or wrong colors (e.g., s1=3? assuming singletons 1,3,6 or similar, but code sorted s1<s2<s3 and applied [s1,s2,s3] wrongly).
 * Stem processing pre-fills interfered with singleton patterns, causing extra fills in non-isolated areas (e.g., generated row 2 has extra 1's and 4's not in expected? No, row 2 matches, but bottom mismatches suggest non-isolated stems were processed anyway).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially (e.g., top fills like row0-1 3's and row3 6's match), but middle/bottom horizontals overextended (e.g., generated row14 has nine 9's, expected matches, but adjacent rows don't).
 * Function is_isolated seems correct but may miss subtle overlaps; process_stem_fills' left-prefix logic might trigger falsely, filling extras (unknown why in this case).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but propagate functions could be stricter on "can_fill" to prevent partial matches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It identifies singletons (likely 1,3,9 or similar, given fills) and applies some stem fills (e.g., row4-5 wide 6's and 7's from a type2 stem?), top/bottom patterns (e.g., row1-2 9's and 3's propagating down, row25-28 9's/6's/7's from bottom), and horizontals (e.g., row11 wide 9's), but overfills inconsistently—e.g., row2 has 9's then 3's/2's/1's clumped awkwardly without clear pattern match, row16 has 1,4 but no further propagation upward despite bottom rules; row7-10 are mostly blank but should propagate from nearby stems/singletons (e.g., col4 has 3's in row6 but no extension); row23-24 have isolated 1's/4's/2's without horizontal extension, suggesting missed middle singleton rule or bounds issues in wider 29-col grid; overall, it fills ~60% logically but leaves gaps (e.g., row6 3's not extended) and adds extras (e.g., row12 wide 9's may overstep isolation), so rules like stem offsets or pattern cols need adjustment for asymmetric grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill blank cells (8s) with colors (1-9) based on patterns seeded by exactly three singleton colors (appearing once each), which propagate horizontally and vertically, while interacting with vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s at least 4 cells long) to extend fills in specific directions and offsets. The puzzle relies on relative positioning of singletons and stems, with rules for top/bottom/middle placements, stem types (1 vs. 2), pairing checks to avoid overfilling, and conditional propagation based on adjacent filled cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (sorted as s1 < s2 < s3) must exist; if not, no filling occurs—easy to miss edge cases where counts change mid-process due to prior fills.
 * Top patterns (if singleton in row 0) use every-other-column spacing (e.g., c, c+2, c+4 for s1 at c) with colors [s1,s2,s3] or reversed variants, propagating downward only if compatible (blanks or matching colors).
 * Bottom patterns (if singleton in last row) use irregular spacing (e.g., c, c+1, c+3 for s1) with colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward with similar compatibility checks—subtle asymmetry in column offsets vs. top.
 * Middle singletons (not edges) extend horizontally left/right through contiguous blanks with the singleton's color, but only in that row—no vertical propagation here.
 * Stems are vertical runs of uniform 1 or 2 (type=cl) >=4 long; process after singletons to avoid interference.
 * Type 1 stems (color 1): Fill unpaired sides (left/right if no adjacent type 2 stem overlaps in rows) at offsets 1,3,5 from start with s1,s2,s3 horizontally—subtle: offsets must be < length, and "paired" checks row overlap strictly (max(start) < min(end)).
 * Type 2 stems (color 2): Only if isolated (no adjacent type 1 overlapping); for each side, count contiguous horizontal blanks at offset 0, check if ends with s3; fill offset 0 with s3 up to that count, s2 at offsets [3] or [3, length-2] if ends with s3, s1 at (length-1) or (length-2)—easy to miss: fills are horizontal from stem column, and s2 has conditional extra offset based on s3 adjacency.
 * Propagation stops if incompatible (out of bounds or mismatch); all fills overwrite only 8s, preserve existing colors.
 * Order matters: Singletons first (top/bottom/middle), then stems—mid-process fills can create new stems or change counts, but code copies grid and counts initial non-blanks only.
 * Subtle: Patterns assume sorted singletons, but placement depends on which singleton (sk) is at the position; column checks prevent out-of-bounds.
 * No diagonal or other interactions; colors beyond singletons (e.g., multiples of 3-7,9) are treated as fixed clues.
 * Potential overfill risk: Stem fills might overlap singleton propagations, but compatibility checks mitigate.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly identifies singletons and processes top/bottom/middle patterns, as seen in train2 succeeding fully.
 * For train1 (incorrect): Generated output filled left-side stems and some right-side horizontals (e.g., rows 0-6 match expected with 1,5,6 patterns), but failed to fill vertical propagations on the right (e.g., rows 10-15 have many 8s where expected has vertical 1,5,6 repeating; row 17 has 8,1,5,8,8,6 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6—wait, similar but row 18 has 8,1,5,8,6,1,1,1 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6 with later fills; row 23 has 8,1,5,8,8,6,8,1,5 vs. expected with 5s; row 24 has 1s at end vs. expected 1s but positioned differently)—likely due to type2 stem processing not triggering extra s2 offsets or s1 placement correctly, leaving blanks; also, row 22 has 3,2,5,5,5,5,5 vs. expected 3,2,1,1,1,1,1 (mismatch in vertical fill at bottom-right).
 * Train1 also overfilled or mismatched in bottom-right (e.g., row 20: 3,2,8s vs. expected 3,2,8s—matches, but propagation stopped early); unknown why vertical singleton patterns (e.g., from row9 col2=1) didn't propagate fully downward like in expected.
 * Stem processing order/issues: Type1 fills happened, but type2 isolation check or condition for extra s2_off (based on s3 adjacency) failed, preventing full right-side fills; paired check for type1 might have wrongly skipped a side.
 * Middle horizontal extension worked partially (e.g., row8 2s extended), but didn't interact well with stems.
 * Function `get_top_pattern` and `get_bottom_pattern` are helpful but subtle—bottom has non-symmetric offsets (c+1,c+3 vs. top's even spacing), which may cause misalignment in irregular grids.
 * Function `process_type1_stem` is mostly correct but misses if stem length <5 (skips s3), which happened in train1 (length=6? but offsets up to5).
 * Function `process_type2_stem` is broken/incomplete: Fills s3 at offset0 correctly in some cases, but s2_offs logic ( [3] or [3,length-2] if condition) and s1_off (length-1 or -2) didn't trigger extra fills in train1 right-side, leaving verticals blank; also, fills s3 horizontally but code has fill_stem_direction which is horizontal—wait, it's correct but condition= s3 at next_cc may not detect properly if s3 is from prior fill.
 * `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and worked (e.g., singleton 4 in row7 extended), but limited to single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands singleton seeding and basic propagation but underfills complex stem interactions, especially type2 conditionals and vertical chaining.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identified singletons (likely 1,2,3 or similar, but grid has 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 visible), filled top-left patterns (e.g., row0-1 has 1s at col4-5, row2 has 2,9s), vertical stems (e.g., row4-5 full 6s and 7s), bottom patterns (row11 full 9s with 2,4,7), and some middle extensions (row12-15 2,4 with verticals); right-side has partial 6,7,9 in rows17-28, suggesting type1/2 stem processing from col21-22.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Many 8s remain (e.g., rows6-10 almost empty except col4-5 3s; row16 has 1,4 but no extension; rows17-28 have sparse 6,7,9 at col21-22 but no horizontal fills from stems or singleton propagation—e.g., no s1/s2/s3 offsets visible); left-bottom (row28 col9-10 3s) seems isolated without propagation; unknown singletons but assuming 1,2,3, top singleton at row0 col4=1 should propagate [1,?,?] down col4,5,? but row2 col5=2, row3 col5=1 mismatch? Wait, perhaps s1=1,s2=2,s3=3, but bottom row11 has 2,4,7 which doesn't match pattern; likely type2 stem at col5 (2s in row2-5?) didn't fill horizontals properly to right (e.g., no 3,4 extensions beyond); right-side verticals (6,7,9) seem like fixed clues, not propagated from singletons—output underfills connections between left stems and right blanks.
 * Test output misses full propagation: E.g., if singleton 1 at row15 col24, middle horizontal should fill row15 blanks around col24 with 1s, but it's 1,4—no extension left/right; bottom singleton? (none obvious) didn't trigger upward fills; stem at col4 (4,2,6,7,3?) isn't uniform 1/2, so no processing, leaving gaps.
 * To handle test: Need better stem detection post-all fills (code does single pass), recount singletons after initial propagations, and fix type2 condition to detect s3 from clues (not just blanks).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:15:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-9) and blanks (8), where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules centered on three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each) and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2). The filling uses patterned horizontal extensions from stems and vertical propagations from singletons at edges, with the program attempting to automate this logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * There must be exactly 3 singleton colors (colors appearing once); if not, no filling occurs beyond copying the input—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Stems are vertical runs of the same value (1 or 2 only) of length >=4 in a column; type is the value (1 or 2), and they can be isolated (no adjacent overlapping stem of the opposite type in neighboring column) or paired (adjacent column has opposite type with row overlap).
 * For isolated stems: Fill horizontal blanks to left and right at specific row offsets from stem start (for type 1: offsets 1,3,5 with colors s1,s2,s3; for type 2: offsets 0,3,length-2 with s3,s2,s1); fill extends across consecutive blanks in the direction until non-blank.
 * For paired stems: Only fill on the "away" side (direction opposite the pair) using the same offsets/colors as isolated; if the longer stem determines processing, use its length for offsets.
 * Special rule in process_stem_side for type 2 at offset 0: If a horizontal run of blanks exists and the cell immediately after the run in the direction is s3, fill the row below the run span with s3 (but only if downward and within bounds).
 * Singleton positions: If at top row (row 0), apply top pattern (3-column offset based on which singleton k is: e.g., for k=s1, columns c-4/c-2/c with colors s3/s2/s1); propagate downward row-by-row if the 3 columns match the pattern colors or are blank, filling blanks.
 * If at bottom row (row h-1), apply bottom pattern (asymmetric offsets: e.g., for k=s1, columns c/c+1/c+4 with s1/s2/s3); propagate upward similarly.
 * If singleton in middle row, simply extend its color horizontally across all consecutive blanks in that row (left and right).
 * Propagation subtlety: Only continues while all 3 pattern columns per row are either blank or already match the required color; stops on mismatch; fills only blanks, doesn't overwrite existing colors.
 * Stem detection requires exact run matching (no interruptions); paired detection checks for opposite type, adjacent column (abs(col diff)=1), and row overlap (max(start) < min(end)).
 * Counts exclude blanks (8); existing colors in grid must not be overwritten—program copies input and only fills 8s.
 * Edge cases: Short stems (<4) ignored; patterns must fit within width (0 to w-1), else skipped; downward/upward propagation stops at bounds; for type 2 offsets, length-2 may exceed height, so check r < h.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping stems/pairs may cause double-filling attempts (but since only fill 8s, it's safe but could propagate wrong if not checked); singleton patterns assume sorted s1/s2/s3, so wrong sorting breaks colors; horizontal extensions in stems don't propagate vertically unless special_down triggers.

                result[r + 1][jj] = s3
```

(Note: process_isolated_stem and process_paired_stem orchestrate offsets/colors for sides; main program ties everything together by processing stems first, then singletons.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies singletons and stems, and handles propagation and horizontal extensions well, as evidenced by passing Training example 2 completely.
 * Failed Training example 1: Generated output is nearly identical to expected (e.g., same horizontal fills of 6s in row 20 positions 24-28, same 3-2-8... in rows 21-22 positions 22-23, same 5s/1s in rows 23-24), but marked INCORRECT—likely a subtle overfill or miss in stem processing (e.g., extra 3,2,8... row or failure to trigger special_down for s3 below a type 2 stem run, leaving a blank unfilled; exact diff unknown but present since marked wrong).
 * Stem pairing logic works for simple cases (as in train2) but may mishandle overlap calculation or away-side filling in train1 (e.g., if stems overlap partially, it might process as isolated instead of paired, filling both sides incorrectly).
 * Top/bottom patterns applied correctly in visible fills (e.g., no out-of-bounds), but asymmetry in bottom offsets may cause skips if columns don't fit.
 * Singleton horizontal extension in middle rows is basic but effective; no issues noted.
 * Overall, program copies input faithfully and only fills 8s, avoiding overwrites; early return if !=3 singletons prevents bad runs.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant and build on each other; none appear broken, but process_paired_stem's break after first match may miss complex multi-pair setups (though unlikely).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct and follows the program's logic (e.g., horizontal fills of 9s/6s/7s in rows like 2,5,6,12,25-27 suggest stem-based extensions with colors possibly being singletons like 1,2,3,4; vertical patterns like 1s/2s in col 4-5 rows 0-6 match type 1/2 stems; right-side fills like 2-4 in col 24-25 rows 12-16 suggest middle singleton extension or paired stem away-side).
 * Does not look fully correct: Fills like row 2 cols 16-24 with 9s and row 3 col 18 with 3/4s seem abrupt/incomplete (possibly missed propagation from a top singleton, leaving isolated fills); row 11 cols 24-28 with 2,4,7s looks like bottom pattern but offsets don't align symmetrically (e.g., for s3 at bottom, expected c-4/c-3/c but here spread to 7s); row 29 cols 21-22 with 6,7 and col 26 with 9 seems like special_down trigger but isolated without clear stem run above, suggesting overfill or wrong s3 assumption; blanks remain in areas like row 7-10 entirely 8s, which may be correct if no stems/singletons influence but feels underfilled compared to dense left-side patterns.
 * Likely misses paired stem handling or propagation stops prematurely (e.g., if a mismatch in pattern columns halted vertical fill early, leaving blanks); the output makes sense for isolated stems but not for potential pairs (e.g., cols 4-5 have 1/2 but no away-side fill visible on right); account for multiple singletons propagating overlapping patterns to avoid partial fills in test cases with edge singletons.

[2025-10-01 00:15:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in blank cells (represented by 8) based on patterns derived from three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each) and vertical "stem" structures (long runs of specific values like 1 or 2). The filling rules involve propagating patterns from top/bottom singletons, horizontal extensions in middles, and interactions between adjacent stems, while preserving existing non-blank cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count 1, excluding 8); if not, return the grid unchanged—subtlety: counts only non-8 cells, and singletons are sorted as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singleton) propagate downward in diagonal-ish column offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c-4, c-2, c with colors s3,s2,s1), but only if all three columns are blank in a row; must check bounds and stop if a row can't be fully blank-matched.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singleton) propagate upward with different offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c, c+1, c+4 with colors s1,s2,s3), but only fill if the target row's three columns are entirely blank; direction reverses from top.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) extend horizontally left/right by filling contiguous blanks in the same row with the singleton's color.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 identical cells of 1 or 2; pair adjacent stems of opposite types (1 and 2) if overlapping in rows and neighboring columns, then fill horizontal extensions at specific row offsets (e.g., 0,2,4 for type 1 rightward) with singleton colors in order (s1,s2,s3 or reverse).
 * Isolated stems fill horizontal blanks left/right at offsets, but without direction preference; cap extensions for type 2 stems fill left if above matches and left is blank.
 * Subtlety: Stem filling computes left/right blank lengths but only fills in the "direction" if paired, otherwise opportunistically left or right; offsets vary by type and pairing (e.g., [0,3,length-2] for unpaired type 2).
 * After all processes, re-find stems for cap extensions, as prior fills might create new ones.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns stop propagating if a row has partial matches (must be all blank or all matching); bounds checking prevents out-of-grid access; stems ignore 8s and other values, only count consecutive 1s/2s.
 * Overall: Preserve non-8 cells; output is a deep copy of input with only 8s potentially filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts
```
(This correctly counts non-blank occurrences per color, essential for identifying singletons.)

```python
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```
(This maps singletons to their (row, col) positions, crucial for pattern starting points.)

```python
def find_stems(g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    runs = []
    for col in range(w):
        i = 0
        while i < h:
            val = g[i][col]
            if val == 1 or val == 2:
                cl = val
                start_i = i
                i += 1
                while i < h and g[i][col] == cl:
                    i += 1
                length = i - start_i
                if length >= 4:
                    runs.append((start_i, i, col, cl))
            else:
                i += 1
    return runs
```
(This extracts vertical stem runs of 1/2 >=4 long as (start_row, end_row, col, type), useful for pairing and offset-based filling; re-call after other fills as stems can emerge.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a structured approach: identifies singletons, propagates top/bottom/middle patterns, handles stems with pairing and offsets, and adds cap extensions—shows good high-level understanding of rules like singleton sorting, pattern offsets, and stem interactions.
 * What worked: Core logic for counting singletons, finding positions, and basic stem detection is sound; middle horizontal extension and top/bottom propagation skeletons are mostly correct in intent (e.g., checking blanks before filling, stopping on mismatches).
 * What didn't work: Complete failure due to execution error ("name 'g' is not defined") in get_pat_cols, caused by referencing len(g[0]) without g in scope—blocks all runs; bottom pattern filling has flawed propagation (fills upward but checks blanks incorrectly, potentially overfills); stem filling logic is incomplete/buggy (e.g., offsets for paired stems use hardcoded [0,2,4] etc. but don't always align with colors; isolated fills don't prioritize direction well; right/left length computation is done but filling loops have off-by-one risks or don't use lengths fully).
 * process_top_patterns partially works for downward propagation but skips if bounds invalid; process_bottom_patterns has wrong offsets/colors for bottom (e.g., for s1: [c, c+1, c+4] seems arbitrary, not matching top symmetry) and upward check uses all blanks but fills unconditionally in loop.
 * process_stems overcomplicates pairing (searches all stems but doesn't handle multiple pairs) and offset selection (e.g., for type 2 unpaired: [0,3,length-2] may exceed grid); filling only does one side even if both available.
 * process_cap_extensions is a good idea but only handles left for type 2 and assumes sr>0 without full checks.
 * process_middle is simple and likely correct for horizontal blanks.
 * Overall, no successful runs, so can't verify filling accuracy; unhelpful/broken: get_pat_cols (scoping error, plus asymmetric offsets for top/bottom that may not match puzzle intent); process_bottom_patterns (logic flaws in propagation direction/checks).

**Test output:**
 * All attempts (training 1, training 2, test) resulted in ERROR - Execution error: name 'g' is not defined, due to the scoping issue in get_pat_cols—nothing was generated, so outputs do not make sense or match expected filled grids.
 * Since no actual grid output was produced, can't compare to correct solution, but this error prevents any validation; expected test output should be a filled grid with patterns from singletons/stems, but instead it's unusable—likely the test has singletons and stems that would propagate fills, but code crash hides this.
 * The error is consistent across examples, indicating a fundamental code structure flaw rather than input-specific; fixing scope would allow checking if fills match (e.g., test probably expects specific diagonal-ish fills from top/bottom and horizontal from stems, but current offsets/colors may still mismatch subtly).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

# Existing count function is helpful for identifying singletons pre- and post-fill
def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

# Helpful for finding singleton positions after stem processing
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> dict:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (similar to a logic or pattern-completion puzzle like Fillomino or a variant of nonogram with color rules) where a partial grid with numbers representing colors (1,2,3,4,6,7,9) and blanks (8) must be completed by propagating fills based on detected patterns from unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (runs of 1 or 2 of length >=4). The goal is to fill blanks horizontally and vertically according to specific offset-based rules triggered by isolated stems and singleton positions at the top, bottom, or middle of the grid, ensuring no overfills or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors appearing once each); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent mapping (e.g., s1=1, s2=3, s3=6 in training example 2).
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) in a column, length >=4; only "isolated" stems (no overlapping adjacent stems of the opposite type in neighboring columns) trigger horizontal fills at specific row offsets: for type 1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for type 2, offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1] (where l=stem length)—fills propagate left/right until non-blank or edge.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singletons): Trigger a 3-column pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c>=4: cols [c-4,c-3,c] with [s3,s2,s1]) and propagate downward while rows are all blank in those columns; partial fill starts at row 0.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singletons): Similar but mirrored (e.g., for s1 at c: [c,c+1,c+4] with [s1,s2,s3]), propagate upward; partial fill at bottom row; anchors adjust for s2/s3 positions to fit left/right constraints.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom): Extend horizontally left/right from the singleton's position until non-blank or edge, but only in that row—no vertical propagation.
 * Order matters: Process stems first (as they may create or block patterns), then top patterns, bottom patterns, then middle extensions; avoid filling over existing non-blanks.
 * Subtleties: Patterns may not fill full height if blocked; stems must be exactly isolated (no vertical overlap with opposite-type adjacent stems); offsets can exceed grid height (skip invalid rows); colors like 4,6,7,9 may be pre-filled and influence isolation/blocking; horizontal fills stop at edges or non-8; singletons can be pre-filled in stems or patterns.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; singletons not in expected positions (e.g., too left for anchors) skip pattern placement; multiple singletons may trigger overlapping fills, but propagation checks for all-blank rows prevent conflicts.
 * Potential misses: Not handling partial vertical propagation correctly (e.g., stopping when a pattern row has a non-8); incorrect offset calculations for stems (e.g., l-2 may be invalid); assuming all singletons trigger patterns when only top/bottom do; not sorting singletons leading to color mismatches; stems of length exactly 4 may have offset l-2=2, which could overlap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely simple top/bottom or stem case).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated incorrect horizontal fills from stems (e.g., row 3 left side unfilled as 8's, but expected 6's across cols 0-4; row 1 has 3's instead of expected 3's only partially? Wait, row 1 matches, but row 3 mismatch suggests wrong offset/color for a type-2 stem or isolation failure).
 * In training 2 generated vs expected: Lower section (rows ~10-17, cols ~16-18) shows repeated vertical 2/1/4 but no horizontal extensions or patterned fills (e.g., expected row 11 cols 18-26=3's, row 12=6's, row 14=9's from a bottom or middle pattern, but generated leaves them 8's—likely because place_bottom_pattern or extend_middle didn't trigger due to singleton positions not at exact bottom or incorrect anchor checks; also row 3 cols 0-4=8's vs expected 6's, indicating stem processing skipped or miscolored an isolated stem).
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected some verticals like col 16 1's and col 17 2's/4's), but isolation check or offset application failed for left-side stems.
 * Top/bottom pattern placement worked for upper parts (e.g., row 0/1 partial matches, row 5 9's match), but propagation stopped prematurely or didn't apply to lower singletons.
 * Middle extensions applied minimally (e.g., no horizontals from lower 1/2/4), suggesting pos_dict didn't capture them as middle or extend_middle only hit non-8 blocks immediately.
 * No overfills observed, but underfills dominate failures; count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions seem correct (identified singletons properly).
 * find_stems is helpful but may miss non-1/2 stems or short runs; is_isolated is essential but potentially too strict (e.g., if adjacent stems don't overlap vertically, it should pass—bug if it falsely rejects).
 * fill_horizontal is useful for propagation but doesn't handle vertical checks.
 * place_top_pattern and place_bottom_pattern are partially correct (anchor logic for s1/s2/s3 positions) but fail on propagation (e.g., checks all-blank but may not partial-fill correctly if singleton not blank).
 * extend_middle is broken/incomplete: Only horizontal from middle singletons, but expected shows vertical-like patterns (e.g., staggered horizontals at offsets), suggesting it needs to treat middle as mini-stems or patterns.
 * process_stems orders offsets/colors correctly for types but skips if offsets out-of-bounds; however, in training 2, it filled row 3 cols 14-22 as 4/2's correctly but missed left 6's—likely a separate stem not isolated.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct overall; it shows partial pattern fills (e.g., row 1: 9's in cols 4-7? Wait, row 0 has 1's at cols 4-5; row 1 9's cols 0-3 and 4=4? Inconsistent with singleton rules—singletons seem to be 1,3,4? But fills like row 2 9's cols 6-15 and 3's/2's/1's suggest top-pattern propagation from a row0 singleton, but colors mismatch expected s1/s2/s3 mapping).
 * Upper section: Row 4 full 6's cols 6-28 looks like a horizontal from stem offset, but row 5 full 7's suggests another, yet no vertical stems visible in input (test input not provided, but output implies over-propagation or wrong colors—7's may be pre-filled, but filling over?).
 * Lower section: Row 11 full 9's cols 0-23 then 2/4/7's staggered; row 12 6's cols 0-23 then 2/4; row 13 7's cols 0-23 then 2/4— this looks like bottom-pattern propagation upward, but staggered ends (e.g., 7's in row 12 col 28?) and row 24-28 mirroring upper suggest symmetric but incorrect color assignments (e.g., why 9's then 6's then 7's? Likely wrong s1/s2/s3 or offset misapplication; expected might stagger based on multiple singletons, but output fills too uniformly leftward).
 * Middle empties (rows 7-10, 16-23 all 8's) indicate missed middle extensions or no detected middle singletons (e.g., row 6 has 3's cols 4-5, but no horizontal spread).
 * No obvious overfills, but underfills in potential stem areas (e.g., col 4 has vertical 4/2/6/7/3/8..., suggesting a stem of mixed types not processed); output doesn't match puzzle logic as fills seem to ignore isolation (e.g., adjacent columns filled similarly without check).
 * Test has wider grid (29 cols?) with more pre-fills (e.g., row 2 has 9's and 3/2/1 clusters), implying complex interactions—output partially captures vertical propagation (e.g., row 4-5 horizontals) but fails on horizontal offsets from lower singletons (e.g., row 24 has 1's/4/2/9's but no full lines).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for simple top/bottom but not for intertwined stems/singletons—likely inherits training 2 bugs (e.g., no patterned horizontals in lower right).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (value 8) are populated with colors (integers 1-9) based on rules involving three unique singletons (colors appearing exactly once), horizontal extensions from them, and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2) that trigger patterned fills either in isolation or when adjacent. The goal is to propagate fills downward/upward or sideways from these elements while respecting existing colors and avoiding overwrites unless matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) must exist initially; if not, no fills occur—subtlety: counts exclude blanks (8), and singletons are sorted.
 * Top patterns: If a singleton is at row 0, it seeds a repeating horizontal triplet pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c: fills s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c, downward until mismatch), but only if columns are valid and cells are blank or match; patterns shift based on which singleton (s1/s2/s3) is the anchor.
 * Bottom patterns: Similar to top but upward from row h-1, with different column offsets (e.g., for s1 at bottom: s1 at c, s2 at c+1, s3 at c+4) and reversed direction.
 * Middle extensions: For non-edge singletons, fill horizontal runs of blanks left/right from the singleton's position with its color—subtlety: this is simple flood-fill but stops at non-blanks.
 * Stems: Vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s (type=1 or 2); processed after other steps, so stems can form dynamically.
 * Adjacent stems: If two stems of opposite types (1 and 2) are in neighboring columns and overlap >=3 rows, fill away from the longer/shorter one in the overlap at offsets [0,1,ol_len//2] with s1/s2/s3 (reversed for type 2), direction based on relative column position—subtlety: only if the current stem's length >= adjacent's; fills stop at non-blanks.
 * Isolated stems: For type 1, fill at offsets [1,3,5] with s1/s2/s3 horizontally both directions; for type 2, offsets [0, length//2, length-2] with s3/s2/s1—subtlety: for type 2 at offset 0, additional downward fills in the next row based on horizontal reach (e.g., if right side reaches a filled cell, fill below the blanks to that point, and mirror opposites).
 * Order matters: Top/bottom/middle first, then stems (stems may use prior fills); no overwrites unless matching; grid is mutable copy.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns don't wrap edges; fills are row-by-row until break on mismatch; isolated type 2 has complex "reached" logic for next-row mirroring (e.g., fill below reached segments and set opposites); adjacent fills are only in overlap and away direction; potential for stems to be created by prior fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns as-is; singletons not at edges skip top/bottom; short overlaps (<3) skip adjacent processing; offsets may exceed length, so unique/sorted handling; type 2 offset 0 special fill checks existing fills in current row to determine next-row propagation.
 * General: Colors seem thematic (1/2 stems, 3-7 fills, 9 sometimes appears but not in singletons here); no diagonal or other interactions; all fills are horizontal or vertical-aligned to anchors.

    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single attempt provided) correctly identifies singletons via counting non-blanks and positions them, which works for seeding patterns if they exist at edges.
 * Top/bottom pattern processing works partially: in train1, it fills some downward/upward triplets (e.g., generated has 2,3 in row3 col18-19 matching expected, and 2,4 in row6), but fails on specifics like row2 col17-19 (generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3? wait, minor; actually row3 generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3, but row2 generated 2,4 vs expected 2,4—discrepancy in presentation but seems partial match; however, overfills or misses in lower sections).
 * Middle extensions work for horizontal fills from non-edge singletons, but in train1, it doesn't appear to trigger much (e.g., singleton 1 at row10 col2 extends? but generated doesn't show full horizontals).
 * Stem finding is helpful and detects long vertical 1/2 runs, but processing fails: in train1, isolated stems like bottom 1-stem and 2-stem get partial horizontal fills (e.g., row16-17 has 4,3,3,3,3,4 and 2,2,2,2,2,2,4 matching expected), but type2 offset0 special downward mirroring is broken (e.g., row18 has 8,1,5 vs expected 8,1,5—minor, but later rows like row20 has 4,2,6,6,6,6,6 vs expected 4,2,6,6,6,6,6; actually mismatches in row21: generated 4,2,6 vs expected 3,2,8—wrong color s1=1 vs s3=3?); adjacent stems not handled well (train1 has no clear adjacents, but overfills elsewhere).
 * In train2, singletons (1,3,6?) processed poorly: top/bottom patterns miss (e.g., generated fills 1,2 vertical but expected has more 3/6 extensions); stems like left 3/6/9 verticals get no fills, while right 1/2/4 get partial but wrong (row11 generated 2,1,3,3,3,... vs expected 4,1,3,3,3—wrong starting color); isolated stem logic applies incorrectly, leading to extra 1/2 fills in empty areas.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure (singletons + stems) but bugs in pattern offsets (e.g., bottom pat_cols for s3 wrong?), adjacent overlap calc (skips valid?), and type2 special fill (reach detection flawed, e.g., temp_j unused, mirroring opposites incorrectly sets non-singleton colors); no handling for post-fill stem recreation (runs after all processes?); unhelpful: process_stems has redundant direction code for adjacent (if step==-1 repeated); the whole adjacent block skips if length < other_len but doesn't swap perspective.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills and mismatches expected patterns based on mental simulation of rules.
 * Singletons likely 1,2,4 (appear once: 1 at row0 col4-5? wait input has two 1s? wait, input row0 has two 1s, but counts would see multiples—program returns early if !=3 singletons, but generated fills anyway? Bug: perhaps counts wrong or fills ignore check.
 * Top patterns should seed from potential top singleton (e.g., if 1 at row0 col4, but duplicates; mental: no clear top singleton, so minimal top fills; generated has row1 4,1 but input already has, then row2 4,2,9...—seems partial match but adds 9s wrongly.
 * Stems: Clear type2 stem at col5 rows0-6 (1? wait input has 1,1 at row0 col4-5, but 2 at row2-4 col5? Mixed; long 7-stem? No, stems only 1/2; generated ignores, fills unrelated 9/7 elsewhere (e.g., row2 has 9s extended wrongly from input 9s).
 * Bottom/middle: Input has bottom-ish 6/7/9, but generated adds 1,4 at row15-16 wrongly; horizontal extensions from 2/4 at row14-15 partial but adds extra 7s.
 * Adjacent stems missing: Potential col4 (3s short) and col5 (2s) not adjacent properly; generated row25-28 has 4,2,9/7 but expected likely mirrors from type2 offset0 (downward from row4 col5 2, but input sparse).
 * Overall, fills like row12 9s extended left/right from input but shouldn't (not singleton/stem triggered); test has more colors (7,9) not in singletons, so rules may need generalization beyond s1/s2/s3 for fills—program assumes only s1-3 colors, leading to blanks remaining or wrong propagation; does not make sense as it creates inconsistent patterns (e.g., isolated 7-stem in row4 not processed as stem since !=1/2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle similar to a nonogram or pattern-propagation challenge, where a partially filled grid (with numbers 1-9 as colors and 8 as blanks) must be completed by identifying three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each), detecting vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2), and applying specific filling rules like horizontal extensions, vertical propagations from top/bottom singletons, and isolated stem patterns to propagate colors logically without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors with count==1); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) of length >=4 in a column; type 1 stems (value=1) and type 2 (value=2) have opposite behaviors, with isolation checked against adjacent columns (c-1 or c+1) for opposite-type stems of equal or longer length that overlap vertically.
 * For isolated stems, fill horizontals at specific row offsets: type 1 uses offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; type 2 uses [0,3,length-2] with [s3,s2,s1]; extend left/right from the stem column until non-blank or edge.
 * Subtlety for type 1 stems: Check for a left-prefix (adjacent left column with >=2 consistent non-stem/non-blank cells); if present, fill an extra row (offset=2) rightward with s1 and set the left cell to the prefix color if it's blank/stem.
 * Top-row singletons (r==0) trigger diagonal-ish patterns: depending on which singleton (s1/s2/s3), select column offsets like [-4,-2,0] for s1, and propagate downward only if all pattern columns are blank or match the color in each row.
 * Bottom-row singletons (r==h-1) use asymmetric patterns: e.g., for s1 [0,1,4], propagate upward similarly, but offsets are irregular (e.g., negative for s3).
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right with their color until non-blank.
 * Propagation stops if a row can't be fully matched (any pattern column out-of-bounds or non-matching non-blank).
 * Subtle: Stem processing happens before singleton patterns, so it can pre-fill areas that affect later propagations; avoid overfilling by checking for 8 only.
 * Grids can be tall/narrow (e.g., 21x27 or 29 cols in test); ensure bounds checks (0 <= j < w).
 * No diagonal or complex interactions beyond stems/singletons; unfilled areas remain 8.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for top/bottom are color-ordered differently (top: [s3,s2,s1], bottom: [s1,s2,s3]); isolation requires no vertical overlap with qualifying opposite stems.

(Note: Similar propagate_bottom_pattern exists but propagates upward; process_stem_fills handles isolated stem horizontal fills with offsets and left-prefix logic; extend_middle_horizontal does simple left/right extension. These are all helpful for core logic but may need tweaks for overfilling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly handled Training example 1 by properly identifying singletons (e.g., assuming 3,6,9), stems, and propagations to fill the full expected grid without errors.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output overfilled horizontals in the bottom section—e.g., row 10 (0-indexed) has 4,1 followed by nine 3's extending right to col26, but expected has only 4,1 and blanks after (no 3's); row 11 has 4,1,3's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks; row 12 has 2,1, six 6's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks before six 6's? Wait, parsing shows generated extended 3's and misplaced 2's/4's in rows 10-18, likely due to incorrect stem isolation or offset filling in process_stem_fills allowing overlaps or wrong colors (e.g., s1=3? assuming singletons 1,3,6 or similar, but code sorted s1<s2<s3 and applied [s1,s2,s3] wrongly).
 * Stem processing pre-fills interfered with singleton patterns, causing extra fills in non-isolated areas (e.g., generated row 2 has extra 1's and 4's not in expected? No, row 2 matches, but bottom mismatches suggest non-isolated stems were processed anyway).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially (e.g., top fills like row0-1 3's and row3 6's match), but middle/bottom horizontals overextended (e.g., generated row14 has nine 9's, expected matches, but adjacent rows don't).
 * Function is_isolated seems correct but may miss subtle overlaps; process_stem_fills' left-prefix logic might trigger falsely, filling extras (unknown why in this case).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but propagate functions could be stricter on "can_fill" to prevent partial matches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It identifies singletons (likely 1,3,9 or similar, given fills) and applies some stem fills (e.g., row4-5 wide 6's and 7's from a type2 stem?), top/bottom patterns (e.g., row1-2 9's and 3's propagating down, row25-28 9's/6's/7's from bottom), and horizontals (e.g., row11 wide 9's), but overfills inconsistently—e.g., row2 has 9's then 3's/2's/1's clumped awkwardly without clear pattern match, row16 has 1,4 but no further propagation upward despite bottom rules; row7-10 are mostly blank but should propagate from nearby stems/singletons (e.g., col4 has 3's in row6 but no extension); row23-24 have isolated 1's/4's/2's without horizontal extension, suggesting missed middle singleton rule or bounds issues in wider 29-col grid; overall, it fills ~60% logically but leaves gaps (e.g., row6 3's not extended) and adds extras (e.g., row12 wide 9's may overstep isolation), so rules like stem offsets or pattern cols need adjustment for asymmetric grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill blank cells (8s) with colors (1-9) based on patterns seeded by exactly three singleton colors (appearing once each), which propagate horizontally and vertically, while interacting with vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s at least 4 cells long) to extend fills in specific directions and offsets. The puzzle relies on relative positioning of singletons and stems, with rules for top/bottom/middle placements, stem types (1 vs. 2), pairing checks to avoid overfilling, and conditional propagation based on adjacent filled cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (sorted as s1 < s2 < s3) must exist; if not, no filling occurs—easy to miss edge cases where counts change mid-process due to prior fills.
 * Top patterns (if singleton in row 0) use every-other-column spacing (e.g., c, c+2, c+4 for s1 at c) with colors [s1,s2,s3] or reversed variants, propagating downward only if compatible (blanks or matching colors).
 * Bottom patterns (if singleton in last row) use irregular spacing (e.g., c, c+1, c+3 for s1) with colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward with similar compatibility checks—subtle asymmetry in column offsets vs. top.
 * Middle singletons (not edges) extend horizontally left/right through contiguous blanks with the singleton's color, but only in that row—no vertical propagation here.
 * Stems are vertical runs of uniform 1 or 2 (type=cl) >=4 long; process after singletons to avoid interference.
 * Type 1 stems (color 1): Fill unpaired sides (left/right if no adjacent type 2 stem overlaps in rows) at offsets 1,3,5 from start with s1,s2,s3 horizontally—subtle: offsets must be < length, and "paired" checks row overlap strictly (max(start) < min(end)).
 * Type 2 stems (color 2): Only if isolated (no adjacent type 1 overlapping); for each side, count contiguous horizontal blanks at offset 0, check if ends with s3; fill offset 0 with s3 up to that count, s2 at offsets [3] or [3, length-2] if ends with s3, s1 at (length-1) or (length-2)—easy to miss: fills are horizontal from stem column, and s2 has conditional extra offset based on s3 adjacency.
 * Propagation stops if incompatible (out of bounds or mismatch); all fills overwrite only 8s, preserve existing colors.
 * Order matters: Singletons first (top/bottom/middle), then stems—mid-process fills can create new stems or change counts, but code copies grid and counts initial non-blanks only.
 * Subtle: Patterns assume sorted singletons, but placement depends on which singleton (sk) is at the position; column checks prevent out-of-bounds.
 * No diagonal or other interactions; colors beyond singletons (e.g., multiples of 3-7,9) are treated as fixed clues.
 * Potential overfill risk: Stem fills might overlap singleton propagations, but compatibility checks mitigate.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly identifies singletons and processes top/bottom/middle patterns, as seen in train2 succeeding fully.
 * For train1 (incorrect): Generated output filled left-side stems and some right-side horizontals (e.g., rows 0-6 match expected with 1,5,6 patterns), but failed to fill vertical propagations on the right (e.g., rows 10-15 have many 8s where expected has vertical 1,5,6 repeating; row 17 has 8,1,5,8,8,6 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6—wait, similar but row 18 has 8,1,5,8,6,1,1,1 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6 with later fills; row 23 has 8,1,5,8,8,6,8,1,5 vs. expected with 5s; row 24 has 1s at end vs. expected 1s but positioned differently)—likely due to type2 stem processing not triggering extra s2 offsets or s1 placement correctly, leaving blanks; also, row 22 has 3,2,5,5,5,5,5 vs. expected 3,2,1,1,1,1,1 (mismatch in vertical fill at bottom-right).
 * Train1 also overfilled or mismatched in bottom-right (e.g., row 20: 3,2,8s vs. expected 3,2,8s—matches, but propagation stopped early); unknown why vertical singleton patterns (e.g., from row9 col2=1) didn't propagate fully downward like in expected.
 * Stem processing order/issues: Type1 fills happened, but type2 isolation check or condition for extra s2_off (based on s3 adjacency) failed, preventing full right-side fills; paired check for type1 might have wrongly skipped a side.
 * Middle horizontal extension worked partially (e.g., row8 2s extended), but didn't interact well with stems.
 * Function `get_top_pattern` and `get_bottom_pattern` are helpful but subtle—bottom has non-symmetric offsets (c+1,c+3 vs. top's even spacing), which may cause misalignment in irregular grids.
 * Function `process_type1_stem` is mostly correct but misses if stem length <5 (skips s3), which happened in train1 (length=6? but offsets up to5).
 * Function `process_type2_stem` is broken/incomplete: Fills s3 at offset0 correctly in some cases, but s2_offs logic ( [3] or [3,length-2] if condition) and s1_off (length-1 or -2) didn't trigger extra fills in train1 right-side, leaving verticals blank; also, fills s3 horizontally but code has fill_stem_direction which is horizontal—wait, it's correct but condition= s3 at next_cc may not detect properly if s3 is from prior fill.
 * `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and worked (e.g., singleton 4 in row7 extended), but limited to single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands singleton seeding and basic propagation but underfills complex stem interactions, especially type2 conditionals and vertical chaining.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identified singletons (likely 1,2,3 or similar, but grid has 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 visible), filled top-left patterns (e.g., row0-1 has 1s at col4-5, row2 has 2,9s), vertical stems (e.g., row4-5 full 6s and 7s), bottom patterns (row11 full 9s with 2,4,7), and some middle extensions (row12-15 2,4 with verticals); right-side has partial 6,7,9 in rows17-28, suggesting type1/2 stem processing from col21-22.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Many 8s remain (e.g., rows6-10 almost empty except col4-5 3s; row16 has 1,4 but no extension; rows17-28 have sparse 6,7,9 at col21-22 but no horizontal fills from stems or singleton propagation—e.g., no s1/s2/s3 offsets visible); left-bottom (row28 col9-10 3s) seems isolated without propagation; unknown singletons but assuming 1,2,3, top singleton at row0 col4=1 should propagate [1,?,?] down col4,5,? but row2 col5=2, row3 col5=1 mismatch? Wait, perhaps s1=1,s2=2,s3=3, but bottom row11 has 2,4,7 which doesn't match pattern; likely type2 stem at col5 (2s in row2-5?) didn't fill horizontals properly to right (e.g., no 3,4 extensions beyond); right-side verticals (6,7,9) seem like fixed clues, not propagated from singletons—output underfills connections between left stems and right blanks.
 * Test output misses full propagation: E.g., if singleton 1 at row15 col24, middle horizontal should fill row15 blanks around col24 with 1s, but it's 1,4—no extension left/right; bottom singleton? (none obvious) didn't trigger upward fills; stem at col4 (4,2,6,7,3?) isn't uniform 1/2, so no processing, leaving gaps.
 * To handle test: Need better stem detection post-all fills (code does single pass), recount singletons after initial propagations, and fix type2 condition to detect s3 from clues (not just blanks).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-9) and blanks (8), where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules centered on three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each) and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2). The filling uses patterned horizontal extensions from stems and vertical propagations from singletons at edges, with the program attempting to automate this logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * There must be exactly 3 singleton colors (colors appearing once); if not, no filling occurs beyond copying the input—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Stems are vertical runs of the same value (1 or 2 only) of length >=4 in a column; type is the value (1 or 2), and they can be isolated (no adjacent overlapping stem of the opposite type in neighboring column) or paired (adjacent column has opposite type with row overlap).
 * For isolated stems: Fill horizontal blanks to left and right at specific row offsets from stem start (for type 1: offsets 1,3,5 with colors s1,s2,s3; for type 2: offsets 0,3,length-2 with s3,s2,s1); fill extends across consecutive blanks in the direction until non-blank.
 * For paired stems: Only fill on the "away" side (direction opposite the pair) using the same offsets/colors as isolated; if the longer stem determines processing, use its length for offsets.
 * Special rule in process_stem_side for type 2 at offset 0: If a horizontal run of blanks exists and the cell immediately after the run in the direction is s3, fill the row below the run span with s3 (but only if downward and within bounds).
 * Singleton positions: If at top row (row 0), apply top pattern (3-column offset based on which singleton k is: e.g., for k=s1, columns c-4/c-2/c with colors s3/s2/s1); propagate downward row-by-row if the 3 columns match the pattern colors or are blank, filling blanks.
 * If at bottom row (row h-1), apply bottom pattern (asymmetric offsets: e.g., for k=s1, columns c/c+1/c+4 with s1/s2/s3); propagate upward similarly.
 * If singleton in middle row, simply extend its color horizontally across all consecutive blanks in that row (left and right).
 * Propagation subtlety: Only continues while all 3 pattern columns per row are either blank or already match the required color; stops on mismatch; fills only blanks, doesn't overwrite existing colors.
 * Stem detection requires exact run matching (no interruptions); paired detection checks for opposite type, adjacent column (abs(col diff)=1), and row overlap (max(start) < min(end)).
 * Counts exclude blanks (8); existing colors in grid must not be overwritten—program copies input and only fills 8s.
 * Edge cases: Short stems (<4) ignored; patterns must fit within width (0 to w-1), else skipped; downward/upward propagation stops at bounds; for type 2 offsets, length-2 may exceed height, so check r < h.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping stems/pairs may cause double-filling attempts (but since only fill 8s, it's safe but could propagate wrong if not checked); singleton patterns assume sorted s1/s2/s3, so wrong sorting breaks colors; horizontal extensions in stems don't propagate vertically unless special_down triggers.

(Note: process_isolated_stem and process_paired_stem orchestrate offsets/colors for sides; main program ties everything together by processing stems first, then singletons.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies singletons and stems, and handles propagation and horizontal extensions well, as evidenced by passing Training example 2 completely.
 * Failed Training example 1: Generated output is nearly identical to expected (e.g., same horizontal fills of 6s in row 20 positions 24-28, same 3-2-8... in rows 21-22 positions 22-23, same 5s/1s in rows 23-24), but marked INCORRECT—likely a subtle overfill or miss in stem processing (e.g., extra 3,2,8... row or failure to trigger special_down for s3 below a type 2 stem run, leaving a blank unfilled; exact diff unknown but present since marked wrong).
 * Stem pairing logic works for simple cases (as in train2) but may mishandle overlap calculation or away-side filling in train1 (e.g., if stems overlap partially, it might process as isolated instead of paired, filling both sides incorrectly).
 * Top/bottom patterns applied correctly in visible fills (e.g., no out-of-bounds), but asymmetry in bottom offsets may cause skips if columns don't fit.
 * Singleton horizontal extension in middle rows is basic but effective; no issues noted.
 * Overall, program copies input faithfully and only fills 8s, avoiding overwrites; early return if !=3 singletons prevents bad runs.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant and build on each other; none appear broken, but process_paired_stem's break after first match may miss complex multi-pair setups (though unlikely).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct and follows the program's logic (e.g., horizontal fills of 9s/6s/7s in rows like 2,5,6,12,25-27 suggest stem-based extensions with colors possibly being singletons like 1,2,3,4; vertical patterns like 1s/2s in col 4-5 rows 0-6 match type 1/2 stems; right-side fills like 2-4 in col 24-25 rows 12-16 suggest middle singleton extension or paired stem away-side).
 * Does not look fully correct: Fills like row 2 cols 16-24 with 9s and row 3 col 18 with 3/4s seem abrupt/incomplete (possibly missed propagation from a top singleton, leaving isolated fills); row 11 cols 24-28 with 2,4,7s looks like bottom pattern but offsets don't align symmetrically (e.g., for s3 at bottom, expected c-4/c-3/c but here spread to 7s); row 29 cols 21-22 with 6,7 and col 26 with 9 seems like special_down trigger but isolated without clear stem run above, suggesting overfill or wrong s3 assumption; blanks remain in areas like row 7-10 entirely 8s, which may be correct if no stems/singletons influence but feels underfilled compared to dense left-side patterns.
 * Likely misses paired stem handling or propagation stops prematurely (e.g., if a mismatch in pattern columns halted vertical fill early, leaving blanks); the output makes sense for isolated stems but not for potential pairs (e.g., cols 4-5 have 1/2 but no away-side fill visible on right); account for multiple singletons propagating overlapping patterns to avoid partial fills in test cases with edge singletons.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:22:21] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a partially filled grid (where 8 represents blanks and 1-9 are colors) that must be completed by propagating fills based on unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2). The rules emphasize pattern matching around singletons at edges or middles, and directional filling from stems, with interactions between paired stems.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * There must be exactly 3 singletons (colors appearing once); if not, no fills occur—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Top/bottom patterns are anchor triplets of columns with specific color orders (e.g., for top, if singleton sk is s1, pattern is s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c; propagate vertically down/up if compatible).
 * Middle singletons trigger horizontal extensions to fill adjacent blanks in the same row.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (type 1, "top-heavy") or 2 (type 2, "bottom-heavy") of length >=4; fills from stems use fixed offsets (e.g., for type 1: s1 at +1, s2 at +3, s3 at +5; for type 2: s3 at 0, s2 at +3, s1 at ln-2 if ln>=6) and propagate horizontally in directions (-1 and/or +1) based on partner stems (opposite type, adjacent column, overlapping rows).
 * Partner stems block filling toward them; if no partners or unpaired sides, fill both directions; if length > partner length, fill away from partners.
 * Propagation only fills if cells are 8 or match the color; stop if conflict.
 * Subtle: Stem fills are row-specific offsets from start, and only if offset < length; directions are determined by unpaired sides (away from partners); runs must be contiguous same color.
 * Counts exclude blanks (8); positions are exact for singletons.
 * Order matters: Process singletons first (top/bottom/middle), then stems on updated grid.
 * Easy to miss: For type 2 stems, s1 offset is ln-2 only if ln>=6; patterns must fit within width (0 to w-1); no diagonal or other fills.
 * If singletons not at edges/middles, or stems <4, limited propagation.
 * Potential overfill: Horizontal stem propagation can chain if blanks are adjacent, but must check compatibility each step.
 * Underfill risk: If partners overlap but don't block correctly, or if stem length condition fails.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * get_top_pattern and get_bottom_pattern: Seem correct but may have wrong column offsets or color orders for some cases, leading to invalid patterns (e.g., out-of-bounds or mismatches in training 1).
 * extend_middle_horizontal: Works for basics but overfills if not checked against existing colors, causing extras in training 1.
 * Overall program: Stem partner logic under-detects overlaps or miscalculates directions, leading to underfills (e.g., training 2 misses horizontal fills like 3s/6s/9s next to singletons).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; both training examples failed due to incorrect fills from stems and patterns.
 * Training 1: Generated overfills left columns (e.g., rows 10-15 have [1,1,1,5,...] and [5,5,1,5,...] where expected has all 8s; also extra 1/5/6 in rows 18-25); correctly identified some right-side patterns (e.g., row 19 4s, row 20 4,2,6s) but propagated too aggressively from middle singletons or stems.
 * Training 1: Stem fills likely triggered horizontal chains incorrectly, filling blanks that should remain 8 (unknown why, perhaps no partner check or wrong offsets); top/bottom patterns partially worked (e.g., row 0 4s, row 1 2,4 correct) but didn't propagate fully.
 * Training 2: Generated underfills key areas (e.g., row 11 has 4,1,8s... where expected has 4,1,3s...; row 12 has 2,1,8s where expected 2,1,6s; row 14 has 2,1,8s where expected 2,1,9s); missed horizontal propagations from stems or patterns near singletons (e.g., 1 at col5 triggers but doesn't fill adjacent colors like 3/6/9).
 * Training 2: Singleton positions correct (e.g., 1 spans multiple rows in col5), but stem detection or do_stem_fills failed to apply offsets/directions properly, leaving blanks; no overfills, suggesting conservative propagation.
 * General: Assumes exactly 3 singletons, which holds but fails if counts change mid-process; stem partners not blocking correctly (e.g., in train1, unpaired stems fill both sides, causing extras); order of processing (singletons then stems) is good but needs iteration if new singletons emerge (not handled).
 * find_stems is helpful but may detect partial runs if grid updates mid-way (runs on copy, but propagation before stems helps).
 * count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions are essential and correct, as they accurately identify s1/s2/s3 and positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., horizontal fills from apparent stems like row5 all 7s, row11 all 9s up to 2,4,7s; vertical propagations in col24 like 2,4 down to row15) but looks incorrect overall, as it leaves many blanks unfilled where patterns suggest more (e.g., singleton 1 at row0 col4 should trigger top/middle patterns, but col0-3 remain 8s in row0; row2 has 3,2,2s but no further horizontal from 2-stem?).
 * Missing fills: No propagation from bottom singletons (e.g., row16 col24 1,4 doesn't extend up/down fully; row25-28 have scattered 4,2,9s/7s but expected denser patterns based on stems in col9-10); underfills around col20-21 6,7 (only vertical, no horizontal from offsets).
 * Extra fills: Row12 all 9s seems over-aggressive (if from type2 stem offset 0=s3=9?, but chains too far without bounds check); row2 9s propagate right but stop abruptly at col18, possibly missing partner logic.
 * Does not look fully correct: Training failures suggest stem directions/offsets are buggy, so test likely misses key horizontal fills (e.g., from 3-stem in col4 rows6-7? should fill s1/s2/s3 horizontally); vertical 7s in row5 and col28 suggest stem detection works, but incomplete (e.g., no fills in row6-7 col4 from type1? offsets).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:22:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in blank cells (represented by 8) based on patterns derived from three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each) and vertical "stem" structures (long runs of specific values like 1 or 2). The filling rules involve propagating patterns from top/bottom singletons, horizontal extensions in middles, and interactions between adjacent stems, while preserving existing non-blank cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count 1, excluding 8); if not, return the grid unchanged—subtlety: counts only non-8 cells, and singletons are sorted as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singleton) propagate downward in diagonal-ish column offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c-4, c-2, c with colors s3,s2,s1), but only if all three columns are blank in a row; must check bounds and stop if a row can't be fully blank-matched.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singleton) propagate upward with different offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c, c+1, c+4 with colors s1,s2,s3), but only fill if the target row's three columns are entirely blank; direction reverses from top.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) extend horizontally left/right by filling contiguous blanks in the same row with the singleton's color.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 identical cells of 1 or 2; pair adjacent stems of opposite types (1 and 2) if overlapping in rows and neighboring columns, then fill horizontal extensions at specific row offsets (e.g., 0,2,4 for type 1 rightward) with singleton colors in order (s1,s2,s3 or reverse).
 * Isolated stems fill horizontal blanks left/right at offsets, but without direction preference; cap extensions for type 2 stems fill left if above matches and left is blank.
 * Subtlety: Stem filling computes left/right blank lengths but only fills in the "direction" if paired, otherwise opportunistically left or right; offsets vary by type and pairing (e.g., [0,3,length-2] for unpaired type 2).
 * After all processes, re-find stems for cap extensions, as prior fills might create new ones.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns stop propagating if a row has partial matches (must be all blank or all matching); bounds checking prevents out-of-grid access; stems ignore 8s and other values, only count consecutive 1s/2s.
 * Overall: Preserve non-8 cells; output is a deep copy of input with only 8s potentially filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts
```
(This correctly counts non-blank occurrences per color, essential for identifying singletons.)

```python
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```
(This maps singletons to their (row, col) positions, crucial for pattern starting points.)

```python
def find_stems(g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    runs = []
    for col in range(w):
        i = 0
        while i < h:
            val = g[i][col]
            if val == 1 or val == 2:
                cl = val
                start_i = i
                i += 1
                while i < h and g[i][col] == cl:
                    i += 1
                length = i - start_i
                if length >= 4:
                    runs.append((start_i, i, col, cl))
            else:
                i += 1
    return runs
```
(This extracts vertical stem runs of 1/2 >=4 long as (start_row, end_row, col, type), useful for pairing and offset-based filling; re-call after other fills as stems can emerge.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a structured approach: identifies singletons, propagates top/bottom/middle patterns, handles stems with pairing and offsets, and adds cap extensions—shows good high-level understanding of rules like singleton sorting, pattern offsets, and stem interactions.
 * What worked: Core logic for counting singletons, finding positions, and basic stem detection is sound; middle horizontal extension and top/bottom propagation skeletons are mostly correct in intent (e.g., checking blanks before filling, stopping on mismatches).
 * What didn't work: Complete failure due to execution error ("name 'g' is not defined") in get_pat_cols, caused by referencing len(g[0]) without g in scope—blocks all runs; bottom pattern filling has flawed propagation (fills upward but checks blanks incorrectly, potentially overfills); stem filling logic is incomplete/buggy (e.g., offsets for paired stems use hardcoded [0,2,4] etc. but don't always align with colors; isolated fills don't prioritize direction well; right/left length computation is done but filling loops have off-by-one risks or don't use lengths fully).
 * process_top_patterns partially works for downward propagation but skips if bounds invalid; process_bottom_patterns has wrong offsets/colors for bottom (e.g., for s1: [c, c+1, c+4] seems arbitrary, not matching top symmetry) and upward check uses all blanks but fills unconditionally in loop.
 * process_stems overcomplicates pairing (searches all stems but doesn't handle multiple pairs) and offset selection (e.g., for type 2 unpaired: [0,3,length-2] may exceed grid); filling only does one side even if both available.
 * process_cap_extensions is a good idea but only handles left for type 2 and assumes sr>0 without full checks.
 * process_middle is simple and likely correct for horizontal blanks.
 * Overall, no successful runs, so can't verify filling accuracy; unhelpful/broken: get_pat_cols (scoping error, plus asymmetric offsets for top/bottom that may not match puzzle intent); process_bottom_patterns (logic flaws in propagation direction/checks).

**Test output:**
 * All attempts (training 1, training 2, test) resulted in ERROR - Execution error: name 'g' is not defined, due to the scoping issue in get_pat_cols—nothing was generated, so outputs do not make sense or match expected filled grids.
 * Since no actual grid output was produced, can't compare to correct solution, but this error prevents any validation; expected test output should be a filled grid with patterns from singletons/stems, but instead it's unusable—likely the test has singletons and stems that would propagate fills, but code crash hides this.
 * The error is consistent across examples, indicating a fundamental code structure flaw rather than input-specific; fixing scope would allow checking if fills match (e.g., test probably expects specific diagonal-ish fills from top/bottom and horizontal from stems, but current offsets/colors may still mismatch subtly).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

            c = g[i][j]

                counts[c] += 1
    return counts

            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (similar to a logic or pattern-completion puzzle like Fillomino or a variant of nonogram with color rules) where a partial grid with numbers representing colors (1,2,3,4,6,7,9) and blanks (8) must be completed by propagating fills based on detected patterns from unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (runs of 1 or 2 of length >=4). The goal is to fill blanks horizontally and vertically according to specific offset-based rules triggered by isolated stems and singleton positions at the top, bottom, or middle of the grid, ensuring no overfills or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors appearing once each); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent mapping (e.g., s1=1, s2=3, s3=6 in training example 2).
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) in a column, length >=4; only "isolated" stems (no overlapping adjacent stems of the opposite type in neighboring columns) trigger horizontal fills at specific row offsets: for type 1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for type 2, offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1] (where l=stem length)—fills propagate left/right until non-blank or edge.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singletons): Trigger a 3-column pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c>=4: cols [c-4,c-3,c] with [s3,s2,s1]) and propagate downward while rows are all blank in those columns; partial fill starts at row 0.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singletons): Similar but mirrored (e.g., for s1 at c: [c,c+1,c+4] with [s1,s2,s3]), propagate upward; partial fill at bottom row; anchors adjust for s2/s3 positions to fit left/right constraints.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom): Extend horizontally left/right from the singleton's position until non-blank or edge, but only in that row—no vertical propagation.
 * Order matters: Process stems first (as they may create or block patterns), then top patterns, bottom patterns, then middle extensions; avoid filling over existing non-blanks.
 * Subtleties: Patterns may not fill full height if blocked; stems must be exactly isolated (no vertical overlap with opposite-type adjacent stems); offsets can exceed grid height (skip invalid rows); colors like 4,6,7,9 may be pre-filled and influence isolation/blocking; horizontal fills stop at edges or non-8; singletons can be pre-filled in stems or patterns.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; singletons not in expected positions (e.g., too left for anchors) skip pattern placement; multiple singletons may trigger overlapping fills, but propagation checks for all-blank rows prevent conflicts.
 * Potential misses: Not handling partial vertical propagation correctly (e.g., stopping when a pattern row has a non-8); incorrect offset calculations for stems (e.g., l-2 may be invalid); assuming all singletons trigger patterns when only top/bottom do; not sorting singletons leading to color mismatches; stems of length exactly 4 may have offset l-2=2, which could overlap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely simple top/bottom or stem case).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated incorrect horizontal fills from stems (e.g., row 3 left side unfilled as 8's, but expected 6's across cols 0-4; row 1 has 3's instead of expected 3's only partially? Wait, row 1 matches, but row 3 mismatch suggests wrong offset/color for a type-2 stem or isolation failure).
 * In training 2 generated vs expected: Lower section (rows ~10-17, cols ~16-18) shows repeated vertical 2/1/4 but no horizontal extensions or patterned fills (e.g., expected row 11 cols 18-26=3's, row 12=6's, row 14=9's from a bottom or middle pattern, but generated leaves them 8's—likely because place_bottom_pattern or extend_middle didn't trigger due to singleton positions not at exact bottom or incorrect anchor checks; also row 3 cols 0-4=8's vs expected 6's, indicating stem processing skipped or miscolored an isolated stem).
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected some verticals like col 16 1's and col 17 2's/4's), but isolation check or offset application failed for left-side stems.
 * Top/bottom pattern placement worked for upper parts (e.g., row 0/1 partial matches, row 5 9's match), but propagation stopped prematurely or didn't apply to lower singletons.
 * Middle extensions applied minimally (e.g., no horizontals from lower 1/2/4), suggesting pos_dict didn't capture them as middle or extend_middle only hit non-8 blocks immediately.
 * No overfills observed, but underfills dominate failures; count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions seem correct (identified singletons properly).
 * find_stems is helpful but may miss non-1/2 stems or short runs; is_isolated is essential but potentially too strict (e.g., if adjacent stems don't overlap vertically, it should pass—bug if it falsely rejects).
 * fill_horizontal is useful for propagation but doesn't handle vertical checks.
 * place_top_pattern and place_bottom_pattern are partially correct (anchor logic for s1/s2/s3 positions) but fail on propagation (e.g., checks all-blank but may not partial-fill correctly if singleton not blank).
 * extend_middle is broken/incomplete: Only horizontal from middle singletons, but expected shows vertical-like patterns (e.g., staggered horizontals at offsets), suggesting it needs to treat middle as mini-stems or patterns.
 * process_stems orders offsets/colors correctly for types but skips if offsets out-of-bounds; however, in training 2, it filled row 3 cols 14-22 as 4/2's correctly but missed left 6's—likely a separate stem not isolated.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct overall; it shows partial pattern fills (e.g., row 1: 9's in cols 4-7? Wait, row 0 has 1's at cols 4-5; row 1 9's cols 0-3 and 4=4? Inconsistent with singleton rules—singletons seem to be 1,3,4? But fills like row 2 9's cols 6-15 and 3's/2's/1's suggest top-pattern propagation from a row0 singleton, but colors mismatch expected s1/s2/s3 mapping).
 * Upper section: Row 4 full 6's cols 6-28 looks like a horizontal from stem offset, but row 5 full 7's suggests another, yet no vertical stems visible in input (test input not provided, but output implies over-propagation or wrong colors—7's may be pre-filled, but filling over?).
 * Lower section: Row 11 full 9's cols 0-23 then 2/4/7's staggered; row 12 6's cols 0-23 then 2/4; row 13 7's cols 0-23 then 2/4— this looks like bottom-pattern propagation upward, but staggered ends (e.g., 7's in row 12 col 28?) and row 24-28 mirroring upper suggest symmetric but incorrect color assignments (e.g., why 9's then 6's then 7's? Likely wrong s1/s2/s3 or offset misapplication; expected might stagger based on multiple singletons, but output fills too uniformly leftward).
 * Middle empties (rows 7-10, 16-23 all 8's) indicate missed middle extensions or no detected middle singletons (e.g., row 6 has 3's cols 4-5, but no horizontal spread).
 * No obvious overfills, but underfills in potential stem areas (e.g., col 4 has vertical 4/2/6/7/3/8..., suggesting a stem of mixed types not processed); output doesn't match puzzle logic as fills seem to ignore isolation (e.g., adjacent columns filled similarly without check).
 * Test has wider grid (29 cols?) with more pre-fills (e.g., row 2 has 9's and 3/2/1 clusters), implying complex interactions—output partially captures vertical propagation (e.g., row 4-5 horizontals) but fails on horizontal offsets from lower singletons (e.g., row 24 has 1's/4/2/9's but no full lines).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for simple top/bottom but not for intertwined stems/singletons—likely inherits training 2 bugs (e.g., no patterned horizontals in lower right).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (value 8) are populated with colors (integers 1-9) based on rules involving three unique singletons (colors appearing exactly once), horizontal extensions from them, and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2) that trigger patterned fills either in isolation or when adjacent. The goal is to propagate fills downward/upward or sideways from these elements while respecting existing colors and avoiding overwrites unless matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) must exist initially; if not, no fills occur—subtlety: counts exclude blanks (8), and singletons are sorted.
 * Top patterns: If a singleton is at row 0, it seeds a repeating horizontal triplet pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c: fills s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c, downward until mismatch), but only if columns are valid and cells are blank or match; patterns shift based on which singleton (s1/s2/s3) is the anchor.
 * Bottom patterns: Similar to top but upward from row h-1, with different column offsets (e.g., for s1 at bottom: s1 at c, s2 at c+1, s3 at c+4) and reversed direction.
 * Middle extensions: For non-edge singletons, fill horizontal runs of blanks left/right from the singleton's position with its color—subtlety: this is simple flood-fill but stops at non-blanks.
 * Stems: Vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s (type=1 or 2); processed after other steps, so stems can form dynamically.
 * Adjacent stems: If two stems of opposite types (1 and 2) are in neighboring columns and overlap >=3 rows, fill away from the longer/shorter one in the overlap at offsets [0,1,ol_len//2] with s1/s2/s3 (reversed for type 2), direction based on relative column position—subtlety: only if the current stem's length >= adjacent's; fills stop at non-blanks.
 * Isolated stems: For type 1, fill at offsets [1,3,5] with s1/s2/s3 horizontally both directions; for type 2, offsets [0, length//2, length-2] with s3/s2/s1—subtlety: for type 2 at offset 0, additional downward fills in the next row based on horizontal reach (e.g., if right side reaches a filled cell, fill below the blanks to that point, and mirror opposites).
 * Order matters: Top/bottom/middle first, then stems (stems may use prior fills); no overwrites unless matching; grid is mutable copy.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns don't wrap edges; fills are row-by-row until break on mismatch; isolated type 2 has complex "reached" logic for next-row mirroring (e.g., fill below reached segments and set opposites); adjacent fills are only in overlap and away direction; potential for stems to be created by prior fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns as-is; singletons not at edges skip top/bottom; short overlaps (<3) skip adjacent processing; offsets may exceed length, so unique/sorted handling; type 2 offset 0 special fill checks existing fills in current row to determine next-row propagation.
 * General: Colors seem thematic (1/2 stems, 3-7 fills, 9 sometimes appears but not in singletons here); no diagonal or other interactions; all fills are horizontal or vertical-aligned to anchors.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single attempt provided) correctly identifies singletons via counting non-blanks and positions them, which works for seeding patterns if they exist at edges.
 * Top/bottom pattern processing works partially: in train1, it fills some downward/upward triplets (e.g., generated has 2,3 in row3 col18-19 matching expected, and 2,4 in row6), but fails on specifics like row2 col17-19 (generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3? wait, minor; actually row3 generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3, but row2 generated 2,4 vs expected 2,4—discrepancy in presentation but seems partial match; however, overfills or misses in lower sections).
 * Middle extensions work for horizontal fills from non-edge singletons, but in train1, it doesn't appear to trigger much (e.g., singleton 1 at row10 col2 extends? but generated doesn't show full horizontals).
 * Stem finding is helpful and detects long vertical 1/2 runs, but processing fails: in train1, isolated stems like bottom 1-stem and 2-stem get partial horizontal fills (e.g., row16-17 has 4,3,3,3,3,4 and 2,2,2,2,2,2,4 matching expected), but type2 offset0 special downward mirroring is broken (e.g., row18 has 8,1,5 vs expected 8,1,5—minor, but later rows like row20 has 4,2,6,6,6,6,6 vs expected 4,2,6,6,6,6,6; actually mismatches in row21: generated 4,2,6 vs expected 3,2,8—wrong color s1=1 vs s3=3?); adjacent stems not handled well (train1 has no clear adjacents, but overfills elsewhere).
 * In train2, singletons (1,3,6?) processed poorly: top/bottom patterns miss (e.g., generated fills 1,2 vertical but expected has more 3/6 extensions); stems like left 3/6/9 verticals get no fills, while right 1/2/4 get partial but wrong (row11 generated 2,1,3,3,3,... vs expected 4,1,3,3,3—wrong starting color); isolated stem logic applies incorrectly, leading to extra 1/2 fills in empty areas.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure (singletons + stems) but bugs in pattern offsets (e.g., bottom pat_cols for s3 wrong?), adjacent overlap calc (skips valid?), and type2 special fill (reach detection flawed, e.g., temp_j unused, mirroring opposites incorrectly sets non-singleton colors); no handling for post-fill stem recreation (runs after all processes?); unhelpful: process_stems has redundant direction code for adjacent (if step==-1 repeated); the whole adjacent block skips if length < other_len but doesn't swap perspective.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills and mismatches expected patterns based on mental simulation of rules.
 * Singletons likely 1,2,4 (appear once: 1 at row0 col4-5? wait input has two 1s? wait, input row0 has two 1s, but counts would see multiples—program returns early if !=3 singletons, but generated fills anyway? Bug: perhaps counts wrong or fills ignore check.
 * Top patterns should seed from potential top singleton (e.g., if 1 at row0 col4, but duplicates; mental: no clear top singleton, so minimal top fills; generated has row1 4,1 but input already has, then row2 4,2,9...—seems partial match but adds 9s wrongly.
 * Stems: Clear type2 stem at col5 rows0-6 (1? wait input has 1,1 at row0 col4-5, but 2 at row2-4 col5? Mixed; long 7-stem? No, stems only 1/2; generated ignores, fills unrelated 9/7 elsewhere (e.g., row2 has 9s extended wrongly from input 9s).
 * Bottom/middle: Input has bottom-ish 6/7/9, but generated adds 1,4 at row15-16 wrongly; horizontal extensions from 2/4 at row14-15 partial but adds extra 7s.
 * Adjacent stems missing: Potential col4 (3s short) and col5 (2s) not adjacent properly; generated row25-28 has 4,2,9/7 but expected likely mirrors from type2 offset0 (downward from row4 col5 2, but input sparse).
 * Overall, fills like row12 9s extended left/right from input but shouldn't (not singleton/stem triggered); test has more colors (7,9) not in singletons, so rules may need generalization beyond s1/s2/s3 for fills—program assumes only s1-3 colors, leading to blanks remaining or wrong propagation; does not make sense as it creates inconsistent patterns (e.g., isolated 7-stem in row4 not processed as stem since !=1/2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly identified singletons (e.g., in train1, s1=1,s2=2,s3=3) and their positions, enabling basic pattern triggering.
 * Successfully filled some top/bottom 3-column propagations (e.g., train1 top with 2-3-4? but mismatched colors; bottom with 2-3-1 correctly in parts).
 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a partially filled grid (where 8 represents blanks and 1-9 are colors) that must be completed by propagating fills based on unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2). The rules emphasize pattern matching around singletons at edges or middles, and directional filling from stems, with interactions between paired stems.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * There must be exactly 3 singletons (colors appearing once); if not, no fills occur—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Top/bottom patterns are anchor triplets of columns with specific color orders (e.g., for top, if singleton sk is s1, pattern is s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c; propagate vertically down/up if compatible).
 * Middle singletons trigger horizontal extensions to fill adjacent blanks in the same row.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (type 1, "top-heavy") or 2 (type 2, "bottom-heavy") of length >=4; fills from stems use fixed offsets (e.g., for type 1: s1 at +1, s2 at +3, s3 at +5; for type 2: s3 at 0, s2 at +3, s1 at ln-2 if ln>=6) and propagate horizontally in directions (-1 and/or +1) based on partner stems (opposite type, adjacent column, overlapping rows).
 * Partner stems block filling toward them; if no partners or unpaired sides, fill both directions; if length > partner length, fill away from partners.
 * Propagation only fills if cells are 8 or match the color; stop if conflict.
 * Subtle: Stem fills are row-specific offsets from start, and only if offset < length; directions are determined by unpaired sides (away from partners); runs must be contiguous same color.
 * Counts exclude blanks (8); positions are exact for singletons.
 * Order matters: Process singletons first (top/bottom/middle), then stems on updated grid.
 * Easy to miss: For type 2 stems, s1 offset is ln-2 only if ln>=6; patterns must fit within width (0 to w-1); no diagonal or other fills.
 * If singletons not at edges/middles, or stems <4, limited propagation.
 * Potential overfill: Horizontal stem propagation can chain if blanks are adjacent, but must check compatibility each step.
 * Underfill risk: If partners overlap but don't block correctly, or if stem length condition fails.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * get_top_pattern and get_bottom_pattern: Seem correct but may have wrong column offsets or color orders for some cases, leading to invalid patterns (e.g., out-of-bounds or mismatches in training 1).
 * extend_middle_horizontal: Works for basics but overfills if not checked against existing colors, causing extras in training 1.
 * Overall program: Stem partner logic under-detects overlaps or miscalculates directions, leading to underfills (e.g., training 2 misses horizontal fills like 3s/6s/9s next to singletons).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; both training examples failed due to incorrect fills from stems and patterns.
 * Training 1: Generated overfills left columns (e.g., rows 10-15 have [1,1,1,5,...] and [5,5,1,5,...] where expected has all 8s; also extra 1/5/6 in rows 18-25); correctly identified some right-side patterns (e.g., row 19 4s, row 20 4,2,6s) but propagated too aggressively from middle singletons or stems.
 * Training 1: Stem fills likely triggered horizontal chains incorrectly, filling blanks that should remain 8 (unknown why, perhaps no partner check or wrong offsets); top/bottom patterns partially worked (e.g., row 0 4s, row 1 2,4 correct) but didn't propagate fully.
 * Training 2: Generated underfills key areas (e.g., row 11 has 4,1,8s... where expected has 4,1,3s...; row 12 has 2,1,8s where expected 2,1,6s; row 14 has 2,1,8s where expected 2,1,9s); missed horizontal propagations from stems or patterns near singletons (e.g., 1 at col5 triggers but doesn't fill adjacent colors like 3/6/9).
 * Training 2: Singleton positions correct (e.g., 1 spans multiple rows in col5), but stem detection or do_stem_fills failed to apply offsets/directions properly, leaving blanks; no overfills, suggesting conservative propagation.
 * General: Assumes exactly 3 singletons, which holds but fails if counts change mid-process; stem partners not blocking correctly (e.g., in train1, unpaired stems fill both sides, causing extras); order of processing (singletons then stems) is good but needs iteration if new singletons emerge (not handled).
 * find_stems is helpful but may detect partial runs if grid updates mid-way (runs on copy, but propagation before stems helps).
 * count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions are essential and correct, as they accurately identify s1/s2/s3 and positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., horizontal fills from apparent stems like row5 all 7s, row11 all 9s up to 2,4,7s; vertical propagations in col24 like 2,4 down to row15) but looks incorrect overall, as it leaves many blanks unfilled where patterns suggest more (e.g., singleton 1 at row0 col4 should trigger top/middle patterns, but col0-3 remain 8s in row0; row2 has 3,2,2s but no further horizontal from 2-stem?).
 * Missing fills: No propagation from bottom singletons (e.g., row16 col24 1,4 doesn't extend up/down fully; row25-28 have scattered 4,2,9s/7s but expected denser patterns based on stems in col9-10); underfills around col20-21 6,7 (only vertical, no horizontal from offsets).
 * Extra fills: Row12 all 9s seems over-aggressive (if from type2 stem offset 0=s3=9?, but chains too far without bounds check); row2 9s propagate right but stop abruptly at col18, possibly missing partner logic.
 * Does not look fully correct: Training failures suggest stem directions/offsets are buggy, so test likely misses key horizontal fills (e.g., from 3-stem in col4 rows6-7? should fill s1/s2/s3 horizontally); vertical 7s in row5 and col28 suggest stem detection works, but incomplete (e.g., no fills in row6-7 col4 from type1? offsets).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle similar to a nonogram or pattern-propagation challenge, where a partially filled grid (with numbers 1-9 as colors and 8 as blanks) must be completed by identifying three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each), detecting vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2), and applying specific filling rules like horizontal extensions, vertical propagations from top/bottom singletons, and isolated stem patterns to propagate colors logically without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors with count==1); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) of length >=4 in a column; type 1 stems (value=1) and type 2 (value=2) have opposite behaviors, with isolation checked against adjacent columns (c-1 or c+1) for opposite-type stems of equal or longer length that overlap vertically.
 * For isolated stems, fill horizontals at specific row offsets: type 1 uses offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; type 2 uses [0,3,length-2] with [s3,s2,s1]; extend left/right from the stem column until non-blank or edge.
 * Subtlety for type 1 stems: Check for a left-prefix (adjacent left column with >=2 consistent non-stem/non-blank cells); if present, fill an extra row (offset=2) rightward with s1 and set the left cell to the prefix color if it's blank/stem.
 * Top-row singletons (r==0) trigger diagonal-ish patterns: depending on which singleton (s1/s2/s3), select column offsets like [-4,-2,0] for s1, and propagate downward only if all pattern columns are blank or match the color in each row.
 * Bottom-row singletons (r==h-1) use asymmetric patterns: e.g., for s1 [0,1,4], propagate upward similarly, but offsets are irregular (e.g., negative for s3).
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right with their color until non-blank.
 * Propagation stops if a row can't be fully matched (any pattern column out-of-bounds or non-matching non-blank).
 * Subtle: Stem processing happens before singleton patterns, so it can pre-fill areas that affect later propagations; avoid overfilling by checking for 8 only.
 * Grids can be tall/narrow (e.g., 21x27 or 29 cols in test); ensure bounds checks (0 <= j < w).
 * No diagonal or complex interactions beyond stems/singletons; unfilled areas remain 8.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for top/bottom are color-ordered differently (top: [s3,s2,s1], bottom: [s1,s2,s3]); isolation requires no vertical overlap with qualifying opposite stems.

(Note: Similar propagate_bottom_pattern exists but propagates upward; process_stem_fills handles isolated stem horizontal fills with offsets and left-prefix logic; extend_middle_horizontal does simple left/right extension. These are all helpful for core logic but may need tweaks for overfilling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly handled Training example 1 by properly identifying singletons (e.g., assuming 3,6,9), stems, and propagations to fill the full expected grid without errors.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output overfilled horizontals in the bottom section—e.g., row 10 (0-indexed) has 4,1 followed by nine 3's extending right to col26, but expected has only 4,1 and blanks after (no 3's); row 11 has 4,1,3's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks; row 12 has 2,1, six 6's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks before six 6's? Wait, parsing shows generated extended 3's and misplaced 2's/4's in rows 10-18, likely due to incorrect stem isolation or offset filling in process_stem_fills allowing overlaps or wrong colors (e.g., s1=3? assuming singletons 1,3,6 or similar, but code sorted s1<s2<s3 and applied [s1,s2,s3] wrongly).
 * Stem processing pre-fills interfered with singleton patterns, causing extra fills in non-isolated areas (e.g., generated row 2 has extra 1's and 4's not in expected? No, row 2 matches, but bottom mismatches suggest non-isolated stems were processed anyway).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially (e.g., top fills like row0-1 3's and row3 6's match), but middle/bottom horizontals overextended (e.g., generated row14 has nine 9's, expected matches, but adjacent rows don't).
 * Function is_isolated seems correct but may miss subtle overlaps; process_stem_fills' left-prefix logic might trigger falsely, filling extras (unknown why in this case).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but propagate functions could be stricter on "can_fill" to prevent partial matches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It identifies singletons (likely 1,3,9 or similar, given fills) and applies some stem fills (e.g., row4-5 wide 6's and 7's from a type2 stem?), top/bottom patterns (e.g., row1-2 9's and 3's propagating down, row25-28 9's/6's/7's from bottom), and horizontals (e.g., row11 wide 9's), but overfills inconsistently—e.g., row2 has 9's then 3's/2's/1's clumped awkwardly without clear pattern match, row16 has 1,4 but no further propagation upward despite bottom rules; row7-10 are mostly blank but should propagate from nearby stems/singletons (e.g., col4 has 3's in row6 but no extension); row23-24 have isolated 1's/4's/2's without horizontal extension, suggesting missed middle singleton rule or bounds issues in wider 29-col grid; overall, it fills ~60% logically but leaves gaps (e.g., row6 3's not extended) and adds extras (e.g., row12 wide 9's may overstep isolation), so rules like stem offsets or pattern cols need adjustment for asymmetric grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill blank cells (8s) with colors (1-9) based on patterns seeded by exactly three singleton colors (appearing once each), which propagate horizontally and vertically, while interacting with vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s at least 4 cells long) to extend fills in specific directions and offsets. The puzzle relies on relative positioning of singletons and stems, with rules for top/bottom/middle placements, stem types (1 vs. 2), pairing checks to avoid overfilling, and conditional propagation based on adjacent filled cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (sorted as s1 < s2 < s3) must exist; if not, no filling occurs—easy to miss edge cases where counts change mid-process due to prior fills.
 * Top patterns (if singleton in row 0) use every-other-column spacing (e.g., c, c+2, c+4 for s1 at c) with colors [s1,s2,s3] or reversed variants, propagating downward only if compatible (blanks or matching colors).
 * Bottom patterns (if singleton in last row) use irregular spacing (e.g., c, c+1, c+3 for s1) with colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward with similar compatibility checks—subtle asymmetry in column offsets vs. top.
 * Middle singletons (not edges) extend horizontally left/right through contiguous blanks with the singleton's color, but only in that row—no vertical propagation here.
 * Stems are vertical runs of uniform 1 or 2 (type=cl) >=4 long; process after singletons to avoid interference.
 * Type 1 stems (color 1): Fill unpaired sides (left/right if no adjacent type 2 stem overlaps in rows) at offsets 1,3,5 from start with s1,s2,s3 horizontally—subtle: offsets must be < length, and "paired" checks row overlap strictly (max(start) < min(end)).
 * Type 2 stems (color 2): Only if isolated (no adjacent type 1 overlapping); for each side, count contiguous horizontal blanks at offset 0, check if ends with s3; fill offset 0 with s3 up to that count, s2 at offsets [3] or [3, length-2] if ends with s3, s1 at (length-1) or (length-2)—easy to miss: fills are horizontal from stem column, and s2 has conditional extra offset based on s3 adjacency.
 * Propagation stops if incompatible (out of bounds or mismatch); all fills overwrite only 8s, preserve existing colors.
 * Order matters: Singletons first (top/bottom/middle), then stems—mid-process fills can create new stems or change counts, but code copies grid and counts initial non-blanks only.
 * Subtle: Patterns assume sorted singletons, but placement depends on which singleton (sk) is at the position; column checks prevent out-of-bounds.
 * No diagonal or other interactions; colors beyond singletons (e.g., multiples of 3-7,9) are treated as fixed clues.
 * Potential overfill risk: Stem fills might overlap singleton propagations, but compatibility checks mitigate.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly identifies singletons and processes top/bottom/middle patterns, as seen in train2 succeeding fully.
 * For train1 (incorrect): Generated output filled left-side stems and some right-side horizontals (e.g., rows 0-6 match expected with 1,5,6 patterns), but failed to fill vertical propagations on the right (e.g., rows 10-15 have many 8s where expected has vertical 1,5,6 repeating; row 17 has 8,1,5,8,8,6 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6—wait, similar but row 18 has 8,1,5,8,6,1,1,1 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6 with later fills; row 23 has 8,1,5,8,8,6,8,1,5 vs. expected with 5s; row 24 has 1s at end vs. expected 1s but positioned differently)—likely due to type2 stem processing not triggering extra s2 offsets or s1 placement correctly, leaving blanks; also, row 22 has 3,2,5,5,5,5,5 vs. expected 3,2,1,1,1,1,1 (mismatch in vertical fill at bottom-right).
 * Train1 also overfilled or mismatched in bottom-right (e.g., row 20: 3,2,8s vs. expected 3,2,8s—matches, but propagation stopped early); unknown why vertical singleton patterns (e.g., from row9 col2=1) didn't propagate fully downward like in expected.
 * Stem processing order/issues: Type1 fills happened, but type2 isolation check or condition for extra s2_off (based on s3 adjacency) failed, preventing full right-side fills; paired check for type1 might have wrongly skipped a side.
 * Middle horizontal extension worked partially (e.g., row8 2s extended), but didn't interact well with stems.
 * Function `get_top_pattern` and `get_bottom_pattern` are helpful but subtle—bottom has non-symmetric offsets (c+1,c+3 vs. top's even spacing), which may cause misalignment in irregular grids.
 * Function `process_type1_stem` is mostly correct but misses if stem length <5 (skips s3), which happened in train1 (length=6? but offsets up to5).
 * Function `process_type2_stem` is broken/incomplete: Fills s3 at offset0 correctly in some cases, but s2_offs logic ( [3] or [3,length-2] if condition) and s1_off (length-1 or -2) didn't trigger extra fills in train1 right-side, leaving verticals blank; also, fills s3 horizontally but code has fill_stem_direction which is horizontal—wait, it's correct but condition= s3 at next_cc may not detect properly if s3 is from prior fill.
 * `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and worked (e.g., singleton 4 in row7 extended), but limited to single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands singleton seeding and basic propagation but underfills complex stem interactions, especially type2 conditionals and vertical chaining.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identified singletons (likely 1,2,3 or similar, but grid has 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 visible), filled top-left patterns (e.g., row0-1 has 1s at col4-5, row2 has 2,9s), vertical stems (e.g., row4-5 full 6s and 7s), bottom patterns (row11 full 9s with 2,4,7), and some middle extensions (row12-15 2,4 with verticals); right-side has partial 6,7,9 in rows17-28, suggesting type1/2 stem processing from col21-22.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Many 8s remain (e.g., rows6-10 almost empty except col4-5 3s; row16 has 1,4 but no extension; rows17-28 have sparse 6,7,9 at col21-22 but no horizontal fills from stems or singleton propagation—e.g., no s1/s2/s3 offsets visible); left-bottom (row28 col9-10 3s) seems isolated without propagation; unknown singletons but assuming 1,2,3, top singleton at row0 col4=1 should propagate [1,?,?] down col4,5,? but row2 col5=2, row3 col5=1 mismatch? Wait, perhaps s1=1,s2=2,s3=3, but bottom row11 has 2,4,7 which doesn't match pattern; likely type2 stem at col5 (2s in row2-5?) didn't fill horizontals properly to right (e.g., no 3,4 extensions beyond); right-side verticals (6,7,9) seem like fixed clues, not propagated from singletons—output underfills connections between left stems and right blanks.
 * Test output misses full propagation: E.g., if singleton 1 at row15 col24, middle horizontal should fill row15 blanks around col24 with 1s, but it's 1,4—no extension left/right; bottom singleton? (none obvious) didn't trigger upward fills; stem at col4 (4,2,6,7,3?) isn't uniform 1/2, so no processing, leaving gaps.
 * To handle test: Need better stem detection post-all fills (code does single pass), recount singletons after initial propagations, and fix type2 condition to detect s3 from clues (not just blanks).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-9) and blanks (8), where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules centered on three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each) and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2). The filling uses patterned horizontal extensions from stems and vertical propagations from singletons at edges, with the program attempting to automate this logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * There must be exactly 3 singleton colors (colors appearing once); if not, no filling occurs beyond copying the input—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Stems are vertical runs of the same value (1 or 2 only) of length >=4 in a column; type is the value (1 or 2), and they can be isolated (no adjacent overlapping stem of the opposite type in neighboring column) or paired (adjacent column has opposite type with row overlap).
 * For isolated stems: Fill horizontal blanks to left and right at specific row offsets from stem start (for type 1: offsets 1,3,5 with colors s1,s2,s3; for type 2: offsets 0,3,length-2 with s3,s2,s1); fill extends across consecutive blanks in the direction until non-blank.
 * For paired stems: Only fill on the "away" side (direction opposite the pair) using the same offsets/colors as isolated; if the longer stem determines processing, use its length for offsets.
 * Special rule in process_stem_side for type 2 at offset 0: If a horizontal run of blanks exists and the cell immediately after the run in the direction is s3, fill the row below the run span with s3 (but only if downward and within bounds).
 * Singleton positions: If at top row (row 0), apply top pattern (3-column offset based on which singleton k is: e.g., for k=s1, columns c-4/c-2/c with colors s3/s2/s1); propagate downward row-by-row if the 3 columns match the pattern colors or are blank, filling blanks.
 * If at bottom row (row h-1), apply bottom pattern (asymmetric offsets: e.g., for k=s1, columns c/c+1/c+4 with s1/s2/s3); propagate upward similarly.
 * If singleton in middle row, simply extend its color horizontally across all consecutive blanks in that row (left and right).
 * Propagation subtlety: Only continues while all 3 pattern columns per row are either blank or already match the required color; stops on mismatch; fills only blanks, doesn't overwrite existing colors.
 * Stem detection requires exact run matching (no interruptions); paired detection checks for opposite type, adjacent column (abs(col diff)=1), and row overlap (max(start) < min(end)).
 * Counts exclude blanks (8); existing colors in grid must not be overwritten—program copies input and only fills 8s.
 * Edge cases: Short stems (<4) ignored; patterns must fit within width (0 to w-1), else skipped; downward/upward propagation stops at bounds; for type 2 offsets, length-2 may exceed height, so check r < h.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping stems/pairs may cause double-filling attempts (but since only fill 8s, it's safe but could propagate wrong if not checked); singleton patterns assume sorted s1/s2/s3, so wrong sorting breaks colors; horizontal extensions in stems don't propagate vertically unless special_down triggers.

(Note: process_isolated_stem and process_paired_stem orchestrate offsets/colors for sides; main program ties everything together by processing stems first, then singletons.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies singletons and stems, and handles propagation and horizontal extensions well, as evidenced by passing Training example 2 completely.
 * Failed Training example 1: Generated output is nearly identical to expected (e.g., same horizontal fills of 6s in row 20 positions 24-28, same 3-2-8... in rows 21-22 positions 22-23, same 5s/1s in rows 23-24), but marked INCORRECT—likely a subtle overfill or miss in stem processing (e.g., extra 3,2,8... row or failure to trigger special_down for s3 below a type 2 stem run, leaving a blank unfilled; exact diff unknown but present since marked wrong).
 * Stem pairing logic works for simple cases (as in train2) but may mishandle overlap calculation or away-side filling in train1 (e.g., if stems overlap partially, it might process as isolated instead of paired, filling both sides incorrectly).
 * Top/bottom patterns applied correctly in visible fills (e.g., no out-of-bounds), but asymmetry in bottom offsets may cause skips if columns don't fit.
 * Singleton horizontal extension in middle rows is basic but effective; no issues noted.
 * Overall, program copies input faithfully and only fills 8s, avoiding overwrites; early return if !=3 singletons prevents bad runs.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant and build on each other; none appear broken, but process_paired_stem's break after first match may miss complex multi-pair setups (though unlikely).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct and follows the program's logic (e.g., horizontal fills of 9s/6s/7s in rows like 2,5,6,12,25-27 suggest stem-based extensions with colors possibly being singletons like 1,2,3,4; vertical patterns like 1s/2s in col 4-5 rows 0-6 match type 1/2 stems; right-side fills like 2-4 in col 24-25 rows 12-16 suggest middle singleton extension or paired stem away-side).
 * Does not look fully correct: Fills like row 2 cols 16-24 with 9s and row 3 col 18 with 3/4s seem abrupt/incomplete (possibly missed propagation from a top singleton, leaving isolated fills); row 11 cols 24-28 with 2,4,7s looks like bottom pattern but offsets don't align symmetrically (e.g., for s3 at bottom, expected c-4/c-3/c but here spread to 7s); row 29 cols 21-22 with 6,7 and col 26 with 9 seems like special_down trigger but isolated without clear stem run above, suggesting overfill or wrong s3 assumption; blanks remain in areas like row 7-10 entirely 8s, which may be correct if no stems/singletons influence but feels underfilled compared to dense left-side patterns.
 * Likely misses paired stem handling or propagation stops prematurely (e.g., if a mismatch in pattern columns halted vertical fill early, leaving blanks); the output makes sense for isolated stems but not for potential pairs (e.g., cols 4-5 have 1/2 but no away-side fill visible on right); account for multiple singletons propagating overlapping patterns to avoid partial fills in test cases with edge singletons.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 00:28:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are completed based on patterns derived from rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1s or 2s), with rules for top/bottom patterns, horizontal extensions, and isolated stem extensions using the singletons. The goal is to propagate fills logically without overfilling, ensuring the output matches the expected completed grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must be exactly three unique colors with count 1 each; sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use them to fill patterns—failure to identify or sort correctly leads to no fills or wrong colors.
 * Top patterns trigger only if a singleton is in row 0; they check/fill specific column offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c-4,c-2,c with colors s3,s2,s1) starting from row 0 and propagate down while blanks align, but stop if mismatch.
 * Bottom patterns trigger if singleton in last row; similar offset-based fills (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c,c+1,c+4 with s1,s2,s3) but propagate upward from near-bottom, stopping on mismatch—offsets differ from top and seem asymmetric/irregular.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) extend horizontally left/right from their position with their own color until non-blank.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (type 1) or 2 (type 2) of length >=4 in a column; only process if "isolated" (no adjacent column with overlapping opposite-type stem of equal or longer length).
 * For isolated stems, extend horizontally from specific row offsets within the stem: for type 1, offsets 1(s1),3(s2),5(s3); for type 2, offsets 0(s3),3(s2),len-2(s1); extend left/right until non-blank—subtle: offsets must be < length, and row = start_row + offset must be valid.
 * Process order matters: top/bottom first, then middle extensions, then stems (using updated grid for stem detection)—overfills happen if stems extend into already-filled areas incorrectly.
 * Blanks (8) are fillable only if matching pattern; non-8 cells block propagation.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 29 cols in train 1, variable height); validate column indices to avoid index errors.
 * Subtle asymmetry in bottom patterns (e.g., irregular offsets like c+1 for s1) and stem offsets suggests puzzle-specific rules, possibly visual (e.g., mimicking shapes like arrows or trees).
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons from sorted keys with count==1—easy to miss if other colors have count 1 but aren't used.
 * Isolation check for stems: only adjacent cols (abs(oc - c)==1), opposite type, and overlap (max(starts) < min(ends)) with opp length >= this length—miss this and stems over-extend.
 * No fills if <3 singletons; copy input otherwise.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it failed on Training example 1 by overfilling left-side areas (e.g., row 10 filled [1,1,1,...] instead of [8,8,1,...]; rows 11-15 filled vertical 1s and 5s incorrectly where expected has all 8s except specific positions).
 * Succeeded on Training example 2, correctly handling its patterns (likely due to different singleton positions and stems not triggering overfills).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially in train 1 (e.g., matched rows 0-9 and 16-26), but stem processing caused overfills, suggesting isolation check or offset logic failed (e.g., processed non-isolated stems or wrong offsets).
 * Middle extensions seemed correct (no obvious mismatches there).
 * Stem detection via find_stems is helpful but process_stem over-applied fills, possibly because it used the updated grid after prior steps, leading to unintended propagations.
 * Bottom pattern offsets appear buggy or asymmetric (e.g., for s1: c,c+1,c+4 seems off, causing partial mismatches in train 1 row 26).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but process_top_pattern and process_bottom_pattern could be refined for stricter mismatch stopping; extend_middle_horizontal is simple and likely correct.
 * count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions are essential and worked (correctly identified s1=1,s2=5,s3=6 in train 1).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills patterns (e.g., horizontal extensions in rows 1-2,11-14 for colors like 9,6,7; vertical stems in cols 21-22 filled with 6,7; some singleton-based fills like row 25 with 3,3), which seems logically consistent with the rules but may overfill or miss subtleties.
 * It does not look fully correct: e.g., row 0 has [8,8,8,8,1,1,8,...] but input has 1 at col4, so middle extension should fill horizontally from there, but output only shows two 1s—possibly incomplete; row 2 has 9s extended but stops abruptly, and row 25 has 2,4 but input has no clear trigger there.
 * Bottom-area fills (rows 18-29) show repeated 6,7,9 but sparse, suggesting stem extensions happened but perhaps missed isolation (e.g., col21 has long 6 run, col22 7, adjacent opposites—should not extend if overlapping >= length).
 * Overall, it makes partial sense (captures some top/middle/stem logic) but likely incorrect due to same issues as train 1 (over/under-filling stems), e.g., row 29 has 3,3 at end but input has none, unexplained; needs better isolation/offset handling for test's complex layout (multiple stems, singletons at 1,2,3?).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:28:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in blank cells (represented by 8) based on patterns derived from three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each) and vertical "stem" structures (long runs of specific values like 1 or 2). The filling rules involve propagating patterns from top/bottom singletons, horizontal extensions in middles, and interactions between adjacent stems, while preserving existing non-blank cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count 1, excluding 8); if not, return the grid unchanged—subtlety: counts only non-8 cells, and singletons are sorted as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singleton) propagate downward in diagonal-ish column offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c-4, c-2, c with colors s3,s2,s1), but only if all three columns are blank in a row; must check bounds and stop if a row can't be fully blank-matched.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singleton) propagate upward with different offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c, c+1, c+4 with colors s1,s2,s3), but only fill if the target row's three columns are entirely blank; direction reverses from top.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) extend horizontally left/right by filling contiguous blanks in the same row with the singleton's color.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 identical cells of 1 or 2; pair adjacent stems of opposite types (1 and 2) if overlapping in rows and neighboring columns, then fill horizontal extensions at specific row offsets (e.g., 0,2,4 for type 1 rightward) with singleton colors in order (s1,s2,s3 or reverse).
 * Isolated stems fill horizontal blanks left/right at offsets, but without direction preference; cap extensions for type 2 stems fill left if above matches and left is blank.
 * Subtlety: Stem filling computes left/right blank lengths but only fills in the "direction" if paired, otherwise opportunistically left or right; offsets vary by type and pairing (e.g., [0,3,length-2] for unpaired type 2).
 * After all processes, re-find stems for cap extensions, as prior fills might create new ones.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns stop propagating if a row has partial matches (must be all blank or all matching); bounds checking prevents out-of-grid access; stems ignore 8s and other values, only count consecutive 1s/2s.
 * Overall: Preserve non-8 cells; output is a deep copy of input with only 8s potentially filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def count_non_blanks(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    h = len(g)
    if h == 0:
        return {}
    w = len(g[0])
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c != 8:
                counts[c] += 1
    return counts
```
(This correctly counts non-blank occurrences per color, essential for identifying singletons.)

```python
def find_singleton_positions(g: List[List[int]], singletons: List[int]) -> Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    pos_dict = {}
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            cc = g[i][j]
            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```
(This maps singletons to their (row, col) positions, crucial for pattern starting points.)

```python
def find_stems(g: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    runs = []
    for col in range(w):
        i = 0
        while i < h:
            val = g[i][col]
            if val == 1 or val == 2:
                cl = val
                start_i = i
                i += 1
                while i < h and g[i][col] == cl:
                    i += 1
                length = i - start_i
                if length >= 4:
                    runs.append((start_i, i, col, cl))
            else:
                i += 1
    return runs
```
(This extracts vertical stem runs of 1/2 >=4 long as (start_row, end_row, col, type), useful for pairing and offset-based filling; re-call after other fills as stems can emerge.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program attempts a structured approach: identifies singletons, propagates top/bottom/middle patterns, handles stems with pairing and offsets, and adds cap extensions—shows good high-level understanding of rules like singleton sorting, pattern offsets, and stem interactions.
 * What worked: Core logic for counting singletons, finding positions, and basic stem detection is sound; middle horizontal extension and top/bottom propagation skeletons are mostly correct in intent (e.g., checking blanks before filling, stopping on mismatches).
 * What didn't work: Complete failure due to execution error ("name 'g' is not defined") in get_pat_cols, caused by referencing len(g[0]) without g in scope—blocks all runs; bottom pattern filling has flawed propagation (fills upward but checks blanks incorrectly, potentially overfills); stem filling logic is incomplete/buggy (e.g., offsets for paired stems use hardcoded [0,2,4] etc. but don't always align with colors; isolated fills don't prioritize direction well; right/left length computation is done but filling loops have off-by-one risks or don't use lengths fully).
 * process_top_patterns partially works for downward propagation but skips if bounds invalid; process_bottom_patterns has wrong offsets/colors for bottom (e.g., for s1: [c, c+1, c+4] seems arbitrary, not matching top symmetry) and upward check uses all blanks but fills unconditionally in loop.
 * process_stems overcomplicates pairing (searches all stems but doesn't handle multiple pairs) and offset selection (e.g., for type 2 unpaired: [0,3,length-2] may exceed grid); filling only does one side even if both available.
 * process_cap_extensions is a good idea but only handles left for type 2 and assumes sr>0 without full checks.
 * process_middle is simple and likely correct for horizontal blanks.
 * Overall, no successful runs, so can't verify filling accuracy; unhelpful/broken: get_pat_cols (scoping error, plus asymmetric offsets for top/bottom that may not match puzzle intent); process_bottom_patterns (logic flaws in propagation direction/checks).

**Test output:**
 * All attempts (training 1, training 2, test) resulted in ERROR - Execution error: name 'g' is not defined, due to the scoping issue in get_pat_cols—nothing was generated, so outputs do not make sense or match expected filled grids.
 * Since no actual grid output was produced, can't compare to correct solution, but this error prevents any validation; expected test output should be a filled grid with patterns from singletons/stems, but instead it's unusable—likely the test has singletons and stems that would propagate fills, but code crash hides this.
 * The error is consistent across examples, indicating a fundamental code structure flaw rather than input-specific; fixing scope would allow checking if fills match (e.g., test probably expects specific diagonal-ish fills from top/bottom and horizontal from stems, but current offsets/colors may still mismatch subtly).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of cells with numbers representing colors (1-9) and 8 as blank/empty space, where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules driven by three unique colors (singletons) that appear exactly once each, using patterns like "stems" (runs of 1 or 2) to propagate fills horizontally or vertically in specific configurations. The puzzle emphasizes ordered placement of singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) into structured patterns (e.g., ascending vertical from bottom, descending horizontal from top, or horizontal extensions in middle), while preserving existing non-singleton runs and avoiding overwrites.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (sorted as s1, s2, s3); if not, no changes are made, but puzzles assume this condition holds.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (ascending pattern trigger) or 2 (descending pattern trigger) with length >=4; they prompt horizontal fills left/right from the stem cell at specific offsets (e.g., for 1: offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for 2: offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1]), but only into adjacent blank runs without overwriting non-blanks.
 * Singleton placement depends on row position: bottom row triggers upward vertical fill with pattern positions [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3]; top row triggers downward horizontal fill with [0,2,4] and [s3,s2,s1]; middle rows trigger simple horizontal extension left/right into blanks.
 * Fills must check boundaries (0 <= col < w) and avoid overwriting existing non-8/non-intended cells; patterns repeat vertically/horizontally until blocked.
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons are identified pre-fill, but post-fill counts may change implicitly.
 * Subtle: Horizontal fills from stems scan left/right blank runs fully but start from the offset position; vertical/horizontal patterns for singletons align to a "start_col" based on singleton's column minus its pattern offset.
 * Easy to miss: Order of operations matters—process stems first (modifies grid), then re-find singleton positions (may have changed), then place patterns; no diagonal or non-orthogonal fills.
 * Existing runs (e.g., long 3s, 6s, 9s) must not be overwritten unless part of a singleton pattern match.
 * Grid dimensions vary (h rows, w cols); assume rectangular, but code handles empty rows implicitly.
 * Potential for multiple singletons in same row/col, but placement avoids conflicts by checking "can_place" before filling.

            if cc in singletons:
                pos_dict[cc] = (i, j)
    return pos_dict
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 succeeded fully, correctly filling blanks with singleton patterns (e.g., vertical/horizontal extensions and stem propagations matched expected).
 * Training example 2 failed: generated output incorrectly filled row 2 with extra 9s (positions 7-13) where expected is blank; row 5 with 6s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 6 with 3s (7-26) but expected blanks; row 10 with extra 3s (18-26); row 11 with 2,1 but extra 8s misplaced; overall, over-filled horizontal runs from stems without respecting pattern offsets or boundaries, and singleton placements (e.g., 9s in row 0/1 col 17, 6/3 in col 19/21) mismatched expected sparse placements.
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected runs of 1/2), but offsets and color orders led to wrong horizontal fills (e.g., for c=1, used [1,3,5] but filled beyond intended blanks; for c=2, [0,3,l-2] caused asymmetric overwrites).
 * Singleton placement logic failed in middle/bottom cases: bottom vertical up filled too aggressively (e.g., row 11-17 with patterns repeating without boundary checks); top horizontal down didn't trigger correctly; middle extensions overwrote or under-filled (e.g., row 10 3s extended wrongly).
 * Counts and singletons identification worked (found 1,4,? but assumed 1,2,4 or similar; actual singletons seem 1,4,9? based on fills), but pos_dict post-stem was inaccurate due to grid mutations.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the left/right run scanning in stems (while le >0 and g[fr][le-1]==8) is buggy— it sets le incorrectly (starts at fc-1 then decrements while checking le-1, risking index errors or infinite loops if no blanks).
 * extract_objects not used or defined in this attempt, so irrelevant (don't introduce unless for segmenting runs).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it over-fills long horizontal runs (e.g., row 4 cols 6-28 with 6s, row 5 with 7s, row 11 with 9s cols 0-23 then 2,4) that appear to stem from misplaced pattern propagations, ignoring sparse expected placements; row 2 has 9s cols 6-15 and 3,2s cols 18-22, but likely should be more isolated based on singleton rules.
 * Singleton placements seem wrong: e.g., 1s in row 0 cols 4-5 and row 16 col 24 extended horizontally without pattern check; 4s scattered (row 1 col 4, row 3 col 19-23) don't align to ordered [s1,s2,s3] vertical/horizontal patterns from top/bottom.
 * Bottom section (rows 22-28) mirrors upper fills (e.g., 9s/6s/7s in row 24-26), suggesting duplicated stem processing without row-specific triggers; col 28 has isolated 7s/8s that break run continuity.
 * Overall, lacks subtlety of "can_place" checks—overwrites potential existing runs (e.g., row 7-10 blanks filled minimally, but row 12 6s col 24+ seem extraneous); does not match puzzle's sparse, pattern-driven fills seen in training 2 expected (e.g., single 9/6/3 in row 0/1).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (similar to a nonogram or pattern-filling challenge) where a partially filled grid with numbers 1-9 representing colors and 8s as blanks must be completed by identifying rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), using them to anchor and propagate specific vertical and horizontal patterns, and extending fills from "stems" (long vertical runs of 1s or 2s) into adjacent blank areas with ordered singleton colors. The goal is to fill blanks logically based on these structural rules without overfilling or missing propagations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons must exist (colors with count == 1); if not, return the grid unchanged—otherwise, sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use their positions to trigger patterns.
 * Top patterns (only if singleton at row 0) place a staggered horizontal triplet [s3, s2, s1] at columns offset by 0/2/4 from the singleton's column, then propagate downward vertically until non-blank cells block it; offsets ensure alignment, and partial triplets are invalid (must have all 3 columns in bounds).
 * Bottom patterns (only if singleton at last row) place a right-leaning or left-leaning triplet [s1, s2, s3] based on which singleton it is (s1: +0/+1/+3; s2: -1/+0/+3; s3: -3/-1/+0), then propagate upward vertically until blocked; again, must have exactly 3 valid columns.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) trigger simple horizontal extensions: fill left/right blanks in that row with the singleton's color until non-blanks.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s in a column; process only isolated stems (no adjacent columns with opposite stem type: 1s avoid adjacent 2-stem cols, and vice versa) by filling adjacent horizontal blank runs at specific row offsets within the stem: for type-1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] filled with [s1,s2,s3]; for type-2, offsets [0,3,len-2] filled with [s3,s2,s1]; fills extend left/right from the stem column until non-blanks.
 * Propagation stops at existing non-8 cells; never overwrite non-8s, only fill 8s.
 * Subtlety: Stem processing happens after singleton patterns, so it can fill areas created by prior propagations; however, stems must be detected on the updated grid post-singleton processing.
 * Order matters: Process singletons in sorted order [s1,s2,s3], but each can trigger independent top/bottom/middle actions; avoid double-filling by checking for 8 before placing.
 * Edge cases: Grids with h=0 or no singletons return unchanged; invalid pattern placements (e.g., out-of-bounds columns) are skipped; stems shorter than 4 are ignored.
 * Potential overfill risk: Horizontal extensions in stems or middles can chain across multiple blanks, but must stop at non-8s; vertical propagations check all pattern columns are blank before continuing.
 * Colors 1/2 are special for stems, but other colors (3-9) can be singletons or part of fills; blanks are strictly 8, and counts ignore 8s.
 * No diagonal or complex interactions; all fills are axis-aligned horizontal/vertical.

    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it implements a logical structure for singletons and stems but fails both training examples due to incorrect or overzealous filling.
 * Training example 1: Generated output incorrectly fills rows 10-15 with partial vertical patterns of 1,5,6 (e.g., row 10: [8,8,1,5,8,8,6,8,...] vs expected all 8s in those positions), likely from misapplied top/bottom patterns or early stem detection; also, row 18 has a 6 in column 18 where expected 8, and row 19 has 1s extended incorrectly; bottom sections (rows 20+) show mismatched horizontal fills (e.g., row 20 has 4,2,6s vs expected 4,2,6s but with different propagation); overall, overfills vertical blanks in the left-middle grid area without blocking properly.
 * Training example 1: Stem processing seems to miss isolation check or offset calculation, leading to unwanted fills in rows 16-17 (e.g., generated has 4,3s and 2s as expected, but upper fills differ); horizontal extensions in row 7-8 are correct, but singleton positions for 1,5,6 trigger invalid propagations.
 * Training example 2: Generated output fails to fill key horizontal extensions from stems, e.g., row 11 expected [8,8,...,4,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] but generated has 4,1,8s (missing 3s fill); row 12 has 2,1,8s vs expected 2,1,6s; row 13 2,1,8s vs 2,1,8s (partial match); row 14 2,1,8s vs 2,1,9s; this suggests broken stem isolation (fills adjacent despite adjacent opposite stems?) or wrong fill colors/offsets for type-2 stems; top sections (rows 0-8) match expected except row 3 (missing 6s horizontal fill).
 * Training example 2: Top/bottom patterns for singletons (likely 1,2,4 or similar) don't propagate correctly, e.g., row 3 generated has 1,2,8s but expected 6s across; middle horizontal extension in row 16-17 misses 3s in row 11.
 * Function `place_top_pattern` and `place_bottom_pattern` are partially helpful but buggy: they place triplets correctly in some cases (e.g., training 1 rows 7-8) but over-propagate vertically without proper all-columns-blank checks in some grids, leading to fills past blocks; the offset logic for top (4/2/0 based on sk) works for alignment but skips invalid starts correctly.
 * Function `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and seems correct (simple left/right fill until non-8), but underused if singletons aren't detected in middles.
 * Function `process_stems` is core but flawed: isolation check (no adjacent opposite-type stem cols) prevents some fills correctly but misses others (e.g., training 2 row 11 3s); offsets/fill_colors reverse for type-2 but calculation for [0,3,l-2] may go out-of-bounds or misalign for short stems; horizontal extension within stems works but doesn't chain to full rows if partial blanks.
 * Overall attempt shows good structure (singleton detection, stem finding) but errors in propagation logic (over/under-filling based on unblocked checks and isolation); no unhelpful functions per se, but `place_top_pattern`/`place_bottom_pattern` need stricter blocking, and stem processing needs better adjacent col handling.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar over/under-filling issues as training examples; for instance, it propagates 9s and 6s/7s horizontally in rows 2-5 (e.g., row 2: 9s across columns 6-15, then 3,2s) which may be from stem extensions, but row 2 expected likely has more structured fills from singletons (possibly 1,2,4 or similar) without such wide 9s if stems are isolated wrong.
 * Test fills upper-left with 1,4,2 patterns (rows 0-2) that seem plausible for top/middle singletons, but row 3 has 4,2 then 6s across (overfill? expected might limit 6s); lower sections (rows 11-15) show 9s wide then 2,4, but vertical 1,4 in row 16-17 suggests missed horizontal extension; bottom (rows 18+) has repeated 6,7,9 verticals without horizontal fills, likely missing stem processing for colors like 3,6,7,9.
 * Test output mismatches expected patterns by filling too many blanks vertically/horizontally without blocks (e.g., row 5: full 6s, row 6: full 7s, but these may be stems not isolated properly); singletons (e.g., 1 appears multiple times already, but counts would detect if exactly 3 uniques at 1); overall, it partially captures horizontal extensions (e.g., row 12 9s) but fails to match subtle offsets, making it incomplete and incorrect—likely needs better stem isolation and propagation checks to handle the test's wider grid and mixed stems.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (similar to a logic or pattern-completion puzzle like Fillomino or a variant of nonogram with color rules) where a partial grid with numbers representing colors (1,2,3,4,6,7,9) and blanks (8) must be completed by propagating fills based on detected patterns from unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (runs of 1 or 2 of length >=4). The goal is to fill blanks horizontally and vertically according to specific offset-based rules triggered by isolated stems and singleton positions at the top, bottom, or middle of the grid, ensuring no overfills or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors appearing once each); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent mapping (e.g., s1=1, s2=3, s3=6 in training example 2).
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) in a column, length >=4; only "isolated" stems (no overlapping adjacent stems of the opposite type in neighboring columns) trigger horizontal fills at specific row offsets: for type 1 stems, offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; for type 2, offsets [0,3,l-2] with [s3,s2,s1] (where l=stem length)—fills propagate left/right until non-blank or edge.
 * Top patterns (row 0 singletons): Trigger a 3-column pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c>=4: cols [c-4,c-3,c] with [s3,s2,s1]) and propagate downward while rows are all blank in those columns; partial fill starts at row 0.
 * Bottom patterns (row h-1 singletons): Similar but mirrored (e.g., for s1 at c: [c,c+1,c+4] with [s1,s2,s3]), propagate upward; partial fill at bottom row; anchors adjust for s2/s3 positions to fit left/right constraints.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom): Extend horizontally left/right from the singleton's position until non-blank or edge, but only in that row—no vertical propagation.
 * Order matters: Process stems first (as they may create or block patterns), then top patterns, bottom patterns, then middle extensions; avoid filling over existing non-blanks.
 * Subtleties: Patterns may not fill full height if blocked; stems must be exactly isolated (no vertical overlap with opposite-type adjacent stems); offsets can exceed grid height (skip invalid rows); colors like 4,6,7,9 may be pre-filled and influence isolation/blocking; horizontal fills stop at edges or non-8; singletons can be pre-filled in stems or patterns.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; singletons not in expected positions (e.g., too left for anchors) skip pattern placement; multiple singletons may trigger overlapping fills, but propagation checks for all-blank rows prevent conflicts.
 * Potential misses: Not handling partial vertical propagation correctly (e.g., stopping when a pattern row has a non-8); incorrect offset calculations for stems (e.g., l-2 may be invalid); assuming all singletons trigger patterns when only top/bottom do; not sorting singletons leading to color mismatches; stems of length exactly 4 may have offset l-2=2, which could overlap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly handled training example 1 (full match, likely simple top/bottom or stem case).
 * Failed training example 2: Generated incorrect horizontal fills from stems (e.g., row 3 left side unfilled as 8's, but expected 6's across cols 0-4; row 1 has 3's instead of expected 3's only partially? Wait, row 1 matches, but row 3 mismatch suggests wrong offset/color for a type-2 stem or isolation failure).
 * In training 2 generated vs expected: Lower section (rows ~10-17, cols ~16-18) shows repeated vertical 2/1/4 but no horizontal extensions or patterned fills (e.g., expected row 11 cols 18-26=3's, row 12=6's, row 14=9's from a bottom or middle pattern, but generated leaves them 8's—likely because place_bottom_pattern or extend_middle didn't trigger due to singleton positions not at exact bottom or incorrect anchor checks; also row 3 cols 0-4=8's vs expected 6's, indicating stem processing skipped or miscolored an isolated stem).
 * Stem processing worked partially (e.g., detected some verticals like col 16 1's and col 17 2's/4's), but isolation check or offset application failed for left-side stems.
 * Top/bottom pattern placement worked for upper parts (e.g., row 0/1 partial matches, row 5 9's match), but propagation stopped prematurely or didn't apply to lower singletons.
 * Middle extensions applied minimally (e.g., no horizontals from lower 1/2/4), suggesting pos_dict didn't capture them as middle or extend_middle only hit non-8 blocks immediately.
 * No overfills observed, but underfills dominate failures; count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions seem correct (identified singletons properly).
 * find_stems is helpful but may miss non-1/2 stems or short runs; is_isolated is essential but potentially too strict (e.g., if adjacent stems don't overlap vertically, it should pass—bug if it falsely rejects).
 * fill_horizontal is useful for propagation but doesn't handle vertical checks.
 * place_top_pattern and place_bottom_pattern are partially correct (anchor logic for s1/s2/s3 positions) but fail on propagation (e.g., checks all-blank but may not partial-fill correctly if singleton not blank).
 * extend_middle is broken/incomplete: Only horizontal from middle singletons, but expected shows vertical-like patterns (e.g., staggered horizontals at offsets), suggesting it needs to treat middle as mini-stems or patterns.
 * process_stems orders offsets/colors correctly for types but skips if offsets out-of-bounds; however, in training 2, it filled row 3 cols 14-22 as 4/2's correctly but missed left 6's—likely a separate stem not isolated.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct overall; it shows partial pattern fills (e.g., row 1: 9's in cols 4-7? Wait, row 0 has 1's at cols 4-5; row 1 9's cols 0-3 and 4=4? Inconsistent with singleton rules—singletons seem to be 1,3,4? But fills like row 2 9's cols 6-15 and 3's/2's/1's suggest top-pattern propagation from a row0 singleton, but colors mismatch expected s1/s2/s3 mapping).
 * Upper section: Row 4 full 6's cols 6-28 looks like a horizontal from stem offset, but row 5 full 7's suggests another, yet no vertical stems visible in input (test input not provided, but output implies over-propagation or wrong colors—7's may be pre-filled, but filling over?).
 * Lower section: Row 11 full 9's cols 0-23 then 2/4/7's staggered; row 12 6's cols 0-23 then 2/4; row 13 7's cols 0-23 then 2/4— this looks like bottom-pattern propagation upward, but staggered ends (e.g., 7's in row 12 col 28?) and row 24-28 mirroring upper suggest symmetric but incorrect color assignments (e.g., why 9's then 6's then 7's? Likely wrong s1/s2/s3 or offset misapplication; expected might stagger based on multiple singletons, but output fills too uniformly leftward).
 * Middle empties (rows 7-10, 16-23 all 8's) indicate missed middle extensions or no detected middle singletons (e.g., row 6 has 3's cols 4-5, but no horizontal spread).
 * No obvious overfills, but underfills in potential stem areas (e.g., col 4 has vertical 4/2/6/7/3/8..., suggesting a stem of mixed types not processed); output doesn't match puzzle logic as fills seem to ignore isolation (e.g., adjacent columns filled similarly without check).
 * Test has wider grid (29 cols?) with more pre-fills (e.g., row 2 has 9's and 3/2/1 clusters), implying complex interactions—output partially captures vertical propagation (e.g., row 4-5 horizontals) but fails on horizontal offsets from lower singletons (e.g., row 24 has 1's/4/2/9's but no full lines).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for simple top/bottom but not for intertwined stems/singletons—likely inherits training 2 bugs (e.g., no patterned horizontals in lower right).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (value 8) are populated with colors (integers 1-9) based on rules involving three unique singletons (colors appearing exactly once), horizontal extensions from them, and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2) that trigger patterned fills either in isolation or when adjacent. The goal is to propagate fills downward/upward or sideways from these elements while respecting existing colors and avoiding overwrites unless matching.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (s1 < s2 < s3) must exist initially; if not, no fills occur—subtlety: counts exclude blanks (8), and singletons are sorted.
 * Top patterns: If a singleton is at row 0, it seeds a repeating horizontal triplet pattern (e.g., for s1 at col c: fills s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c, downward until mismatch), but only if columns are valid and cells are blank or match; patterns shift based on which singleton (s1/s2/s3) is the anchor.
 * Bottom patterns: Similar to top but upward from row h-1, with different column offsets (e.g., for s1 at bottom: s1 at c, s2 at c+1, s3 at c+4) and reversed direction.
 * Middle extensions: For non-edge singletons, fill horizontal runs of blanks left/right from the singleton's position with its color—subtlety: this is simple flood-fill but stops at non-blanks.
 * Stems: Vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s or 2s (type=1 or 2); processed after other steps, so stems can form dynamically.
 * Adjacent stems: If two stems of opposite types (1 and 2) are in neighboring columns and overlap >=3 rows, fill away from the longer/shorter one in the overlap at offsets [0,1,ol_len//2] with s1/s2/s3 (reversed for type 2), direction based on relative column position—subtlety: only if the current stem's length >= adjacent's; fills stop at non-blanks.
 * Isolated stems: For type 1, fill at offsets [1,3,5] with s1/s2/s3 horizontally both directions; for type 2, offsets [0, length//2, length-2] with s3/s2/s1—subtlety: for type 2 at offset 0, additional downward fills in the next row based on horizontal reach (e.g., if right side reaches a filled cell, fill below the blanks to that point, and mirror opposites).
 * Order matters: Top/bottom/middle first, then stems (stems may use prior fills); no overwrites unless matching; grid is mutable copy.
 * Subtle elements: Patterns don't wrap edges; fills are row-by-row until break on mismatch; isolated type 2 has complex "reached" logic for next-row mirroring (e.g., fill below reached segments and set opposites); adjacent fills are only in overlap and away direction; potential for stems to be created by prior fills.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns as-is; singletons not at edges skip top/bottom; short overlaps (<3) skip adjacent processing; offsets may exceed length, so unique/sorted handling; type 2 offset 0 special fill checks existing fills in current row to determine next-row propagation.
 * General: Colors seem thematic (1/2 stems, 3-7 fills, 9 sometimes appears but not in singletons here); no diagonal or other interactions; all fills are horizontal or vertical-aligned to anchors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single attempt provided) correctly identifies singletons via counting non-blanks and positions them, which works for seeding patterns if they exist at edges.
 * Top/bottom pattern processing works partially: in train1, it fills some downward/upward triplets (e.g., generated has 2,3 in row3 col18-19 matching expected, and 2,4 in row6), but fails on specifics like row2 col17-19 (generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3? wait, minor; actually row3 generated 2,3 vs expected 2,3, but row2 generated 2,4 vs expected 2,4—discrepancy in presentation but seems partial match; however, overfills or misses in lower sections).
 * Middle extensions work for horizontal fills from non-edge singletons, but in train1, it doesn't appear to trigger much (e.g., singleton 1 at row10 col2 extends? but generated doesn't show full horizontals).
 * Stem finding is helpful and detects long vertical 1/2 runs, but processing fails: in train1, isolated stems like bottom 1-stem and 2-stem get partial horizontal fills (e.g., row16-17 has 4,3,3,3,3,4 and 2,2,2,2,2,2,4 matching expected), but type2 offset0 special downward mirroring is broken (e.g., row18 has 8,1,5 vs expected 8,1,5—minor, but later rows like row20 has 4,2,6,6,6,6,6 vs expected 4,2,6,6,6,6,6; actually mismatches in row21: generated 4,2,6 vs expected 3,2,8—wrong color s1=1 vs s3=3?); adjacent stems not handled well (train1 has no clear adjacents, but overfills elsewhere).
 * In train2, singletons (1,3,6?) processed poorly: top/bottom patterns miss (e.g., generated fills 1,2 vertical but expected has more 3/6 extensions); stems like left 3/6/9 verticals get no fills, while right 1/2/4 get partial but wrong (row11 generated 2,1,3,3,3,... vs expected 4,1,3,3,3—wrong starting color); isolated stem logic applies incorrectly, leading to extra 1/2 fills in empty areas.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of structure (singletons + stems) but bugs in pattern offsets (e.g., bottom pat_cols for s3 wrong?), adjacent overlap calc (skips valid?), and type2 special fill (reach detection flawed, e.g., temp_j unused, mirroring opposites incorrectly sets non-singleton colors); no handling for post-fill stem recreation (runs after all processes?); unhelpful: process_stems has redundant direction code for adjacent (if step==-1 repeated); the whole adjacent block skips if length < other_len but doesn't swap perspective.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills and mismatches expected patterns based on mental simulation of rules.
 * Singletons likely 1,2,4 (appear once: 1 at row0 col4-5? wait input has two 1s? wait, input row0 has two 1s, but counts would see multiples—program returns early if !=3 singletons, but generated fills anyway? Bug: perhaps counts wrong or fills ignore check.
 * Top patterns should seed from potential top singleton (e.g., if 1 at row0 col4, but duplicates; mental: no clear top singleton, so minimal top fills; generated has row1 4,1 but input already has, then row2 4,2,9...—seems partial match but adds 9s wrongly.
 * Stems: Clear type2 stem at col5 rows0-6 (1? wait input has 1,1 at row0 col4-5, but 2 at row2-4 col5? Mixed; long 7-stem? No, stems only 1/2; generated ignores, fills unrelated 9/7 elsewhere (e.g., row2 has 9s extended wrongly from input 9s).
 * Bottom/middle: Input has bottom-ish 6/7/9, but generated adds 1,4 at row15-16 wrongly; horizontal extensions from 2/4 at row14-15 partial but adds extra 7s.
 * Adjacent stems missing: Potential col4 (3s short) and col5 (2s) not adjacent properly; generated row25-28 has 4,2,9/7 but expected likely mirrors from type2 offset0 (downward from row4 col5 2, but input sparse).
 * Overall, fills like row12 9s extended left/right from input but shouldn't (not singleton/stem triggered); test has more colors (7,9) not in singletons, so rules may need generalization beyond s1/s2/s3 for fills—program assumes only s1-3 colors, leading to blanks remaining or wrong propagation; does not make sense as it creates inconsistent patterns (e.g., isolated 7-stem in row4 not processed as stem since !=1/2).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are filled with colors (numbers like 1-7,9) based on "singleton" seeds (colors appearing exactly once) that trigger specific multi-column patterns at the top or bottom of the grid, propagating vertically until blocked, while middle singletons extend horizontally; additionally, vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s) trigger horizontal fills at fixed offsets using the singletons, with the goal of completing symmetric or patterned structures across the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must appear exactly 3 times in total across the initial grid (s1, s2, s3, sorted by value); if not exactly 3, no filling occurs—easy to miss if counts include post-fill updates.
 * Top singletons (row 0) trigger a specific 3-column pattern with offsets [0,2,3] and colors assigned as [s3,s2,s1], starting from the singleton's column minus its offset, propagating downward row-by-row only if all 3 columns are blank in that row.
 * Bottom singletons (row h-1) trigger a mirrored 3-column pattern with offsets [0,1,4] and colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward similarly, but only if the starting columns fit within grid width.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right along their row until non-blanks are hit, without vertical propagation—subtle that this doesn't trigger the full pattern.
 * Stems are vertical runs of at least length 4 of either 1 (type 1, fills at offsets [1,3,5] with [s1,s2,s3]) or 2 (type 2, fills at offsets [0,3,l-2] where l=stem length, with [s3,s2,s1]); fills extend horizontally left/right from the stem column at those exact row offsets, but only into blanks—easy to miss bounds checking (e.g., offsets exceeding stem length or grid height).
 * Propagation stops at any non-blank cell in the pattern columns; stems are detected after singleton processing, so order matters—subtle interactions if singletons create or block stems.
 * Grid may have pre-filled colors (e.g., 3,4,5,6,7,9) that act as barriers or hints; blanks are strictly 8s, and counts ignore 8s.
 * Patterns seem symmetric or repeating vertically in some cases (e.g., train1 expected has repeating 1-5-6 vertical lines), suggesting possible secondary rules for vertical extensions beyond singletons/stems, like mirroring or periodic fills triggered by nearby patterns—missed in code.
 * Width/height vary (e.g., 29 cols in train1, 27 in train2), so patterns must adapt; colors like 9 may be special (e.g., not singletons, but fillable horizontally/vertically).
 * No overwriting of non-8s; if a pattern hits a pre-fill, it stops without filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly identified singletons (e.g., in train1, s1=1,s2=2,s3=3) and their positions, enabling basic pattern triggering.
 * Successfully filled some top/bottom 3-column propagations (e.g., train1 top with 2-3-4? but mismatched colors; bottom with 2-3-1 correctly in parts).
 * Handled horizontal extensions for middle singletons (e.g., train1 row7 col1=2 extended right, but incomplete).
 * Detected and partially filled stems (e.g., train1 bottom stem of 1s filled horizontals with 3-2-1/5, matching expected in rows 20-24; train2 filled some 2-stem horizontals with 2-1-9/6/3).
 * Train1 generated some correct barrier-respecting fills (e.g., row1 cols0-17=6s, row5=5s, row6=1s) but failed to fill vertical repeating patterns in cols2,3,6 (expected 1-5-6 cycle from row9-25, but generated only isolated or wrong values like row9 col2=1 but no propagation).
 * Train1 mismatched bottom pattern colors/offsets (generated row19 col23=4,2,6 but expected 4,2,6; but missed verticals entirely in middle).
 * Train2 overfilled 9s horizontally/vertically (e.g., row2 cols7-13=9s, row5 cols0-4=9s, but expected sparse 9s only in row2 cols14-20 and row14 cols18-26), suggesting broken 9-handling or false stem detection.
 * Train2 missed key vertical fills (e.g., expected col21=3s in rows0-1, but generated nothing; col5=1s and col6=2/4/6/3 sparse but incomplete).
 * Stem filling in both used fixed singleton colors but ignored dynamic adaptation (e.g., train1 stem type2 used [s3,s2,s1]=3-2-1 correctly for bottom, but offsets [0,3,l-2] caused partial fills if l varies).
 * No vertical propagation beyond singletons (e.g., train1 expected rows9-25 col2=1s repeating, but code only horizontals); middle singletons not triggering verticals.
 * Hardcoded top/bottom patterns worked for simple cases but failed bounds (e.g., train2 top singleton at col5=1 triggered but offsets pushed out of bounds, leading to no fill).
 * Function `program` overall structure (singletons first, then stems) is helpful but incomplete—stems after singletons is correct order, but lacks rules for non-singleton colors like 9,7,6,5,4,3 propagating.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but stem offsets for type2 using l-2 is subtle and worked in parts; count_non_blanks is essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (e.g., filled horizontal lines from apparent stems like row4 cols4-28=6s, row5=7s matching potential type1/2 fills; bottom row23-26 horizontals with 9s/6s/7s from col9 stem) but does not look fully correct—misses vertical propagations (e.g., col4 seems to have 4-2-6-7 vertically from row1-5, but no further down or repeating like expected patterns in trains; col24 has 3-2-1-4 sparse but no full verticals).
 * Overfills some areas (e.g., row11 cols0-23=9s, row2 cols6-17=9s, but test input has sparse 9s/3/1/2, suggesting false pattern trigger; row2 col18-22=3-2-2-2-1 but code filled 3-4-4-4-4-1, mismatching expected horizontal from stem?).
 * Missing key middle fills (e.g., row10 cols24-28=3-3-8-8-8 but input has 3s there, no extension; row16 col24=1 but no horizontal or vertical repeat; bottom row27 col9=4-2 but no upward propagation).
 * Fails to handle potential new singletons (input has 1s at row0 col4-5, row2 col23-24, row16 col24—more than 3? Code assumes exactly 3, so skipped many; also 7s in row5 may be stem but filled oddly).
 * Overall, test output covers ~40% of expected fills (guessing from pattern similarity to trains) but ignores vertical repeats/subtleties like 9/7 as barriers or secondary seeds, leading to incomplete grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a partially filled grid (where 8 represents blanks and 1-9 are colors) that must be completed by propagating fills based on unique "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2). The rules emphasize pattern matching around singletons at edges or middles, and directional filling from stems, with interactions between paired stems.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * There must be exactly 3 singletons (colors appearing once); if not, no fills occur—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Top/bottom patterns are anchor triplets of columns with specific color orders (e.g., for top, if singleton sk is s1, pattern is s3 at c-4, s2 at c-2, s1 at c; propagate vertically down/up if compatible).
 * Middle singletons trigger horizontal extensions to fill adjacent blanks in the same row.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (type 1, "top-heavy") or 2 (type 2, "bottom-heavy") of length >=4; fills from stems use fixed offsets (e.g., for type 1: s1 at +1, s2 at +3, s3 at +5; for type 2: s3 at 0, s2 at +3, s1 at ln-2 if ln>=6) and propagate horizontally in directions (-1 and/or +1) based on partner stems (opposite type, adjacent column, overlapping rows).
 * Partner stems block filling toward them; if no partners or unpaired sides, fill both directions; if length > partner length, fill away from partners.
 * Propagation only fills if cells are 8 or match the color; stop if conflict.
 * Subtle: Stem fills are row-specific offsets from start, and only if offset < length; directions are determined by unpaired sides (away from partners); runs must be contiguous same color.
 * Counts exclude blanks (8); positions are exact for singletons.
 * Order matters: Process singletons first (top/bottom/middle), then stems on updated grid.
 * Easy to miss: For type 2 stems, s1 offset is ln-2 only if ln>=6; patterns must fit within width (0 to w-1); no diagonal or other fills.
 * If singletons not at edges/middles, or stems <4, limited propagation.
 * Potential overfill: Horizontal stem propagation can chain if blanks are adjacent, but must check compatibility each step.
 * Underfill risk: If partners overlap but don't block correctly, or if stem length condition fails.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * get_top_pattern and get_bottom_pattern: Seem correct but may have wrong column offsets or color orders for some cases, leading to invalid patterns (e.g., out-of-bounds or mismatches in training 1).
 * extend_middle_horizontal: Works for basics but overfills if not checked against existing colors, causing extras in training 1.
 * Overall program: Stem partner logic under-detects overlaps or miscalculates directions, leading to underfills (e.g., training 2 misses horizontal fills like 3s/6s/9s next to singletons).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; both training examples failed due to incorrect fills from stems and patterns.
 * Training 1: Generated overfills left columns (e.g., rows 10-15 have [1,1,1,5,...] and [5,5,1,5,...] where expected has all 8s; also extra 1/5/6 in rows 18-25); correctly identified some right-side patterns (e.g., row 19 4s, row 20 4,2,6s) but propagated too aggressively from middle singletons or stems.
 * Training 1: Stem fills likely triggered horizontal chains incorrectly, filling blanks that should remain 8 (unknown why, perhaps no partner check or wrong offsets); top/bottom patterns partially worked (e.g., row 0 4s, row 1 2,4 correct) but didn't propagate fully.
 * Training 2: Generated underfills key areas (e.g., row 11 has 4,1,8s... where expected has 4,1,3s...; row 12 has 2,1,8s where expected 2,1,6s; row 14 has 2,1,8s where expected 2,1,9s); missed horizontal propagations from stems or patterns near singletons (e.g., 1 at col5 triggers but doesn't fill adjacent colors like 3/6/9).
 * Training 2: Singleton positions correct (e.g., 1 spans multiple rows in col5), but stem detection or do_stem_fills failed to apply offsets/directions properly, leaving blanks; no overfills, suggesting conservative propagation.
 * General: Assumes exactly 3 singletons, which holds but fails if counts change mid-process; stem partners not blocking correctly (e.g., in train1, unpaired stems fill both sides, causing extras); order of processing (singletons then stems) is good but needs iteration if new singletons emerge (not handled).
 * find_stems is helpful but may detect partial runs if grid updates mid-way (runs on copy, but propagation before stems helps).
 * count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions are essential and correct, as they accurately identify s1/s2/s3 and positions.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (e.g., horizontal fills from apparent stems like row5 all 7s, row11 all 9s up to 2,4,7s; vertical propagations in col24 like 2,4 down to row15) but looks incorrect overall, as it leaves many blanks unfilled where patterns suggest more (e.g., singleton 1 at row0 col4 should trigger top/middle patterns, but col0-3 remain 8s in row0; row2 has 3,2,2s but no further horizontal from 2-stem?).
 * Missing fills: No propagation from bottom singletons (e.g., row16 col24 1,4 doesn't extend up/down fully; row25-28 have scattered 4,2,9s/7s but expected denser patterns based on stems in col9-10); underfills around col20-21 6,7 (only vertical, no horizontal from offsets).
 * Extra fills: Row12 all 9s seems over-aggressive (if from type2 stem offset 0=s3=9?, but chains too far without bounds check); row2 9s propagate right but stop abruptly at col18, possibly missing partner logic.
 * Does not look fully correct: Training failures suggest stem directions/offsets are buggy, so test likely misses key horizontal fills (e.g., from 3-stem in col4 rows6-7? should fill s1/s2/s3 horizontally); vertical 7s in row5 and col28 suggest stem detection works, but incomplete (e.g., no fills in row6-7 col4 from type1? offsets).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-filling puzzle where blank cells (8s) are completed based on patterns derived from rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once) and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1s or 2s), with rules for top/bottom patterns, horizontal extensions, and isolated stem extensions using the singletons. The goal is to propagate fills logically without overfilling, ensuring the output matches the expected completed grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Singletons must be exactly three unique colors with count 1 each; sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 and use them to fill patterns—failure to identify or sort correctly leads to no fills or wrong colors.
 * Top patterns trigger only if a singleton is in row 0; they check/fill specific column offsets (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c-4,c-2,c with colors s3,s2,s1) starting from row 0 and propagate down while blanks align, but stop if mismatch.
 * Bottom patterns trigger if singleton in last row; similar offset-based fills (e.g., for s1 at col c: cols c,c+1,c+4 with s1,s2,s3) but propagate upward from near-bottom, stopping on mismatch—offsets differ from top and seem asymmetric/irregular.
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom row) extend horizontally left/right from their position with their own color until non-blank.
 * Stems are vertical runs of 1 (type 1) or 2 (type 2) of length >=4 in a column; only process if "isolated" (no adjacent column with overlapping opposite-type stem of equal or longer length).
 * For isolated stems, extend horizontally from specific row offsets within the stem: for type 1, offsets 1(s1),3(s2),5(s3); for type 2, offsets 0(s3),3(s2),len-2(s1); extend left/right until non-blank—subtle: offsets must be < length, and row = start_row + offset must be valid.
 * Process order matters: top/bottom first, then middle extensions, then stems (using updated grid for stem detection)—overfills happen if stems extend into already-filled areas incorrectly.
 * Blanks (8) are fillable only if matching pattern; non-8 cells block propagation.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 29 cols in train 1, variable height); validate column indices to avoid index errors.
 * Subtle asymmetry in bottom patterns (e.g., irregular offsets like c+1 for s1) and stem offsets suggests puzzle-specific rules, possibly visual (e.g., mimicking shapes like arrows or trees).
 * Counts exclude 8s; singletons from sorted keys with count==1—easy to miss if other colors have count 1 but aren't used.
 * Isolation check for stems: only adjacent cols (abs(oc - c)==1), opposite type, and overlap (max(starts) < min(ends)) with opp length >= this length—miss this and stems over-extend.
 * No fills if <3 singletons; copy input otherwise.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it failed on Training example 1 by overfilling left-side areas (e.g., row 10 filled [1,1,1,...] instead of [8,8,1,...]; rows 11-15 filled vertical 1s and 5s incorrectly where expected has all 8s except specific positions).
 * Succeeded on Training example 2, correctly handling its patterns (likely due to different singleton positions and stems not triggering overfills).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially in train 1 (e.g., matched rows 0-9 and 16-26), but stem processing caused overfills, suggesting isolation check or offset logic failed (e.g., processed non-isolated stems or wrong offsets).
 * Middle extensions seemed correct (no obvious mismatches there).
 * Stem detection via find_stems is helpful but process_stem over-applied fills, possibly because it used the updated grid after prior steps, leading to unintended propagations.
 * Bottom pattern offsets appear buggy or asymmetric (e.g., for s1: c,c+1,c+4 seems off, causing partial mismatches in train 1 row 26).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but process_top_pattern and process_bottom_pattern could be refined for stricter mismatch stopping; extend_middle_horizontal is simple and likely correct.
 * count_non_blanks and find_singleton_positions are essential and worked (correctly identified s1=1,s2=5,s3=6 in train 1).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills patterns (e.g., horizontal extensions in rows 1-2,11-14 for colors like 9,6,7; vertical stems in cols 21-22 filled with 6,7; some singleton-based fills like row 25 with 3,3), which seems logically consistent with the rules but may overfill or miss subtleties.
 * It does not look fully correct: e.g., row 0 has [8,8,8,8,1,1,8,...] but input has 1 at col4, so middle extension should fill horizontally from there, but output only shows two 1s—possibly incomplete; row 2 has 9s extended but stops abruptly, and row 25 has 2,4 but input has no clear trigger there.
 * Bottom-area fills (rows 18-29) show repeated 6,7,9 but sparse, suggesting stem extensions happened but perhaps missed isolation (e.g., col21 has long 6 run, col22 7, adjacent opposites—should not extend if overlapping >= length).
 * Overall, it makes partial sense (captures some top/middle/stem logic) but likely incorrect due to same issues as train 1 (over/under-filling stems), e.g., row 29 has 3,3 at end but input has none, unexplained; needs better isolation/offset handling for test's complex layout (multiple stems, singletons at 1,2,3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle similar to a nonogram or pattern-propagation challenge, where a partially filled grid (with numbers 1-9 as colors and 8 as blanks) must be completed by identifying three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each), detecting vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2), and applying specific filling rules like horizontal extensions, vertical propagations from top/bottom singletons, and isolated stem patterns to propagate colors logically without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires exactly three singletons (colors with count==1); if not, no filling occurs—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Vertical stems are runs of the same value (1 or 2) of length >=4 in a column; type 1 stems (value=1) and type 2 (value=2) have opposite behaviors, with isolation checked against adjacent columns (c-1 or c+1) for opposite-type stems of equal or longer length that overlap vertically.
 * For isolated stems, fill horizontals at specific row offsets: type 1 uses offsets [1,3,5] with colors [s1,s2,s3]; type 2 uses [0,3,length-2] with [s3,s2,s1]; extend left/right from the stem column until non-blank or edge.
 * Subtlety for type 1 stems: Check for a left-prefix (adjacent left column with >=2 consistent non-stem/non-blank cells); if present, fill an extra row (offset=2) rightward with s1 and set the left cell to the prefix color if it's blank/stem.
 * Top-row singletons (r==0) trigger diagonal-ish patterns: depending on which singleton (s1/s2/s3), select column offsets like [-4,-2,0] for s1, and propagate downward only if all pattern columns are blank or match the color in each row.
 * Bottom-row singletons (r==h-1) use asymmetric patterns: e.g., for s1 [0,1,4], propagate upward similarly, but offsets are irregular (e.g., negative for s3).
 * Middle singletons (not top/bottom) only extend horizontally left/right with their color until non-blank.
 * Propagation stops if a row can't be fully matched (any pattern column out-of-bounds or non-matching non-blank).
 * Subtle: Stem processing happens before singleton patterns, so it can pre-fill areas that affect later propagations; avoid overfilling by checking for 8 only.
 * Grids can be tall/narrow (e.g., 21x27 or 29 cols in test); ensure bounds checks (0 <= j < w).
 * No diagonal or complex interactions beyond stems/singletons; unfilled areas remain 8.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for top/bottom are color-ordered differently (top: [s3,s2,s1], bottom: [s1,s2,s3]); isolation requires no vertical overlap with qualifying opposite stems.

(Note: Similar propagate_bottom_pattern exists but propagates upward; process_stem_fills handles isolated stem horizontal fills with offsets and left-prefix logic; extend_middle_horizontal does simple left/right extension. These are all helpful for core logic but may need tweaks for overfilling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly handled Training example 1 by properly identifying singletons (e.g., assuming 3,6,9), stems, and propagations to fill the full expected grid without errors.
 * Failed on Training example 2: Generated output overfilled horizontals in the bottom section—e.g., row 10 (0-indexed) has 4,1 followed by nine 3's extending right to col26, but expected has only 4,1 and blanks after (no 3's); row 11 has 4,1,3's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks; row 12 has 2,1, six 6's in generated but expected has 2,1 and blanks before six 6's? Wait, parsing shows generated extended 3's and misplaced 2's/4's in rows 10-18, likely due to incorrect stem isolation or offset filling in process_stem_fills allowing overlaps or wrong colors (e.g., s1=3? assuming singletons 1,3,6 or similar, but code sorted s1<s2<s3 and applied [s1,s2,s3] wrongly).
 * Stem processing pre-fills interfered with singleton patterns, causing extra fills in non-isolated areas (e.g., generated row 2 has extra 1's and 4's not in expected? No, row 2 matches, but bottom mismatches suggest non-isolated stems were processed anyway).
 * Top/bottom patterns worked partially (e.g., top fills like row0-1 3's and row3 6's match), but middle/bottom horizontals overextended (e.g., generated row14 has nine 9's, expected matches, but adjacent rows don't).
 * Function is_isolated seems correct but may miss subtle overlaps; process_stem_fills' left-prefix logic might trigger falsely, filling extras (unknown why in this case).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but propagate functions could be stricter on "can_fill" to prevent partial matches.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It identifies singletons (likely 1,3,9 or similar, given fills) and applies some stem fills (e.g., row4-5 wide 6's and 7's from a type2 stem?), top/bottom patterns (e.g., row1-2 9's and 3's propagating down, row25-28 9's/6's/7's from bottom), and horizontals (e.g., row11 wide 9's), but overfills inconsistently—e.g., row2 has 9's then 3's/2's/1's clumped awkwardly without clear pattern match, row16 has 1,4 but no further propagation upward despite bottom rules; row7-10 are mostly blank but should propagate from nearby stems/singletons (e.g., col4 has 3's in row6 but no extension); row23-24 have isolated 1's/4's/2's without horizontal extension, suggesting missed middle singleton rule or bounds issues in wider 29-col grid; overall, it fills ~60% logically but leaves gaps (e.g., row6 3's not extended) and adds extras (e.g., row12 wide 9's may overstep isolation), so rules like stem offsets or pattern cols need adjustment for asymmetric grids.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill blank cells (8s) with colors (1-9) based on patterns seeded by exactly three singleton colors (appearing once each), which propagate horizontally and vertically, while interacting with vertical "stems" (runs of 1s or 2s at least 4 cells long) to extend fills in specific directions and offsets. The puzzle relies on relative positioning of singletons and stems, with rules for top/bottom/middle placements, stem types (1 vs. 2), pairing checks to avoid overfilling, and conditional propagation based on adjacent filled cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singletons (sorted as s1 < s2 < s3) must exist; if not, no filling occurs—easy to miss edge cases where counts change mid-process due to prior fills.
 * Top patterns (if singleton in row 0) use every-other-column spacing (e.g., c, c+2, c+4 for s1 at c) with colors [s1,s2,s3] or reversed variants, propagating downward only if compatible (blanks or matching colors).
 * Bottom patterns (if singleton in last row) use irregular spacing (e.g., c, c+1, c+3 for s1) with colors [s1,s2,s3], propagating upward with similar compatibility checks—subtle asymmetry in column offsets vs. top.
 * Middle singletons (not edges) extend horizontally left/right through contiguous blanks with the singleton's color, but only in that row—no vertical propagation here.
 * Stems are vertical runs of uniform 1 or 2 (type=cl) >=4 long; process after singletons to avoid interference.
 * Type 1 stems (color 1): Fill unpaired sides (left/right if no adjacent type 2 stem overlaps in rows) at offsets 1,3,5 from start with s1,s2,s3 horizontally—subtle: offsets must be < length, and "paired" checks row overlap strictly (max(start) < min(end)).
 * Type 2 stems (color 2): Only if isolated (no adjacent type 1 overlapping); for each side, count contiguous horizontal blanks at offset 0, check if ends with s3; fill offset 0 with s3 up to that count, s2 at offsets [3] or [3, length-2] if ends with s3, s1 at (length-1) or (length-2)—easy to miss: fills are horizontal from stem column, and s2 has conditional extra offset based on s3 adjacency.
 * Propagation stops if incompatible (out of bounds or mismatch); all fills overwrite only 8s, preserve existing colors.
 * Order matters: Singletons first (top/bottom/middle), then stems—mid-process fills can create new stems or change counts, but code copies grid and counts initial non-blanks only.
 * Subtle: Patterns assume sorted singletons, but placement depends on which singleton (sk) is at the position; column checks prevent out-of-bounds.
 * No diagonal or other interactions; colors beyond singletons (e.g., multiples of 3-7,9) are treated as fixed clues.
 * Potential overfill risk: Stem fills might overlap singleton propagations, but compatibility checks mitigate.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it correctly identifies singletons and processes top/bottom/middle patterns, as seen in train2 succeeding fully.
 * For train1 (incorrect): Generated output filled left-side stems and some right-side horizontals (e.g., rows 0-6 match expected with 1,5,6 patterns), but failed to fill vertical propagations on the right (e.g., rows 10-15 have many 8s where expected has vertical 1,5,6 repeating; row 17 has 8,1,5,8,8,6 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6—wait, similar but row 18 has 8,1,5,8,6,1,1,1 vs. expected 8,1,5,8,8,6 with later fills; row 23 has 8,1,5,8,8,6,8,1,5 vs. expected with 5s; row 24 has 1s at end vs. expected 1s but positioned differently)—likely due to type2 stem processing not triggering extra s2 offsets or s1 placement correctly, leaving blanks; also, row 22 has 3,2,5,5,5,5,5 vs. expected 3,2,1,1,1,1,1 (mismatch in vertical fill at bottom-right).
 * Train1 also overfilled or mismatched in bottom-right (e.g., row 20: 3,2,8s vs. expected 3,2,8s—matches, but propagation stopped early); unknown why vertical singleton patterns (e.g., from row9 col2=1) didn't propagate fully downward like in expected.
 * Stem processing order/issues: Type1 fills happened, but type2 isolation check or condition for extra s2_off (based on s3 adjacency) failed, preventing full right-side fills; paired check for type1 might have wrongly skipped a side.
 * Middle horizontal extension worked partially (e.g., row8 2s extended), but didn't interact well with stems.
 * Function `get_top_pattern` and `get_bottom_pattern` are helpful but subtle—bottom has non-symmetric offsets (c+1,c+3 vs. top's even spacing), which may cause misalignment in irregular grids.
 * Function `process_type1_stem` is mostly correct but misses if stem length <5 (skips s3), which happened in train1 (length=6? but offsets up to5).
 * Function `process_type2_stem` is broken/incomplete: Fills s3 at offset0 correctly in some cases, but s2_offs logic ( [3] or [3,length-2] if condition) and s1_off (length-1 or -2) didn't trigger extra fills in train1 right-side, leaving verticals blank; also, fills s3 horizontally but code has fill_stem_direction which is horizontal—wait, it's correct but condition= s3 at next_cc may not detect properly if s3 is from prior fill.
 * `extend_middle_horizontal` is helpful and worked (e.g., singleton 4 in row7 extended), but limited to single row.
 * Overall, attempt understands singleton seeding and basic propagation but underfills complex stem interactions, especially type2 conditionals and vertical chaining.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly identified singletons (likely 1,2,3 or similar, but grid has 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 visible), filled top-left patterns (e.g., row0-1 has 1s at col4-5, row2 has 2,9s), vertical stems (e.g., row4-5 full 6s and 7s), bottom patterns (row11 full 9s with 2,4,7), and some middle extensions (row12-15 2,4 with verticals); right-side has partial 6,7,9 in rows17-28, suggesting type1/2 stem processing from col21-22.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Many 8s remain (e.g., rows6-10 almost empty except col4-5 3s; row16 has 1,4 but no extension; rows17-28 have sparse 6,7,9 at col21-22 but no horizontal fills from stems or singleton propagation—e.g., no s1/s2/s3 offsets visible); left-bottom (row28 col9-10 3s) seems isolated without propagation; unknown singletons but assuming 1,2,3, top singleton at row0 col4=1 should propagate [1,?,?] down col4,5,? but row2 col5=2, row3 col5=1 mismatch? Wait, perhaps s1=1,s2=2,s3=3, but bottom row11 has 2,4,7 which doesn't match pattern; likely type2 stem at col5 (2s in row2-5?) didn't fill horizontals properly to right (e.g., no 3,4 extensions beyond); right-side verticals (6,7,9) seem like fixed clues, not propagated from singletons—output underfills connections between left stems and right blanks.
 * Test output misses full propagation: E.g., if singleton 1 at row15 col24, middle horizontal should fill row15 blanks around col24 with 1s, but it's 1,4—no extension left/right; bottom singleton? (none obvious) didn't trigger upward fills; stem at col4 (4,2,6,7,3?) isn't uniform 1/2, so no processing, leaving gaps.
 * To handle test: Need better stem detection post-all fills (code does single pass), recount singletons after initial propagations, and fix type2 condition to detect s3 from clues (not just blanks).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers 1-9) and blanks (8), where the goal is to fill blanks according to rules centered on three unique singleton colors (appearing exactly once each) and vertical "stems" (long runs of 1 or 2). The filling uses patterned horizontal extensions from stems and vertical propagations from singletons at edges, with the program attempting to automate this logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * There must be exactly 3 singleton colors (colors appearing once); if not, no filling occurs beyond copying the input—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent ordering in patterns.
 * Stems are vertical runs of the same value (1 or 2 only) of length >=4 in a column; type is the value (1 or 2), and they can be isolated (no adjacent overlapping stem of the opposite type in neighboring column) or paired (adjacent column has opposite type with row overlap).
 * For isolated stems: Fill horizontal blanks to left and right at specific row offsets from stem start (for type 1: offsets 1,3,5 with colors s1,s2,s3; for type 2: offsets 0,3,length-2 with s3,s2,s1); fill extends across consecutive blanks in the direction until non-blank.
 * For paired stems: Only fill on the "away" side (direction opposite the pair) using the same offsets/colors as isolated; if the longer stem determines processing, use its length for offsets.
 * Special rule in process_stem_side for type 2 at offset 0: If a horizontal run of blanks exists and the cell immediately after the run in the direction is s3, fill the row below the run span with s3 (but only if downward and within bounds).
 * Singleton positions: If at top row (row 0), apply top pattern (3-column offset based on which singleton k is: e.g., for k=s1, columns c-4/c-2/c with colors s3/s2/s1); propagate downward row-by-row if the 3 columns match the pattern colors or are blank, filling blanks.
 * If at bottom row (row h-1), apply bottom pattern (asymmetric offsets: e.g., for k=s1, columns c/c+1/c+4 with s1/s2/s3); propagate upward similarly.
 * If singleton in middle row, simply extend its color horizontally across all consecutive blanks in that row (left and right).
 * Propagation subtlety: Only continues while all 3 pattern columns per row are either blank or already match the required color; stops on mismatch; fills only blanks, doesn't overwrite existing colors.
 * Stem detection requires exact run matching (no interruptions); paired detection checks for opposite type, adjacent column (abs(col diff)=1), and row overlap (max(start) < min(end)).
 * Counts exclude blanks (8); existing colors in grid must not be overwritten—program copies input and only fills 8s.
 * Edge cases: Short stems (<4) ignored; patterns must fit within width (0 to w-1), else skipped; downward/upward propagation stops at bounds; for type 2 offsets, length-2 may exceed height, so check r < h.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping stems/pairs may cause double-filling attempts (but since only fill 8s, it's safe but could propagate wrong if not checked); singleton patterns assume sorted s1/s2/s3, so wrong sorting breaks colors; horizontal extensions in stems don't propagate vertically unless special_down triggers.

(Note: process_isolated_stem and process_paired_stem orchestrate offsets/colors for sides; main program ties everything together by processing stems first, then singletons.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies singletons and stems, and handles propagation and horizontal extensions well, as evidenced by passing Training example 2 completely.
 * Failed Training example 1: Generated output is nearly identical to expected (e.g., same horizontal fills of 6s in row 20 positions 24-28, same 3-2-8... in rows 21-22 positions 22-23, same 5s/1s in rows 23-24), but marked INCORRECT—likely a subtle overfill or miss in stem processing (e.g., extra 3,2,8... row or failure to trigger special_down for s3 below a type 2 stem run, leaving a blank unfilled; exact diff unknown but present since marked wrong).
 * Stem pairing logic works for simple cases (as in train2) but may mishandle overlap calculation or away-side filling in train1 (e.g., if stems overlap partially, it might process as isolated instead of paired, filling both sides incorrectly).
 * Top/bottom patterns applied correctly in visible fills (e.g., no out-of-bounds), but asymmetry in bottom offsets may cause skips if columns don't fit.
 * Singleton horizontal extension in middle rows is basic but effective; no issues noted.
 * Overall, program copies input faithfully and only fills 8s, avoiding overwrites; early return if !=3 singletons prevents bad runs.
 * No unhelpful functions—all provided are relevant and build on each other; none appear broken, but process_paired_stem's break after first match may miss complex multi-pair setups (though unlikely).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct and follows the program's logic (e.g., horizontal fills of 9s/6s/7s in rows like 2,5,6,12,25-27 suggest stem-based extensions with colors possibly being singletons like 1,2,3,4; vertical patterns like 1s/2s in col 4-5 rows 0-6 match type 1/2 stems; right-side fills like 2-4 in col 24-25 rows 12-16 suggest middle singleton extension or paired stem away-side).
 * Does not look fully correct: Fills like row 2 cols 16-24 with 9s and row 3 col 18 with 3/4s seem abrupt/incomplete (possibly missed propagation from a top singleton, leaving isolated fills); row 11 cols 24-28 with 2,4,7s looks like bottom pattern but offsets don't align symmetrically (e.g., for s3 at bottom, expected c-4/c-3/c but here spread to 7s); row 29 cols 21-22 with 6,7 and col 26 with 9 seems like special_down trigger but isolated without clear stem run above, suggesting overfill or wrong s3 assumption; blanks remain in areas like row 7-10 entirely 8s, which may be correct if no stems/singletons influence but feels underfilled compared to dense left-side patterns.
 * Likely misses paired stem handling or propagation stops prematurely (e.g., if a mismatch in pattern columns halted vertical fill early, leaving blanks); the output makes sense for isolated stems but not for potential pairs (e.g., cols 4-5 have 1/2 but no away-side fill visible on right); account for multiple singletons propagating overlapping patterns to avoid partial fills in test cases with edge singletons.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:35:21] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a color-filling puzzle (similar to a logic grid or pattern propagation puzzle) where the input grid contains partial fills of colored cells (numbers 1-9) and blanks (8s), and the task is to propagate fills based on rules involving rare "singleton" colors (appearing exactly once), vertical "stems" (long runs of 1s or 2s), and specific horizontal/vertical patterns triggered by their positions and interactions. The solver must identify three singletons (s1 < s2 < s3), use their positions to seed patterns (e.g., top/bottom L-shapes or horizontal extensions), detect isolated or paired stems to extend fills horizontally or directionally, and avoid overfilling or conflicting with existing cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Exactly three singleton colors must exist (colors appearing once); if not, no further propagation—sort them as s1 < s2 < s3 for consistent patterning.
 * Singleton positions determine propagation: if at top row (row 0), use a downward-propagating "top pattern" (e.g., spaced columns with s3/s2/s1); if at bottom (row h-1), use upward-propagating "bottom pattern" (e.g., irregular offsets like c, c+1, c+4); if internal, just extend horizontally across the row.
 * Stems are vertical runs of >=4 consecutive 1s (type 1, perhaps "upward" stems) or 2s (type 2, perhaps "downward" stems) in a single column; only process if length >=4.
 * Isolated stems (no overlapping adjacent opposite-type stem) propagate horizontally at specific offsets: for type 1, offsets +1 (s1), +3 (s2), +5 (s3) with bidirectional fills; for type 2, offsets 0 (s3), 3 (s2), length-2 (s1) with bidirectional fills—only if row exists and doesn't exceed grid.
 * Paired stems (type 1 adjacent to type 2 with vertical overlap) propagate from the type 1 stem away from the pair at overlap offsets 0 (s1), 1 (s2), 3 (s3) in the direction opposite the pair.
 * Propagation checks compatibility: only fill if blank (8) or matching color, and stops if pattern can't apply (e.g., out-of-bounds or conflict); patterns are 3-column sets that repeat vertically until blocked.
 * Subtle: Patterns use specific column offsets (e.g., top: c-4/c-2/c for s3/s2/s1; bottom: irregular like c/c+1/c+4 for s1/s2/s3); bidirectional horizontal fills extend left/right from a seed until non-blank.
 * Easy to miss: Stem isolation checks vertical overlap with adjacent opposite-type stems (max(start) < min(end)); don't process non-isolated type 1 unless paired; order matters—process singletons first, then stems.
 * Conflicts: Never overwrite non-8 or non-matching cells; if singletons !=3, return input unchanged.
 * Grid assumptions: Rectangular (all rows same width), 0-indexed, h/len(g) rows, w/len(g[0]) columns; colors 1-9, 8=blank.
 * Across attempts: Stem finding only scans columns (vertical only); no diagonal or horizontal stems; propagation is greedy but stops on blocks—may need multiple passes if interdependent, but current code does one pass.

(Note: Functions like fill_in_direction, process_isolated_stems, and process_paired_type1_stems are helpful for stem propagation but have bugs—see below; they implement directional horizontal fills and stem processing logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly identifies singletons and their positions, sorting as s1/s2/s3, and handles top/bottom/internal cases with pattern propagation or horizontal extension—worked for seeding initial fills in train1 (e.g., filled some horizontal 1s/5s/6s around singletons) and train2 (e.g., extended some 1s horizontally).
 * Stem detection via find_stems works well, capturing vertical runs of 1/2 >=4 (e.g., detected type1 in col18 rows0-5 for train1, type2 in col21 rows23-25).
 * Isolation check is correct but underused: properly skips non-isolated stems, but process_isolated_stems overfills bidirectionally without bounds checks in some offsets (e.g., in train1, filled extra 1s/5s in rows10-15 col2, but expected has sparse fills like only row10 col2=1, row12 col2=1, etc., missing the pattern sparsity).
 * Paired stem processing (process_paired_type1_stems) is broken: it only handles type1 paired with type2, but offsets are calculated from overlap, and fill_in_direction uses fixed d without ensuring away direction; in train1, it filled incorrectly in right-side patterns (e.g., row18 col22=4 but expected 8; overfilled 6s in row20 cols24-28).
 * Propagation in propagate_pattern is mostly correct (checks bounds/conflicts, fills only 8s) but fails on irregular bottom patterns (e.g., in train1, bottom singleton handling missed upward fills in left columns like row10 col3=5 expected but generated 8 in some spots).
 * In train1: Generated extra fills in left singleton area (e.g., row10 col0=1 but expected 8; row11 col0=8 expected but generated 1? Wait, generated has row10: [8,8,1,5,...] matching expected, but row11: generated [1,1,1,5,...] vs expected [8,8,1,5,...]—overfilled row0-1 col0 with 1s; also row20 col23=2 expected but generated 4? Unknown why, perhaps stem offset miscalc; right side row18 col22=8 expected but generated 4 from paired stem. Overall, ~70% match but failed sparse verticals and some horizontals.
 * In train2: Singleton handling worked partially (e.g., filled row2 col14-22 with 1s matching), but stem processing failed: generated row11 col18-26=3s but expected only col18=3 then 8s? No, expected row11 col18-26=3s, but generated row11 col16=2, col17=1, col18=3... matching? Wait, differences in row10: generated [8,...4,1,8,...] vs expected [8,...4,1,3,3,...]—missed filling 3s from row10 col18 onward; row12 col18=8 generated vs 8 expected, but later rows like row19 all 8s matching. Failed to propagate some horizontal extensions from stems (e.g., missed 3s/6s/9s in mid-right). ~60% match, issues in paired/isolate distinction.
 * Function fill_in_direction is helpful for horizontal rays but broken: it fills in one direction (d=-1 or +1) from start_j until non-8, but in process_isolated_stems it's called bidirectionally (for dd in [-1,1]), yet may overfill if no block (e.g., train1 overfilled entire rows with s1/s2/s3).
 * process_isolated_stems and process_paired_type1_stems are partially helpful for logic but buggy: offsets for type2 use [0,3,l-2] which can exceed length (clipped but still wrong spacing); paired only processes type1, ignoring type2 pairs; no re-scan after fills, so interdependent stems missed.
 * extend_horizontal is correct and useful for internal singletons.
 * Overall, attempt shows good structure for singletons/stems but fails on precise offset application, overfilling horizontals, and incomplete paired handling—likely needs refined offsets, bidirectional checks in pairs, and possibly iterative propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it overfills large horizontal runs (e.g., row4 cols4-28 all 6s, row5 all 7s, row12 all 9s cols0-23 then 2/4/7s) which seem like unchecked bidirectional extensions from stems, but expected likely has sparser, pattern-based fills without full-row sweeps.
 * Missing sparse fills around singletons: e.g., input has singleton-like 1s in col4 rows0-1, but generated fills row0 cols0-3=8 (ok) but row1 col4=4? Input row1 col4=4 already, but propagation added extra 9s in row1 cols0-3 matching input? Wait, generated row2 col16-24=9s but input has 9s only col16-24? No, input row2: 8s then 9s col16-24 then 3/2s—generated matches but added row2 col4=4, col5=2 ok; however, row11 col24=2/4/7 overfills beyond input's sparse 7s.
 * Right side overfilled: e.g., rows17-23 col21=6, col22=7 repeatedly, but input has isolated 6/7 in row17 col21-22, suggesting no full vertical repeat—propagation didn't stop on existing non-8s properly, or misidentified stems.
 * Bottom left over/under: row25 col9=4, col10=2, then 9s cols11-20, but input row25 has 4/2 then 9s—matches, but row26 col11=6s overfills entire row? No, generated row26: 8s then 4/2/8s/6s col21/22/8s/9s—partial, but likely wrong as it ignores patterns for 3s in col9 row28.
 * Overall, test output makes some sense for aggressive horizontal/vertical fills from detected stems/singletons (e.g., filled vertical 6/7 in cols24-25 from input patterns), but looks incorrect due to overextension (full rows/columns without blocks) and missing subtle offsets (e.g., no irregular bottom patterns applied to input's bottom 1/4/2 in row16 col24-25); probably fails if expected has more isolated fills like in trainings.
